Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the race was postponed from April until October to maximise the chances of a mass participation event. The elite men's and women's event were won by Kenyan Amos Kipruto and Ethiopian Yalemzerf Yehualaw respectively. The wheelchair races were won by Swiss athletes Marcel Hug and Catherine Debrunner respectively, both in course record times. Over 40,000 people finished the mass participation event.\n\nBackground \n\nIn August 2021, the 2022 London Marathon was postponed from April until October, to increase the chances that such a large event could be held safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the third successive year that the race has been held in autumn. The 2023 event is scheduled to be held in April. In the United Kingdom, the event was broadcast on the BBC. Every race since 1981 has been televised on the BBC, and in June 2022, it won the rights to broadcast the race until 2026.\n\nThe winner of the men's and women's elite races each received $55,000. Prize money was also on offer for breaking a course record or beating a pre-specified time, and the total prize fund for each race was $313,000. The prize money for the wheelchair races was increased for 2022, with the winners receiving $35,000, an increase of $10,000 from the previous year. $20,000 and $15,000 was awarded to the competitors who finish second and third respectively, and for the first time the top 10 finishers all received prize money. The total prize fund for each of the wheelchair races was $199,500.\n\nCourse \n\nThe marathon distance is officially  long as sanctioned by World Athletics (IAAF). The London Marathon is run over a mainly flat course, starting in Blackheath. The course begins at three separate points and they converge just before  into the race. At just after  into the race, the runners reach the 19th-century clipper Cutty Sark docked in Greenwich and at about halfway into the race, the runners cross Tower Bridge before heading east into Shadwell and Canary Wharf. After winding through Canary Wharf, the route returns through Shadwell on the other side of the road to which it entered before passing through Tower Hill. The runners enter the underpass in Blackfriars before running along the Thames Embankment, past Westminster and onto Birdcage Walk. The course then runs parallel to St James's Park before turning onto The Mall and finishing in front of Buckingham Palace.\n\nCompetitors \n\nThe top three finishers in the 2021 elite women's race – winner Joyciline Jepkosgei and runners-up Degitu Azimeraw and Ashete Bekere – all competed in 2022.

cutty sarks home port on its maiden voyage the ship departed london on 15 february 1870 bound for shanghai on this outward voyage the ship carried a general cargo including wine spirits and beer and manufactured goods after successfully reaching china on 31 may the ship was loaded with 1305812 lbs of tea after only 25 days in port in shanghai the ship sped back to london arriving on 13 october

designed to carry tea from china to england as fast as possible 187883 tramping for cargoes murder and mutiny with steamers taking over the tea trade cutty sarks owners had to find a new future for the ship  but it was far from plain sailing 188395 the australian wool years the advent of cutty sarks teenage years marked her most successful phase as a working cargo ship  transporting wool from australia 18951922 the portuguese years dwindling margins saw cutty sarks owners take the decision to sell her off to a portuguese firm 1922 to present from falmouth to greenwich cutty sark was bought

10 pictures uncover the extraordinary life of the celebrated ship why did cutty sark stop trading tea the suez canal in the 1880s but it was not a practical option for sailing ships like cutty sark there were challenging wind conditions in the mediterranean and canal and there were expensive tolls to contend with instead steamships could now take advantage of this short cut to load greater amounts of tea and return to london at least ten days earlier than cutty sark could hope for after just eight voyages cutty sark was forced out of the trade for which it had been built image what records did cutty sark break after abandoning the tea tradecutty sark entered the australian wool trade in 1883 the ship made it back to london at least 25 days before any of its competitors marking the beginning of its most successful period two years later richard woodget became the captain of the ship in his tenyear service he mastered getting the most from his ship and men in 1886 he brought the ship back from sydney to london in a recordbreaking 73 days in order to catch the roaring forties trade winds around cape horn captain woodget pushed further south than previous commanders this meant the ship encountered icebergs and violent gales and seas but it also meant winds which could propel the ship home woodget took up photography in these years leaving us with an invaluable record of life on board cutty sark cutty sarks captains the ship had seven captains all of whom had to pass stringent examinations to become a mastermariner meet the captains what happened to cutty sark in the 1890s cutty sark began to make less money as more steam ships moved into the wool trade eventually the ship was sold to a portuguese firm and renamed ferreira it was used as a general cargo ship transporting goods between portugal and its empire when portugal declared war on germany the ship had to contend with unrestricted submarine warfare despite surviving this unscathed by the 1920s the ship was in poor condition and unlikely to survive much longer after suffering damage during bad weather the ship experienced astonishing good luck brought to falmouth for repairs it was spotted and recognised by local retired sea captain wilfred dowman determined to save the ship and restore it to former glory he offered to buy it for 3500  more than what the ship was worth even in 1895 the old name was restored in 1923 and cutty sark returned to british ownership image when did cutty sark come to greenwich tap to explore a new figurehead for cutty sark the art of figurehead carving the new
