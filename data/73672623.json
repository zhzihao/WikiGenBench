{"id": 73672623, "key": "Venetian Nights (Vice Principals)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian%20Nights%20%28Vice%20Principals%29", "text": "\"Venetian Nights\" is the eighth episode of the second season of the American dark comedy television series Vice Principals. It is the seventeenth overall episode of the series and was written by series co-creator Danny McBride, co-executive producer John Carcieri, and Jeff Fradley, and directed by McBride. It was released on HBO on November 5, 2017.\n\nThe series follows the co-vice principals of North Jackson High School, Neal Gamby and Lee Russell, both of which are disliked for their personalities. When the principal decides to retire, an outsider named Dr. Belinda Brown is assigned to succeed him. This prompts Gamby and Russell to put aside their differences and team up to take her down. In the episode, Gamby decides to confront Russell over his lies.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.610 million household viewers and gained a 0.3 ratings share among adults aged 18â€“49. The episode received extremely positive reviews from critics, who praised the humor, character development, tension and performances.\n\nPlot\nHaas (Brian Howe) announces that the school's results from the test were the best in the whole state, surprising the teachers and delighting Russell (Walton Goggins). He then brings all the teachers on stage to \"congratulate\" them, by making them more reachable to students and making them chaperones of their upcoming senior prom.\n\nRussell meets with Gamby (Danny McBride) at the train tracks. Gamby pulls out his sleeve gun, confronting him over shooting him, which Russell denies. Gamby tells Russell to resign to the board, or he will kill him the next day. Russell leaves the school, and Gamby informs Ray (Shea Whigham), Gale (Busy Philipps) and Janelle (Maya G. Love) that he closed the case, although he does not disclose the shooter. The next day, however, Russell shows up to work, dismissing Gamby's threat. Gamby informs Nash (Dale Dickey) and Terrance (Marcuis Harris), but they don't believe him either. He then asks Snodgrass (Georgia King) to trust him by revealing that he burned down Brown's house to help Russell, causing her to leave him.\n\nAngry at their treatment, Abbott (Edi Patterson) reveals to the teachers that Gamby is still friends with Russell. Gamby tries to claim that he is planning something, but they once again dislike him. He then decides to confront Russell in his office with the sleeve gun, but finds himself unable to pull the trigger. Russell then fires Gamby for trying to kill him. He leaves the school, but decides to return and brutally attacks Russell during a student television station broadcast. Their fight extends into the hallways, which ends when Terrance and Nash intercept Gamby and take him out of the school, humiliating him in front of everyone.\n\nThat night, Snodgrass visits Gamby at home, telling him that while he has a dark past, she knows he wants to rectify his mistakes. They meet with Christine (Susan Park) and Mi Cha (June Kyoto Lu), convincing them that they will take him down. Mi Cha directs them to Russell's storage unit, where he kept records. Christine provides them with a diary belonging to Russell's sisters, which contains the only way to defeat him. The next day, Gamby and Snodgrass summon teachers, cafeteria workers and bullies led by Robin (Alexandra McVicker) to the woods, convincing them that they can use the diary for their advantage.\n\nOn the \"Venetian Nights\" senior prom, the bullies corner Russell and lock him in a warehouse. There, Gamby appears with the diary and reads aloud some of Russell's embarrassing and evil actions, threatening to read it through the sound system to all the school unless he resigns. With no option, Russell signs his resignation and leaves. Gamby joins Snodgrass in the prom, where they kiss and dance. As Russell stays defeated outside, Abbott angrily stares at Gamby and Snodgrass dancing.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nIn October 2017, HBO confirmed that the episode would be titled \"Venetian Nights\", and that it would be written by series co-creator Danny McBride, co-executive producer John Carcieri, and Jeff Fradley, and directed by McBride. This was McBride's seventeenth writing credit, Carcieri's sixteenth writing credit, Fradley's fifth writing credit, and McBride's second directing credit.\n\nReception\n\nViewers\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Venetian Nights\" was seen by an estimated 0.610 million household viewers with a 0.3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.3 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 0.604 million viewers with a 0.2 in the 18-49 demographics.\n\nCritical reviews\n\"Venetian Nights\" received extremely positive reviews from critics. Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \"A\" grade and wrote, \"there may be no better string of scenes across the show's two season, and perhaps in any half-hour comedy this year, than the ones that make up the first half of 'Venetian Nights'.\"\n\nKaren Han of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"If you like stories with happy endings, put on a set of blinders and pretend this is the last episode of Vice Principals. 'Venetian Nights' plays almost like a dream: The prince, confronted by a great evil, tries to defeat it, only to be cast out from his own kingdom. But then, with the help of the townsfolk who also resent the evil's reign, he returns to cast it out for good and get the girl. It's a nice ending, except for the fact that the story isn't quite over. And if the rest of the show is anything to go by, I can't imagine that it's gonna be pretty.\" Nick Harley of Den of Geek gave the episode a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Season 2 of Vice Principals has been a vast improvement overall, but it hasn't been more apparent than in this episode. Expertly paced, tense yet silly, and impressively stylized, episodes like this will make me Vice Principals dearly once it concludes next week. With likely one more battle left in the war between VPs, I'm certain Vice Principals will go out with quite a large bang.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Venetian Nights\" at HBO\n \n\n2017 American television episodes\nVice Principals episodes\nTelevision episodes directed by Danny McBride\nTelevision episodes written by Danny McBride", "unikey": "Venetian Nights (Vice Principals)", "summary": "\"Venetian Nights\" is the eighth episode of the second season of the American dark comedy television series Vice Principals.

kevin hart vows to never host the oscarsfriday 524pmlakeith stanfield says his goto karaoke song is by death gripsfriday 214pmseason two of vice principals has been a marked improvement on the first the greatness that reared its head every now and then throughout the first season and especially in its back half has been front and center in nearly every episode this season the storytelling feels tighter and more inspired david gordon greens direction has provided a subtle anchor for the wild creative vision and on top of that the cast has found a new level of comfort with these characters where the first season was very much a showcase for the comedic viciousness of danny mcbride walton goggins and kimberly hebert gregory a sorely missed presence in season two this season has allowed the ensemble to flourish advertisementwith that in mind there may be no better string of scenes across the shows two season and perhaps in any halfhour comedy this year than the ones that make up the first half of venetian nights the first 15 minutes of this episode are some of most exquisitely paced incredibly funny and visually inspired comedy ive seen in 2017 every single beat every single line and every single shift of the camera seems to serve a purpose all building to a ludicrous manic crescendo that sees gamby and russell fighting their way through the entire school as everyone looks on in shock and delightadvertisementit all begins with superintendent haas announcing that the hasp scores are in and that north jackson high boasted the highest score in the state much to the shock of the teachers who tried to sabotage russell as we know there are two situations that allow walton goggins to shine as russell when hes struggling to remain in control and when hes basking in a sweet manipulative victory advertisementthis time russell is enjoying his moment he calls the five teachers who plotted against him up on to the stage and adorns them with paper gold star necklaces these are my gold star teachers he says he says how proud he is of them and how integral they are to the students success because of that he announces that each of them will now be available to the students 247 and that their personal emails and phone numbers will be posted for all to see its a notable scene because its not russell being the openly monstrous man we know he can be its more subtle and suggests that north jackson high is in for many more years of russell being a passive aggressive dictatorriding high on his victory russell then gets a note from gamby to meet at the train tracks and the two have their facetoface showdown thats been brewing all season but only threatened to truly come to a head after last weeks lateepisode discovery gamby hilariously pulls the exact same shtick he did earlier in the seasonso russell do you feel bad about shooting meand then tells russell that hes going to resign and never come back otherwise hell shoot him advertisementall of this plotting and scheming contributes to a truly manic pace and its the most fun the show has been all season danny mcbride stepping in to direct this single episode does a wonderful job of putting the scenes together in a way that not only builds the tension but also makes the cathartic payoff all the more intense after gamby gets chastised by the teachers for helping russell keep his jobthe students looking on in amazement as the teachers fling insults and curse words at each other is a great comedic touchthe episode becomes an avalanche of events that lead to the aforementioned fight through the school russell doesnt take gambys threat seriously and he confidently struts back into school the next day that sends gamby to snodgrass and he tells her everything saying that he needs to get the teachers on his side to take down the man he believes tried to kill him then when russell fires gamby venetian nights rolls out a scene of delightful chaos while russell delivers the morning announcements via live video gamby attacks him with a paddle and that sends them careening through the hallways cafeteria and eventually outside fighting each other with every object they can find food is thrown gamby throws his foe through a window and russell uses a wet floor sign as a giant snapping mouth on top of the chaos mcbride uses a number of long shots following gamby and russell as they run down the hallway like paul thomas anderson followed joaquin phoenix walking the pier in the master we get a sense of gamby and russell moving through time and space that adds to the turbulent atmosphere of the scene its this mix of carefully artful and patently absurd that vice principals often trades in and this is the pinnacle of that mixadvertisementof course venetian nights is much more than its incredible first 15 minutes its also the storm before the calm before the storm in a way venetian nights sees gamby triumph once and for all he convinces christine and micha to help him blackmail russell they give him a diary that his sisters kept detailing all of young russells depravities gamby threatens to read it over the schools pa system during prom night if russell doesnt leave north jackson high once and for all its a great build to a final scene that sees gamby finally get one up on russell big black deltas roost builds to an electronic catharsis and gamby and snodgrass kiss in the neon light evoking the aesthetic of drive or only god forgives but like those films revenge is certainly on the horizon and this cant be the last weve seen of russell we already know that mcbride and company can construct a surreal unforgettable season finale now we get to see what they do with a series finale when theres no limit to what they can put these characters throughadvertisementstray
