{"id": 73430882, "key": "Mecum Auctions", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecum%20Auctions", "text": "Mecum Auctions is an American auction company specializing in collector cars. It was founded by Dana Mecum in 1988, and was originally based in Marengo, Illinois. Since 2011, it has been headquartered in Walworth, Wisconsin. The company hosts various auction events across the United States. Television coverage began in 2008, contributing to the popularity of the events.\n\nHistory\nMecum Auctions was founded in 1988 by Dana Mecum, a car enthusiast whose father operated a dealership in Marengo, Illinois. Dana Mecum initially bought 40 semi-trailer trucks in the 1980s, and traded 10 of them for four houses which he rented out. According to him, \"The tenants started calling me in the middle of the night to fix this and that. So I went back to the guy I traded the trucks to and gave him his houses back and told him he could keep the trucks. He said, 'You know, you're going to lose a lot of money,' and I said, 'Yeah, but I'm going to get a lot of sleep'\". Mecum subsequently traded his remaining trucks to a North Carolina man in exchange for 40 collector cars; these, in addition to his own collection of 15 cars, prompted him to hold an auto auction.\n\nThe company's first auction was held in Rockford, Illinois in 1988. It was intended as a one-time event, but was derailed by 90-mile-per-hour winds, followed by lawsuits from dissatisfied attendees. This prompted Mecum to hold another auction the following year. He would go on to continue the auctions for 14 years before finally turning a profit. During that time, he was approached by a prospective buyer who eventually declined the $500,000 sale price, which represented the amount of debt Mecum owed. The company auctioned its 50,000th vehicle in 2008. Mecum Auctions was headquartered in Marengo for years, before relocating to Walworth, Wisconsin in 2011. It is one of the area's top employers, with more than 300 workers.\n\nSince 2013, Mecum Auctions has been overseen by chief executive officer Dave Magers, who formerly served as chief financial officer of Country Financial. Dana Mecum had previously overseen the company himself: \"I was a control freak, and around 1999 I got sick and had to let go and let other people do things. That was part of how I got sick: I was trying to do everything\". Mecum remains involved in the business as president, operating it with help from his wife and their four sons, including Frank Mecum as consignment director. A new trucking division, Mecum Auto Transport, was established in 2017. It provides transportation, via semi-trailers, for consigned and sold vehicles.\n\nAuction overview\nMecum's auctions attract a varied clientele, including a large number of non-bidding spectators, who make up approximately 90 percent of attendees. Events receive anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 attendees.\n\nThe inaugural auction event, known as the Rockford Spring Classic, was held at the Greater Rockford Airport in 1988. During the next two years, it was held at the Metro Center, also in Rockford. In 1991, the event relocated to the Boone County fairgrounds in Belvidere, Illinois. Despite the location change, the event retained the Rockford name. Auctions in Belvidere typically attracted 12,000 to 15,000 people.\n\nIn 1996, Mecum added premier auctions, offering vehicles of a higher quality and attracting approximately 1,000 people to each event. By that point, Mecum also hosted an annual Chevrolet auction in Grayslake, Illinois. It was one of the largest Chevy-focused auction events in North America. In addition, the company also hosted Bloomington Gold, a Corvette-focused event held each June in Bloomington, Illinois. Mecum purchased the rights to the show in the 1990s, before selling them in 2012. Mecum announced two years later that it would no longer participate in the event due to diminishing interest. By that point, many of Mecum's regional auctions now offered Corvettes, attracting local buyers who had since found the Bloomington location to be less convenient. Sales for the 2013 event had reached only $1.8 million, down from a high of $7.7 million in 2008.\n\nAs of 2016, Mecum auctions 15,000 vehicles annually, ranging from muscle cars to pre-World War I vehicles, with annual sales of $300 million. The company specializes in muscle cars from the 1950s to 1970s. By 2017, the company had added separate auction events dealing solely with motorcycles and farmer tractors respectively. It also added road art to its main auctions. As of 2017, the company hosts 14 annual events across the U.S., including a $100 million, 10-day main event each January in Kissimmee, Florida. It is Mecum's largest annual auction, growing considerably from the company's first Florida event, held in 2002.\n\nOther auction locations have included Anaheim, California, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Indianapolis, Indiana, Las Vegas, Nevada, and Monterey, California. The events are overseen by a traveling team of 200 workers, and the vehicles often have a history related to the region where they are being auctioned. Some vehicles are auctioned to raise money for charities, such as the last Mitsubishi Eclipse ever manufactured (2011).\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Mecum revamped its online bidding system and added livestream footage of auction events. Online bidding saw a marked increase following the redesign, which also contributed to a rise in revenue, with a record $675 million brought in during 2021.\n\nTelevision coverage\nTelevision coverage of the auctions began in 2008, around the start of the Great Recession. Up to that time, approximately 90 percent of Mecum's buyers were car dealers who would resell the vehicles after auction. Many of the dealers went out of business due to the recession, and the remainder would become sellers at Mecum auctions. The television coverage produced a large number of buyers who were end consumers, as opposed to dealers. According to Dana Mecum, \"Without TV, not only would we not have grown, we might not have survived\".\n\nThe auctions were originally broadcast on Discovery HD, which became Velocity in 2011. NBC Sports Network (NBCSN) took over coverage in 2014, and viewership saw an increase of more than 500 percent. As of 2017, the auctions attracted more viewers for the network than any other event with the exception of Premier League football. NBCSN ceased operations in December 2021, and Motor Trend took over coverage the following month.\n\nMecum Dealmakers, a television program chronicling the auction preparations and management, also aired on NBCSN from 2014 to 2015.\n\nNotable sales\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\n1988 establishments in Illinois\nAmerican auction houses\nAmerican companies established in 1988\nCompanies based in Wisconsin", "unikey": "Mecum Auctions", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["History", "Auction_overview", "Television_coverage", "Notable_sales", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Mecum Auctions was founded in 1988 by Dana Mecum,a car enthusiast whose father operated a dealership inMarengo, Illinois.Dana Mecum initially bought 40semi-trailer trucksin the 1980s, and traded 10 of them for four houses which he rented out.

were ready to shift gears and move to a mobile company on the flysome cities were unwilling to host a car auction no matter what precautions were taken but mecum has done its best to mitigate spread as much possible by cutting seating way back allowing no more than two people per table running temp checks at the door providing hand washing stations and of course requiring masksthe fact that it is broadcast on tv means its even more important that theyre showing the world they have a good program and theyre enforcing it mecum director of company relations and tv commentator john kramer told me

you press a buttonover four months of lockdown the company built a new system that implements livestreaming video meant to make you feel like youre sitting in the front row of a fastpaced auction the

more internet bidders from around the world actually inspired more spirited bidding and resulted in higher sales numbersthe more people that are bidding on a car the higher the price will be says magers adding that mecum was also experiencing pentup demand from an audience that was eager to spend money after being cooped up in their homes during the pandemic  a phenomenon that affected consumers and businesses in a variety of marketswhat we saw was prices started to rise relatively dramatically during the pandemic because of that competition because of built up resources he says

dies frank said that in many cases the collectors consigning their vehicles are still relatively young and healthy but have decided theyve had their cars long enough and that its time for them to reboot their collections still buying but now perhaps in pursuit of restomods or hot rods or some other genre that has piqued their interest at the same time he added young people guys my age in their mid30s and 40s are entering the market theyve had their families have become successful in business and are starting to attend the auctions magers noted that there also is a growing number of people in their 50s just now entering the hobby in their case theyve raised their families even put their children through college and with good income and less family responsibilities are entering the hobby a little later in life mecum and magers said many such newcomers are drawn to mecum auctions because of the companys presence on social media and on both live and packagedprogramming television not only are the auctions covered by nbcsn sports network but mecum is in the second season of its top 10 series halfhour segments with a specific theme such as top10 mustangs or top10 corvettes shows which draw a large and young audience and not only domestically but with strong international viewership dave magers checks mecum sales numbers magers said part of the companys recent success traces to a decision several years ago to invest in the brand and the venues one of those investments was made by dana mecum in 2013 when he hired magers an accountant and former insurance company executive to become president and to work with mecum on strategic planning in part to grow the business and to allow dana mecum to focus on cars customers  and grandchildren those investments included upgrades such a huge new auction blockstage the first of the glass house showcases this year the clearsided temporary building housing the top cars at kissimmee stretches 500 feet in length and other changes to facilities for example there are long lines of people eager to experience tireburning thrill rides in the latest and most powerful products from dodge and this year theres a new bandstand with live music at kissimmee where mecum also will stage a cooking contest saturday featuring alex guarnaschelli of the food channel mecum founded in northern illinois and now based in southeastern wisconsin expanded its auction offerings taking them to new venues and to new customers going west of locations such as denver and portland and even to monterey california and east most notably and successfully to harrisburg pennsylvania glass house spans 500 feet and showcases featured vehicles most recently it staged its inaugural collector car sale in las vegas where its motorcycle department already holds two annual vintage bike auctions it also has a division that specializes in vintage farm equipment auctions and another that focuses on road art mecums name for automobilia the company continues to consider additional geographic targets while its kissimmee indianapolis monterey and most likely las vegas auctions become destinations added to the bucket lists of people involved in or new to the hobby we want to make it as easy to do business with us as we possibly can magers said and he was talking about more than the companys geographic footprint one goal he said was for someone to be able to attend a mecum auction post the high bid on a vehicle and have it financed insured detailed and delivered to the new owners garage through 303 carcare products and partnerships including state farm insurance that goal finally has been achieved he said with the recent launch of mecum auto transport which now includes a dozen semi tractors and enclosed carhauling trailers that are doing so much business they fleet likely will be growing very soon mecum has added a fleet of car carriers to deliver auction vehicles to their new owners growing as well it seems is the fleet of available collector cars those lamenting the end of the hobby may forget that as frank mecum reminded there are around 27 million vehicles in the united states covered by collector car insurance of those less than 1 percent around 25000 are sold each year at collector car auctions yes there is a huge supply side out there but there also is a healthy and even growing demand as well through efforts such as those being undertaken by mecum and others in the hobby the pool of potential buyers is expanding bidders fill the seats at mecums kissimmee sale tagskissimmee 2018mecum auctions related articles
