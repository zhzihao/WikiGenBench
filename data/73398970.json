{"id": 73398970, "key": "Nipple reconstruction surgery", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipple%20reconstruction%20surgery", "text": "Nipple reconstruction, specifically nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, is a procedure commonly done for patients who had part or all of their nipple removed due to medical reasons. For example, NAC reconstruction can apply to breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy, the surgical removal of a breast. NAC reconstruction can also be applied to patients with trauma, burn injuries, and congenital or pathological abnormalities in nipple development.\n\nThe visual appearance of the NAC, including its relative position, size, color, shape and texture, vary between individuals. Hence, aesthetics is an important consideration when surgeons are reconstructing the NAC, so it can appear natural and pleasing to the patient. There are different methods to NAC reconstruction, however in general the procedure is safe and can be conducted under local anesthesia.\n\nDevelopment of NAC reconstruction techniques \nThroughout history, different methods for NAC reconstruction have been proposed and implicated.\n\nComposite graft reconstruction \nIn 1949, Adams used a composite graft from the labia minora, which is the skin surrounding the vagina, to create the first reconstructed NAC.\n\nNipple sharing \nIn 1972, Millard described a new method called \"nipple sharing\". In this method, a split-skin graft from the patient's contralateral nipple is used to reconstruct a new nipple. This method was commonly used as it was often successful in achieving matching pigment and texture between the reconstructed nipple and the contralateral nipple. However, it still has risks of infection, pain, numbness, scarring, and depigmentation. Nipple sharing may still be conducted today for patients with nipples that are taller than 1 cm in height.\n\nFlap-based techniques \nIn the 1980s, flap-based techniques for reconstruction became increasingly popular. Such techniques involve incising a small flap of skin on the patient's breast, and raising the flap so it forms a shape that resembles a nipple. In general, a reconstructed nipple tends to gradually shrink over time. However, an advantage of flap-based techniques is that surgeons can construct a nipple that is slightly taller than normal, to counteract the inevitable shrinking of the reconstructed nipple.\n\nTissue engineering and regenerative medicine \nIn the 21st century, advancements in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine hold the potential in developing techniques for nipple reconstruction. For instance, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine can help researchers develop suitable and safe nipple implants.\n\nImpact on patient well-being \nRegardless of the technique used for NAC reconstruction, the main goal is to recreate a normal appearance of the breasts and therefore bring satisfaction to the patient. Therefore, the ultimate aim of NAC reconstruction is to benefit the well-being of the patient.\n\nNAC reconstruction has shown to have positive psychological effects on patients, especially to those who have undergone a mastectomy. These patients have to get their breast glandular tissue completely removed, resulting in the surgical removal of their breasts. Post-procedure, patients might suffer from body image issues, sexual dysfunction, and low self-esteem. NAC reconstruction has been shown to reduce the psychological impacts that patients might face following a mastectomy. This is especially the case for female patients, as the breasts play a key role in the female identity. NAC reconstruction has reportedly empowered female patients by improving their body image and helping them overcome the psychological challenges from having breast cancer.\n\nMoreover, NAC reconstruction has been shown to positively influence a patient's body image. A study indicated that patients who had both NAC reconstruction and breast reconstruction saw improvements in the overall appearance and sensation of their breasts.\n\nAnatomy of the nipple-areola complex \nSimilar to the breast, each NAC is unique. The anatomy of the NAC differs in size, texture, and color between different ethnicities and individuals. Oftentimes, a patient may have two areolas of different morphology. The nipple itself is defined as a protruded structure containing an abundance of sensory nerve endings and smooth muscle bundles facilitating erection for breastfeeding. It is located on the center of a pigmented patch on the breast, known as the areola. Although there is no standard dimension for the NAC, the approximately 4-7mm nipple can protrude for over 1 cm from the typically 4.2-4.5cm diameter areola. \n\nWithin the areola, gross anatomy includes the lactiferous ducts that drain the 15-20 mammary gland lobes extending into the depths of the breast. The areolas cellular composition includes an assortment of cells and specific tissues that support the primary function of the mammary glands, secretion and drainage of breast milk during lactation. The NAC is supported by stratified keratinized squamous epithelium that extend towards the surface of the nipple ducts. This pathway facilitates metastasis of carcinomas such as, syringomatous adenomas, throughout the areola, it can allow cancer cells in the subareolar ducts to travel to the nipple skin. On the surface of the areola, there are bumps denoted as Morgagni tubercles, which connect to the Montgomery glands. The montgomery glands are modified sebaceous glands connected to premature mammary glands, this connection facilitates secretion of milk during lactation through areolar lubrication.\n\nTo support the structures within the NAC, vascularization mainly depends on the dermal and subdermal plexuses. These networks of blood vessels include the internal and external mammary arteries in the subcutaneous tissue which primarily provide blood to the NAC alongside the thoracoacromial arteries and intercostal perforator arteries. Provision of blood to the base of the nipple is accomplished through branching vessels of the mammary arteries. However, each breast would have different vasculature and can be affected by breast and NAC reconstruction procedures.\n\nProcedures \nThe purpose of NAC reconstruction, which is often performed a few months after other breast related operations are completed, is to create a 3-dimensional structure from a 2-dimensional template such as breast skin. Over time, more than 60 techniques have been introduced. There are several procedures under the NAC reconstruction category, with mainstream options being flap based construction, augmentation grafting, nipple sharing, and 3d tattoos.\n\nNipple sharing \nNipple sharing is one of the pioneers of NAC and was first introduced in 1972. It is mainly applied for nipples that have a contralateral height of over 1 cm. Nipple sharing utilizes the most anterior part of the donor or native nipple or a wedge of the donor nipple is surgically removed to be used as a graft. Within this branch there are two techniques, longitudinal splitting and decapitation. For decapitation, at least 50% of a donor's nipple should be preserved to ensure nipple erection and sensation. To transplant the donor nipple, it is sutured onto the patient when the area of treatment undergoes removal of epithelial cells. As this procedure only forms the most anterior part of the NAC, the areola is typically 3D-tattooed.\n\n3D tattooing \n3D tattooing is recommended for patients who cannot undergo surgery due to risk of complications. Tattoo-artists imitate the morphological features of the nipple through detail and shading, creating the optical illusion and a 3-dimensional nipple despite the surface being flat.\n\nFlap-based construction \nThere are many types of flap based construction, with the most common one being local flaps, which has a few subcategories . These subcategories include centrally based flaps, subdermal pedicled flaps, and purse-string flaps. In terms of shape, there have been star flap, skate flap, S-flap, H-flap, C-V flap, arrow flap, cylindrical flap, and more. A common weakness of local flap based construction techniques is the loss of projection and diameter. The technique mainly involves suturing different skin flaps, known as dermal fat flaps, together to form the shape of the NAC.\n\nAugmented grafting \nAugmented grafting is often an additional procedure to refine the structure of the reconstructed nipple that experienced flattening as an adverse effect due to the loss of smooth connective tissue support and wound scarring. The procedure aims to increase nipple projection through autologous or heterologous materials. Autologous tissues include structural supporters such as dermis, cartilage from the ribs or rim of the ear, adipose or fat tissue, and mucosa from the oral cavity. Some procedures can facilitate the attainment of costal cartilage such as internal mammary vessel dissection for flap based- breast reconstruction procedures. Heterologous materials can be allogeneic natural materials or synthetic foreign bodies l. Synthetic foreign bodies mainly act as scaffolding to allow the hosts' own cells to recellularize the affected NAC itself. Due to foreign body response, alloplastic materials come with higher risk of complications compared to autologous grafts. Such complications include protruding implants, necrosis, dyschromia, loss of sensation, and wound dehiscence.\n\nPostoperative care \n\nPostoperative care is relatively short as dressing is typically maintained for 2 weeks. Some common dressings include covering the area of operation with antibiotic cream, petroleum jelly dressing, stacking gauze, and nipple guards. In addition to protection of the reconstructed nipple, analgesic painkillers are prescribed other than some flap reconstruction cases where sensation has yet to be restored. 2 weeks post-operation, sutures can be removed which may result in a longer a pointier nipple projection for 1 month when the elongated c-flap is used for reconstruction. As recovery is quite quick, patients’ regular routines are not disrupted unless complications occur.\n\nRisks and complications \nThere are risks involved in nipple reconstruction. Upon completion of the procedure, patients are at risk of flap necrosis, local infections, separation of tissue due to improper wound healing, and accumulation of fluid in an orifice of the breast (seroma).  Flap necrosis is a common adverse effect that accompanies breast augmentation surgeries including mastectomies but systematic reviews have shown that this can be reduced through application of nitroglycerin ointment.  \n\nA direct side effect of nipple reconstruction is the long-term loss of nipple projection; this is a sign that the procedure has failed if over 80% of pre-procedure projection has been lost over time. The loss of projection is often a mental burden for patients that receive NAC reconstruction. Currently, there are no techniques that prevent the loss of projection over time. The loss of projection has similar mechanisms to the inverted nipple, in which fibrous muscle bands at the base of the nipple are unable to retract normally. The erection of a nipple is dependent on the sympathetic nervous system and the smooth muscles within the nipple, thus if the nipple receives damage there would be loss of projection. Specifically, procedures can cause the loss of projection due to scar contracture, surrounding skin causing retraction, and the lack of blood perfusion within the area. Although there are no existing procedures that prevent loss of nipple projection, augmentation grafting or repetition of local flaps can be done to recover some projection. However, some procedures such as longitudinal splitting and decapitation only reduce projection by 50%.\n\nReferences \n\nBreast surgery\nNipple", "unikey": "Nipple reconstruction surgery", "summary": "Nipple reconstruction, specifically nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, is a procedure commonly done for patients who had part or all of their nipple removed due to medical reasons.[1] For example, NAC reconstruction can apply to breast cancer patients who underwent a mastectomy, the surgical removal of a breast.[2][3] NAC reconstruction can also be applied to patients with trauma, burn injuries, and congenital or pathological abnormalities in nipple development.[4][5]\n", "outlines": ["Development_of_NAC_reconstruction_techniques", "Impact_on_patient_well-being", "Anatomy_of_the_nipple-areola_complex", "Procedures", "Postoperative_care", "Risks_and_complications", "References"], "contents": ["Throughout history, different methods for NAC reconstruction have been proposed and implicated.\n### Composite graft reconstruction\nIn 1949, Adams used a composite graft from thelabia minora, which is the skin surrounding the vagina,to create the first reconstructed NAC.\n### Nipple sharing\nIn 1972, Millard described a new method called \"nipple sharing\".In this method, a split-skin graft from the patient's contralateralnippleis used to reconstruct a newnipple.

introduced since 1940s and evolved as parallel with breast reconstruction since era of breast cancer treatment it consists of nipple and areolar reconstruction ideal reconstruction of the nac requires symmetry in position size shape texture and pigmentation and permanent projection there are many innovative ways to create a nipple and each method has its unique characteristics that apply to certain breast types nac reconstruction techniques comprises of composite nipple grafts local flap flaps with autologous graft augmentation flaps with alloplastic augmentation and flaps with allograft augmentation areolar reconstruction by using skin grafting and tattooing are the easiest and most common techniques with the evolution of techniques and technology perhaps the newer methods of nac reconstruction can produce promising longlasting aesthetically acceptable result with minimal morbidity keywords nipple areolar reconstruction allograft alloplastic autologous graft composite nipple

of the nippleareolar complex make this breast region special the nippleareolar complex can be affected by abnormal development and a wide spectrum of pathological conditions many of which have unspecific clinical and radiological presentations that can present a challenge for radiologists the nippleareolar complex requires a specific imaging workup in which a multimodal approach is essential radiologists need to know the different imaging modalities used to study the nippleareolar complex as well as their advantages and limitations it is essential to get acquainted with the acquisition technique for each modality and the spectrum of findings for the different conditions this review describes and illustrates a combined clinical and radiological approach to evaluate the nippleareolar complex emphasizing the findings for the normal morphology developmental abnormalities and the most common benign and malignant diseases that can affect this region we also present a

the final critical process used to achieve breast symmetry patient satisfaction and overall reconstruction completeness here we introduce our simplified simultaneous nac reconstruction approach with nipple sharing and tattooing that resulted in minimal morbidity high patient satisfaction and a shortened total reconstructive period methods patients who underwent simultaneous nipple sharing and tattooing between july 2012 and december 2017 after the final operative procedure or adjuvant therapy were included we retrospectively evaluated breast reconstruction type interval between breast and nac reconstruction mean operation time for simultaneous nipple sharing and tattooing and postoperative complications overall patient satisfaction and willingness to undergo simultaneous nac reconstruction again were assessed results the mean interval between the final operative procedure or adjuvant therapy and nac reconstruction was 44 44 and 67 months in nonadjuvant patients those who underwent chemotherapy and those who underwent radiotherapy respectively the mean operation time for simultaneous nac reconstruction was 46 min no major complications such as infection or total nipple loss were observed regardless of breast reconstruction type at least 6 months postoperatively the average overall satisfaction was 80 on a 10point scale and 969 of patients indicated that they would undergo this simultaneous nac reconstruction again conclusions our simplified technique of simultaneous nipple sharing and tattooing is safe and reliable and features high patient satisfaction rates additionally it can be performed in the clinical setting and is convenient for patients and surgeons alike since it features a decreased total reconstruction period level of evidence iv this journal

achieve longterm projection of the nipple following nippleareola reconstruction however the reconstructed nipple loses projection over time we describe a technique that uses local flaps to improve the lost projection of reconstructed nipples methods between november 2013 and march 2015 nine patients 11 nipples underwent revisional nipple reconstruction for lost projection only ch nipple reconstructions were included in this study the medical history of each patient was reviewed and photographs were taken in front and lateral views all patients attended routine followup visits deepithelialized triangular flaps were made on all four sides of the nipple and buried in the opposite corners in order to augment the volume of the nipple anchoring sutures were used to attach each triangular flap on the side opposite their point of origin and the resulting defects were closed directly results this procedure was used successfully in nine patients 11 nipples adequate projection was achieved in all patients and no complications occurred the average nipple height was 3 mm before operation 7 mm one day after operation 5 mm at the sixmonth followup and 5 mm at the 12month followup the average nippleareolar angle was 164 before the operation 111 one day after the operation 130 at the sixmonth followup and 133 at the 12month followup conclusions the method described provides a solution to the loss of projection in reconstructed nipples we recommend this technique because it leads to better projection greater volume and a more natural shape keywords mammoplasty

many plastic surgeons have looked to allogeneic tissue and alloplastic materials as a possible source of structure for longlasting nippleareola complex reconstruction furthermore in light of the recent mandate from the food and drug administration restricting the marketing and direct indication of acellular dermal matrices adms in breast reconstruction we sought to highlight the overall safety and efficacy demonstrated in the existing literature surrounding all alloplastic materials in nippleareola complex reconstruction in this study the authors conduct a systematic review and pooled outcomes analysis on allogenic and alloplastic implant materials utilized to achieve longlasting nipple projection stratified by specific material used and respective outcomes methods a comprehensive systematic review on allogenic and synthetic materials data utilized in nipple reconstruction was conducted utilizing medlinepubmed database articles were stratified by 1 alloplastic material as well as 2 objective and patientreported outcomes results a total of 592 nippleareola complexes on 482 patients were featured in 15 case series in all studies alloplastic or allograft material was utilized to achieve and maintain nipple projection subjective measurements revealed a patient satisfaction rate of 933 or higher with the majority of patients being very satisfied with their reconstruction the alloplastic and allograft implants analyzed had an overall complication rate of 53 across all materials used the most common complication reported was flap or graft necrosis with a pooled rate of 25 overall the ceratite implant presented with the highest complication rate 18 including flapgraft necrosis 13 and extrusion of the artificial bone 5 other rigid implants such as the biodesign nipple reconstruction cylinder reported complications of extrusion 36 projection loss requiring revision 25 wound dehiscencedrainage 15 flap or graft necrosis 10 and excessive bleeding 05 adm implants had reported complications of both insufficient projection 08 and excessive projection 16 which required surgical revision injectable materials had minimal reported complications of pain during injection 08 with radiesse and a falsepositive pet scan result 08 with dermalive conclusions allogeneic and alloplastic grafts are a reliable means of achieving satisfactory nipple projection with a relatively low overall complication profile the use of ceratite artificial bone led to the highest complication rates further clinical studies are necessary to better understand the feasibility and longerterm outcomes of the use of allogeneic and synthetic augmentation grafts to improve nipple projection level of evidence iii this journal requires that

complication after mastectomy and nitroglycerin ntg ointment has been used successfully to treat it however it is not clear whether topical ntg can completely prevent the occurrence of flap necrosis after breast cancer surgery and it is also unclear whether this treatment may cause side effects three randomized controlled trials rcts and two retrospective cohort studies rcss were included in our investigation this metaanalysis was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses prisma guidelines we found that ntg significantly reduced the rates of mastectomy flap necrosis fullthickness flap necrosis and debridement as well as the rate of early complications other than flap necrosis however there was no significant difference in drugrelated adverse reactions explantation superficial flap necrosis infection hematoma or seroma between the ntg and placebo groupssubject terms preventive medicine outcomes researchintroductionflaprelated complications are extremely common after breast surgery among them flap necrosis is the most serious and leads to a poor prognosis in the literature the reported rates of mastectomy flap necrosis mfn range from 5 to 3019 the rate may continue to rise as nipplesparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction ibr become more prevalent in young breast cancer patients although there is some evidence that the risks of flap necrosis and implant failure are higher in ibr than in mastectomy alone10nitroglycerin ntg effectively increases local blood flow by dilating arteries and veins without altering the ratio of precapillary to postcapillary resistance many studies have shown that ntg treatment may improve the survival of randompattern skin flaps by increasing local blood flow1113 nonetheless not all studies confirm the utility of ntg in skin flap preservation several scholars have found that daily application of ntg slowrelease pads offer no greater flap survival than a control treatment1417 furthermore some of the side effects of ntg may limit its use however ricci has argued that ntg is safe and effective and does not increase the occurrence of side effects18given the lack of consensus on the use of ntg to prevent mfn the purpose of this metaanalysis is to determine the efficacy and safety of ntg for the prevention of mfndebridement is an important solution to skin flap necrosis but it causes psychological and physical trauma to patients further attention should be paid to the debridement rate after mastectomy especially after ibr in which circumstances it may cause the tissue expanderimplant to be lost unfortunately some studies have suggested that ntg cannot reduce the rate of debridement after ibr1921 hence another purpose of this article is to determine whether ntg can reduce the flap debridement rate after mastectomymethodsour metaanalysis was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses prisma guidelines22 a study flow chart based on the prisma statement was constructed to show all literature search resultssearch strategy and eligibility criteriathe searched databases included the following embase pubmed and google scholar the keywords consisted of nitroglycerin and breast and flap necrosis the databases were searched from inception through may 4 2019 two authors pw and lsg independently inspected the titles and abstracts of potentially qualified studies any differences were discussed until a consensus was reached in order to be included articles needed to meet the criteria 1 the subjects were women of any age who had a mastectomy with or without ibr 2 ntg was used to prevent mfn 3 the complication rates and side effects of ntg were reported the exclusion criteria were as follows 1 research on skin flaps at other sites 2 comparisons between ntg and other medications to prevent flap necrosis 3 animal experiments and 4

radiotherapy diabetes obesity and increased breast volume2834 these risk factors may influence the blood supply of the flap if the perfusion of the mastectomy skin flap with sufficient oxygenated hemoglobin is compromised necrosis may ensue the use of vasodilators to treat vasospasm may reduce the necrosis rate of skin flaps1317 as a direct vasodilator ntg has been shown to reduce the necrosis rate of random flaps1217 papaverine is considered an effective spasmolytic agent because of its quick onset and suitable duration of action ricci reported that substituting topical ntg for papaverine to treat vasospasm during a shortage was not associated with an increased rate of flap loss or return to the operating room making ntg a safe alternative to papaverine after breast reconstruction18the ultimate benefits of ntg use for mastectomy may be a decreased rate of mfn mfn is one of the most severe complications leading to surgical failure in mastectomy reconstruction after mastectomy is gaining popularity and a metaanalysis reported by basta et al stated that ibr was associated with an elevated risk of mfn and reoperation10 therefore in this study ibr was separated from mastectomy alone for the analysis in our study the pooled results from 7074 patients indicated that ntg significantly decreased the mfn rate in both ibr and indirect reconstruction mfn may present as partialthickness superficial or fullthickness necrosis the treatment of superficial flap necrosis is different from that of fullthickness skin flap necrosis nevertheless many papers did not differentiate between partialthickness mfn which may be treated with observation in some cases and fullthickness mfn which requires debridement1035 the current study analyzed those two groups separately and the results showed that ntg could reduce the incidence of fullthickness flap necrosis however the drug had no significant effect on the rate of superficial flap necrosisonce mfn occurs it is difficult to resolve debridement is inevitable when necrosis is severe especially for fullthickness skin flap necrosis turin et al21 divided debridement procedures according to whether they were performed in the office or the operating room it was found that ntg could significantly reduce the total and inoffice debridement rates but could not reduce the rate of debridement in the operating room gdalevitch et al divided debridement cases into a local anesthesia group and a general anesthesia group19 finding that ntg could not reduce the debridement rate in both groups similar to turins work our study found that the debridement rate decreased significantly after the use of ntg or 032 95 ci 021051 p  001 which suggested that the use of ntg reduced the probability of reoperationimplant loss is a serious complication after ibr unfortunately ntg has not been shown to reduce the risk of implant loss following ibr a metaanalysis by basta concluded that the risk of implant loss may decrease as the quality of the mastectomy tissue increases10 gdalevitch et al and turin et al reported that there were no significant differences in implant loss between ntg and control groups1921 the results of our metaanalysis are in agreement with the findings mentioned aboventg acts by releasing nitric oxide into vascular smooth muscle cells this action stimulates the release of cgmp causing relaxation of these muscle cells and consequent vasodilation18 this medication has been demonstrated to be effective in treating vasospasm in other diseases of the brain and heart and its safety in humans has been well documented however attention must still be paid to ntgrelated adverse reactions such as headache dizziness and hypotension interestingly this study demonstrated that there was no significant difference in drugrelated adverse reactions between the ntg and control groups nevertheless we recommend caution when ntg is used in patients with hypotension and those who take antihypertensive medicationswe also pooled the data on early complications including 3 events hematoma seroma and infection these complications have an important impact on patients postoperative recovery the total rate of early complications was significantly lower in the ntg group than in the control group or 059 95 ci 036098 p  005 regrettably there was no difference in individual complications between these two groupssome limitations of this metaanalysis should be addressed first the included studies used different ntg doses and the dressing types also varied mainly including transdermal paste and ointment second most of the included articles were retrospective studies rather than rcts this limitation leaves a large gap in the current evidence and further rcts should be conducted both of these factors should be clarified in future studiesconclusioncompared to a control treatment ntg can be beneficial to patients by reducing the rates of mfn debridement and additional early complications in ibr or mastectomy alone meanwhile ntg did not increase the incidence of drugrelated side effects relative to a control thus we believe that ntg could be recommended for wound healing after mastectomy especially when ibr is performedacknowledgementsthis work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 81772090author contributionsstudy

nipple ulceration and necrosis are rare and severe with the causes unclear objective this study aimed to investigate the risk factors for the development of nipple ulcers in the nipple retractor technique methods a retrospective study was conducted on inverted nipple patients between january 2012 and september 2021 clinical information including baseline patient demographics reproductive history smoking previous treatment nipple inversion grades nipple size areola size blood flow perfusion and ulcer development was collected results twentyfive female patients with 44 inverted nipples were enrolled nipple ulcers were present in seven patients four of whom were bilateral logistic regression analysis showed nipple inversion grades z  2105 or 7005 95 ci 114442898 p  0035 and relative perfusion of nipples z  2337 or 0969 95 ci 09440995 p  0019 were significantly associated with ulceration the structural equation model demonstrated the interaction of related factors nipple inversion grades increased by 0411 points for ulcers p  0004 while relative perfusion of nipples decreased by 0647 points for ulcers p  0001 conclusion preoperative nipple inversion severity and postoperative
