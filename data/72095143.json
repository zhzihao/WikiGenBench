passes away at 71 share share this story to twitter share this story to facebook share this story to linkedin 22092022 the longserving pga professional at cowal golf club on the west coast of scotland was a mighty figure on the domestic scene while his regular dashes back from events to catch the last ferry home to his beloved dunoon burnished the weir legend his wider successes meanwhile included victories in the british and european club professionals championships as well as glory on the european senior tour in 2001 in just his sixth start on the over50s circuit having served notice of his talent back in 1968 when he landed the scottish boys championship as a teenage amateur weir would go on plunder over 100 wins as a pro on the tartan tour he topped the order of merit five times while his competitive longevity and consistency was underlined by eight successive playing appearances in the pga cup weir revelled in the cutandthrust of the biennial battle and his appointment as gbi captain for the 2011 and 2013 matches was richly deserved and warmly embraced this is the highest point in my career he said when he took up the reins in the 2013 match at slaley hall weir inspired his gbi team in the singles and they won the session 7 ½  2 ½ to grab a valiant 1313 draw weir would make over 30 appearances on the european  now dp world tour  with an eighth place finish in the 1988 scottish open being his best result at the top table three years later his assault on the european clubs professionals title in holland came to a painful end when his leg gave way it transpired that he had broken his tibia and fibula and weir required 10 months of recuperation a tremendous standard bearer for the pga and its values weir was made an honorary member of the association and his career of unwavering professionalism will be rightly cherished alan tait another former tartan tour no 1 said of weir one of the nicest chaps youll ever meet and arguably the best golfer ever to have played on the pga tartan tour total legend on and off the course craig ronald the former scottish pga champion added absolutely gutted to learn that a true legend of scottish golf a pga scotland hero has passed away russell weir was a true gentleman and a man i have lots to thank for alan white chairman of the pga said russell was the epitome of the pga professional he will be remembered as the best of the best as a player but he was also an excellent club professional retailer and coach an all round great pga professional and person david longmuir the manager of the pga in scotland added russell was one of the most respected and liked professionals in scotland and his name was synonymous with the tartan tour i first saw russell in the 1988 scottish open when i was working with tournament sponsors bells and from that point i became aware of his talent and ability he was a great contributor to the game in scotland categories the pga related for golf clubs view more for golf

first aussie on their tour they kept asking me about kangaroos  i got so sick of it i told them they used to deliver the mail which they carried in their pouches she said in a 2013 interviewbut people were so good to me and i made some fabulous friendslife on the pro tour had its moments such as the florida tournament where masters and lpga founder marilynn smith were shot at by a sniper while playing togetheri backed away from a shot because i had second thoughts about my alignment just as a shot rang out smith once wrotea 45 magnum bullet zipped past my head exactly where i had been standing it penetrated the ground inches from the scorekeepers footwe all hit the ground margie our caddies and the scorekeeper six or seven shots sprayed out over the golf courseeventually convinced by the tournament director to keep playing smith said she and masters were quivering as they somehow made the cutthe gunman was never caughtanother facet of tour life that was not dangerous but tiresome was american immigration lawevery six months masters would have to leave the us and returnthanks to a friendly immigration official she had met through her frequent travels masters challenged the rulesher immigrant visa petition eventually led to the matter of masters a 1969 precedent that had a profound impact on other professional athletes wanting to live and compete in the united statesa lot of other sportspeople including a very good tennis player were then able to come in under that category after that so i was quite proud of it she said in the 2013 interview with australian

the evian championship in évianlesbains france on sunday the 24yearold bounced back from two bogeys and a double bogey to birdie three of the last five holes to secure a onestroke victory over american sophia schubert at 17under a birdie putt at the last crowned henderson as the first canadian golfer male or female to win multiple titles adding to the maiden major she won as an 18yearold at the kpmg womens pga championship in 2016 her 12th victory on the lpga tour extends her lead as the most successful canadian golfer by wins laurent ciprianiap on a deciding day when just two shots separated henderson from the five players tied in third at 15under her even par71 marked her highest score after carding 64 64 68 across the opening three days it was definitely an interesting day  not the start that i wanted henderson said i stayed pretty patient as patient as i could under those circumstances the saying is that majors are won on the back nine on sunday so i just tried to keep that frame of mind and knew that i was still in it if i could have a solid back the world no 10 had carried a twostroke advantage into sunday but a slow start opened the door for a string of players to surge into contention schubert nudged ahead at the 12th but henderson clawed her way back to level the american ahead of the final hole disaster struck when her tee shot skewed into the trees as schubert made the green for birdie but the canadian once again recovered superbly to escape trouble and when schuberts putt excruciatingly rolled around the cup henderson was left with a 8foot birdie chance to avoid a playoff henderson made no mistake rolling home to claim victory before being showered in champagne and water by her fellow competitors and sister brittany who caddies for her laurent ciprianiap to be sitting here a twotime major championship is just an unreal feeling she told reporters in 2016 winning the first major changed my life my world ranking shot up and i just received a ton more attention from fans and media it also made me feel like i really belonged out here and that i could contend for big major championships and compete against the best in the world which is an amazing feeling it has been a long time and getting off to a fast start early this week it just felt great to be at the top of the leaderboard at a major i just tried to take that excitement as far as i could her 1 million winners payout lifts her career earnings to 10237150 making her the 24th player in lpga tour history to pass the 10 million mark according to the lpga i want to cry tears of happiness after taking a short break from the game playing no lpga events in may the canadian has since won two events in four outings after victory at the shoprite lpga classic in june i worked a lot with my sister and also with my dad whos my coach henderson said and time with my mom back home it just really helped gain some perspective and put my head in the right place so i could come back out on tour and compete im just really excited for what the rest of the season holds she added for schubert us womens amateur champion in 2017 it was an agonizing end to what had been a hugely impressive performance in just her second major as a professional the 586262 prize pot the 26yearold takes home for her runnerup finish is just over seven times the 82796 she accumulated from her 11 previous

signature shot and some guts at the endfitzpatrick and zalatoris were tied going to the 15th when the englishman hit his tee shot so far right that it went into the gallery and found a decent lie on

with mcilroy holding its biggest prizehe had the final say with his clubssix shots behind before the tour championship started 10 shots back after two holes mcilroy rallied from a sixshot deficit in

guess every chance i get im trying to defend what i feel is the best place to play elite professional golf in the worldits in some ways fitting that i was able to get this done today to sort of round off a year that has been very very challenging and differentit came at the expense of masters champion scottie scheffler the no 1 player in the world who birdied four of six holes sunday morning to finish the stormdelayed third round at 66 and build a sixshot lead not even mcilroy who birdied the last two holes in the morning to get into the final group thought he had a great chancebut then scheffler never regained his groove missing fairways and greens and par putts he made only one birdie in a closing round of 73 and tied the pga tour record for losing a sixshot lead in the final roundi just didnt get off to a good start early but after that i grinded as hard as i could scheffler said for whatever reason my swing wasnt where it had been the first few days this weekmcilroy had

tie for the leadafter he flew the green by some 20 yards his pitch was running fast and headed off the front of the green when it hit the pin and settled 7 feet away he saved par scheffler blasted out

believe in something i think you have to speak up and i believe very strongly about this i really do mcilroy said i hate what its doing to the game of golf i hate iti think when you believe that what
