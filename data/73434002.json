It took place during Labor Day weekend on September 3, 2023, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, breaking its tradition of All Out taking place at the Now Arena, located in the Chicago metro area—not including the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic that year.\n\nThirteen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Zero Hour pre-show. In the main event, Jon Moxley defeated Orange Cassidy to win the AEW International Championship. In other prominent matches, Konosuke Takeshita defeated Kenny Omega, Luchasaurus defeated Darby Allin to retain the AEW TNT Championship, and Bryan Danielson defeated Ricky Starks in a No Disqualification Strap match. All Out was also notable for an appearance by C.J. Perry (formerly known as Lana in WWE) in what was her first professional wrestling appearance since 2021. This was also the first All Out in which the AEW World Championship was not defended, although the reigning champion, MJF, did perform on the event.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nAll Out is a pay-per-view (PPV) held annually during Labor Day weekend by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) since 2019. It is one of AEW's \"Big Four\" PPVs, which also includes Double or Nothing, Full Gear, and Revolution, their four biggest shows produced quarterly. During the Forbidden Door PPV on June 25, 2023, AEW announced that the fifth All Out event would take place on September 3 at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, breaking its previous tradition of being held at the Now Arena, located in the Chicago suburb of Hoffman Estates, Illinois—not including the 2020 event due to the COVID-19 pandemic that year. Additionally as part of All Out week, it was revealed that AEW's weekly television programs, Wednesday Night Dynamite and Friday Night Rampage, would be held at the Now Arena on August 30, with Dynamite airing live that night and Rampage airing on tape delay on September 1, and then Saturday Collision airing live from the United Center on September 2 the night before All Out. Tickets for all the events went on sale on July 14.\n\nStorylines\nAll Out featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite, Collision, and Rampage.\n\nOn July 21 at Rampage: Royal Rampage, Darby Allin won the Royal Rampage Battle Royal to earn an AEW TNT Championship match against Luchasaurus at All Out.\n\nOn the August 12 episode of Collision, Powerhouse Hobbs said the next chapter of his book would be labeled \"redemption\". He then called out \"The Redeemer\", Miro, who came out but was attacked by Nick Comoroto and Aaron Solo. Miro cleared Comoroto and Solo from the ring, but then Hobbs put him down with a spinebuster and dropped his book on Miro's chest. The following week at Collision: Fight for the Fallen, after Hobbs' match, Miro appeared on the big screen and taunted Hobbs over his book. Later, a match between Miro and Hobbs was announced for All Out. During the All In Zero Hour pre-show, they signed the contract for the match, which ended in a brawl.\n\nDuring Dynamite: Fyter Fest on August 23, Ruby Soho warned Kris Statlander that she would be going after her and the AEW TBS Championship. During that same week's Rampage: Fyter Fest, Statlander attacked Soho. The following night on Collision: Fyter Fest, Soho officially challenged Statlander for the TBS Championship at All Out, which Statlander accepted.\n\nAt All In, Konosuke Takeshita pinned Kenny Omega in a six-man tag team match to give his team the victory. During the All In media scrum, after Don Callis requested the bout, AEW president Tony Khan announced that Omega would face Takeshita at All Out.\n\nFor weeks, Orange Cassidy had been involved in feuds with the Blackpool Combat Club (Jon Moxley, Claudio Castagnoli, and Wheeler Yuta). On August 16 during Dynamite: Fight for the Fallen, he retained the AEW International Championship against Yuta. At All In just over a week later, he scored the win for his team in the Stadium Stampede match by pinning Castagnoli. During the All In post-event media scrum, Cassidy said that with pins over both Yuta and Castagnoli, he now wanted to pin Moxley next. It was then announced that if Cassidy retained the International Championship on the August 30 episode of Dynamite, he would get his chance to face Moxley in a title defense at All Out. Cassidy retained, thus officially scheduling the match.\n\nOn the August 5 episode of Collision, Ricky Starks challenged CM Punk for the \"Real World Championship\", with Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat serving as the special outside enforcer due to Stark cheating his way to defeat Punk in their prior two matches, including the finals of the Owen Hart Cup. After the match, Starks assaulted Steamboat with the latter's own belt. As a result of his actions against Steamboat, AEW (kayfabe) suspended Starks for 28 days. However, Starks acquired a manager's license in order to continue appearing in AEW. On August 30, Tony Khan announced that on the September 2 episode, Starks would issue a challenge to Steamboat for a strap match at All Out. There, Starks signed a match contract for the bout against Steamboat. However, as the contract just said \"The Dragon\", \"The American Dragon\" Bryan Danielson then made his return from injury and signed the contract instead of Steamboat, thus scheduling Starks to face Danielson in the strap match at All Out.\n\nEvent\n\nPre-show\nThere were three matches contested on the pre-show.

lethal with sojay dutt and nick wayne 1 the royal rampage for a shot at the tnt championship allin and lethal started in the ring with red ropes that was closest to the stage which ill label the first ring swerve and wayne fought in the second ring which had blue ropes jericho noted that all four wrestlers were from the seattle area and had competed in the defy promotion no 5 was minoru suzuki who entered the ring with lethal and allin lethal talked suzuki into doubling up on allin no 6 was brian cage who entered the ring with wayne and swerve cage worked over wayne and hugged swerve meanwhile lethal and suzukis alliance fell apart no 7 was ethan page who went right after lethal and ended up trading blows with suzuki no 8 was komander who was accompanied by alex abrahantes komander went to the second ring and jumped off of cages shoulders and then ddtd swerve on the way down komander also worked over cage no 9 was the butcher who entered the first ring and clotheslined page no 10 was big bill who joined the action in the second ring and attacked wayne and komander bill put wayne down with a big boot and then hit a blackhole slam on komander in the first ring page eliminated lethal who then grabbed the hand of page suzuki helped push page over the top rope while lethal pulled him to the floor to eliminate him moments later butcher stuffed suzukis gotch style piledriver attempt and eliminated him from the match no 11 was the blade who joined the butcher in double teaming allin at ringside as the show cut to a pictureinpicture break no 12 was brother zay isiah kassidy who entered the second ring with a springboard crossbody block on swerve no 13 was toa liona who was in ring one excalibur said things just went from bad to worse for allin who was being roughed up by butcher and blade liona grabbed allins arms and then butcher grabbed his feet and they swung him into a corner of the ring no 14 was matt sydal excalibur recalled sydal being the joker in a casino battle royale sydal had a bad slip and would probably like to forget that match sydal and kassidy teamed up for gin  juice on swerve no 15 was bishop kaun who went right after butcher and blade because they had already turned on liona in ring two kassidy took a powerbombclothesline combo move from cage and bill cage tossed kassidy over the top rope to eliminate him in ring one liona and kaun booted butcher and blade from the apron to eliminate them no 16 was matt hardy who went after swerve in the second ring hardy followed up with a neckbreaker on cage and followed up with a clunky ddt on bill no 17 was matt menard who was cautious about entering the first ring where kaun and liona had allin down meanwhile cage eliminated sydal from the second ring menard entered the ring and teased going after the gates of agony duo but turned and put the boots to allin no 18 was jeff jarrett who brought out a guitar and was accompanied by karen jarrett and satnam singh jarrett went right after hardy no 19 was angelo parker the final entrant in the first ring parker went after kaun and liona but he was quickly cut off no 20 was jake hager who was the final entrant in the second ring hager shot jericho a look before heading to the ring as the show cut to a pip break during the break hager took a suplex from cage bill shoved hager against the ropes and then komander helped shoved hager over the top to eliminate him bill eliminated komander moments later all four heels set up for a move on allin in the first ring coming out of the break but he slipped away the heel teams started fighting near the ropes and allin crashed into them but none were eliminated initially kaun and liona finally eliminated parker and menard in the second ring hardy eliminated jarrett cage and swerve performed a double team move on hardy and then bill clotheslined hardy over the top rope to eliminate him bill tried to chokeslam wayne but wayne stayed on the apron swerve ran over and pushed bill over the top rope to eliminate him wayne climbed to the top rope of the first ring and performed a splitlegged dropkick on kaun and liona wayne followed up with waynes world on kaun allin and wayne clotheslined kaun over the top rope to eliminate him wayne returned to the second ring wayne was backdropped onto the apron by cage who went for a clothesline and tumbled over the top to the apron when wayne ducked it swerve went for a big boot that wayne ducked and cage caught wayne tried to shove both heels to the floor but swerve held on while cage was eliminated swerve caught wayne leaping from the ropes and dumped him face first onto the turnbuckle so that he landed on the apron swerve wrenched waynes arm over the top rope and then wayne fell off the apron and was eliminated meanwhile liona charged allin who ducked and held the top rope down causing liona to go over the top rope to the floor the final two were allin and swerve with allin down swerve entered the first ring and delivered a kick to the back of allins head swerve jawed at allin and then ran the ropes but allin sent him over the top rope swerve skinned the cat allin tried to pry his fingers from the ropes nana entered the ring and hit allin with his skateboard allin went after nana but swerve returned to the ring and attacked allin from behind jericho asked how this was legal and then schiavone said anything goes in a battle royal ugh nana set the skateboard so that its wheels were facing upward and then swerve powerbombed allin whose back landed on the front wheels good lord swerve tossed allin over the top rope but allin held on to the top rope swerve went up top and jumped toward allin who put his boots up only for swerve to stop short of his feet swerve went for a brainbuster but allin slipped away and wrenched swerves neck over the top rope allin ran the ropes and performed a suicide dive that drove swerve off the apron and caused both men to the ring floor at ringside allins music played darby allin won the royal rampage to earn a shot at the tnt championship a replay showed that swerves feet hit the ground before allin landed on the floor powells pov i didnt have my hopes up for the royal rampage but i actually thought this was a fun match big bill gates of agony and nick wayne stood out in addition to the final two of allin and swerve poor swerve continues to come off like hes always the bridesmaid and never the bride that said i really liked the suicide dive finish because it fits with allin throwing caution to the wind conversely that skateboard bump that he took was brutal i also could have done without nana getting involved it felt odd that heel jericho wondered why it was allowed while nice guy schiavone was the one who justified by saying everything is legal the acclaimed made their entrance for the sixman tag match while their opponents were already inside the ring max caster rapped on his way to the ring and labeled harley cameron a reject from the barbie movie he said she turned johnny tv into johnny gonorrhea 2 billy gunn and the acclaimed max caster and anthony bowens vs johnny tv qt marshall and aaron solo wharley cameron there was a loud qt sucks chant as the match started marshall had a large bandage on his back that stemmed from his match with pentagon jr in mexico marshall still took the bulk of the bumps for his team heading into a pip break the heel trio took out caster and bowens on the floor in the ring tv hit a springboard kick on gunn and then marshall dropped him with a diamond cutter solo performed a top rope double stomp on gunn tv covered gunn for a good near fall they set up for the scissor me timbers spot on gunn but caster and bowens returned to break it up gunn caught solo leaping from the ropes and gave him a cobra clutch slam bowens hit solo with the arrival and then caster landed the mic drop gunn covered solo and got the three count billy gunn and the acclaimed max caster and anthony bowens defeated johnny tv qt marshall and aaron solo after the match caster took the mic and said they would rise to the top of the trios division on saturdays aew collision powells pov this was fine for what it was the heel near fall would have been much more believable if gunn and the acclaimed werent challenging for the aew trios titles on collision excalibur announced the following for saturdays

said the main event was an open challenge and the time limit was television time remaining nyla rose came out with marina shafir but she did not accompany her to the ring kris statlander was out next 3 kris statlander vs marina shafir for the tbs championship excalibur ran through the dynamite lineup see the main page shafir took offensive control and performed a side suplex shafir covered statlander who kicked out at one shafir pressed her barefoot on the face of statlander which got some boos statlander took a series of kicks and then fired up and caught the leg of shafir before firing back with punches statlander powered up shafir in electric chair position and dropped her face first to the mat a short time later statlander powered up shafir and suplex her and then covered her for a two count statlander set up shafir for a move but shafir slipped out and applied a standing figure four statlander kicked her way free and then avoided a big kick statlander put shafir down with a discus lariat and then hit the friday night fever inverted piledriver and scored the pin kris statlander defeated marina shafir to retain the tbs championship statlander looked into the camera while doing sign language while excalibur closed the show with a plug for collision powells pov a good episode of rampage the royal rampage match made the show feel more important than usual and filled a lot of time in an entertaining way the other two matches were quick harmless and showcased popular babyface acts i suspect the last two matches were edited for time purposes they seemed to be showing more replays than usual during the final match and those could have been easy edit points either way they could easily fill the full hour with the royal rampage in future years by either

episode 107 taped august 19 2023 in lexington kentucky at rupp arena aired august 25 2023 on tnt a memorial graphic aired in memory of windham rotunda aka bray wyatt dons takeits been a rough week for wrestling fans my sincerest condolences to the families friends and fans of both bray wyatt and terry funk the rampage opening aired and pyro shot off from the stage excalibur and tony schiavone were on commentary 1 orange cassidy vs aaron solo wharley cameron for the aew international championshipboth participants received televised entrances the match started off with a nice sequence of chain wrestling by both cassidy and solo eventually action spilled to the floor and there was a fun spot where cassidy hit cameron with a series of light shin kicks which she sold really well cassidy threw solo back in the ring and attempted to climb the ropes only to be tripped up by cameron which gave solo the upper hand heading into the picturein picture break coming out of the commercial solo maintained the advantage cassidy eventually regained momentum after solo missed a move in the corner cassidy gained two near falls on solo after hitting stun dog millionaire and a ddt the finish saw cameron distract cassidy with her singing which allowed solo to hit cassidy with a spin kick and a modified suplex where he dropped him on his shoulder for a near fall solo followed up with a double stomp off the top rope for another near fall after both wrestlers got back on their feet solo distracted the referee while cameron attempted to hit cassidy with her boot the referee caught her and began ushering her out of the ring this allowed solo to hit cassidy with the boot for a near fall after exchanging rollup attempts cassidy hit solo with the orange punch and his beach break finisher for the win orange cassidy defeated aaron solo to retain the aew international championship dons take i enjoyed this match for what it was it didnt do much in terms of storyline advancement or building to either of the upcoming payperviews but it continued to tell the story of cassidy as the fighting champion i also think theres some untapped potential in both solo and cassidy their involvement in the qtv faction isnt hitting the mark but with some more reps they will hopefully be able to find something that clicks speaking of qtv we went to jim ross who was with qt marshall ross congratulated marshall on winning the aaa latin american championship marshall spoke about the lack of respect he has received noting that many within aew felt that he received opportunities because of who he associated with and because of his relationship with tony khan marshall questioned that theory by asking if that was the case why he had to go to another country to win a title he touched on his professionalism both in and out of the ring but noted that despite this hes seen as an afterthought he exclaimed that his own mother can go online and buy 150000 excalibur figures but cannot buy one of him because they dont exist he promised to get the respect he deserves by defending his new title later in the show excalibur and tony plugged the all out payperview in chicago including their daily fantasy sports partnership 2 qt marshall wjohnny tv vs gravity for the aaa latin american championship marshall took the mic and spoke a combination of spanish and english he wished gravity luck and noted that bandido was his brother and was a better wrestler he then instructed gravity to leave and johnny sang the na na na goodbye song gravity slapped marshall and the match began johnny joined the announcers on commentary the first part of the match saw gravity hit a series of high flying moves with marshall attempting a groundbased attack going into commercial marshall hit a powerbomb on the ring apron after the break gravity gained a series of near falls with several rollups an impressive looking destroyer and a samoan drop from the top rope the announcers highlighted gravitys speed and youth going up against marshalls strength and experience the finish saw marshall convert a backdrop into a cutter followed by a powerbomb for the win qt marshall defeated gravity to retain the aaa latin american championship dons take another fun match and furthers my case that moving away from the nonsense of the qtv faction the individual members could bring something to the table marshall attempting to come off latin american gave me a chuckle and took me back to the days of dlo brown as wwe european champion gravity does some flashy moves and much like many other aew wrestlers would benefit from a story and some character development a dark order promo aired they spoke about how theyve been wronged in the past and how their match against vinny marseglia dutch and stu grayson at roh death before dishonor opened their violent side evil uno ended by saying be selfish be happy be the dark order 3 tnt champion luchasaurus vs ren jones in a nontitle match christian cage did not accompany luchasaurus to ringside but was shown looking on from the back on the monitor this was a complete squash match with luchasuarus chokeslamming jones and hitting him with a clothesline to the back of the head luchasaurus defeated ren jones dons takea basic squash match heading into the two payperviews the clock is ticking on when luchasaurus has finally had enough of christian but hopefully thats a long way off as the dynamic between them continues to be entertaining ads aired for the upcoming all in event this sunday from wembley stadium after the break excalibur sped through the lineups for collision and allin as well as the initial matches signed for all out darby allin vs luchasaurus and powerhouse hobbs vs miro mark henry hyped the main event 4 toni storm and saraya wruby soho vs dr britt baker and hikaru shida the match started with all four women brawling the heels gained the advantage and isolated baker after throwing baker to the outside soho joined in on the attack but was stopped by aew tbs champion kris statlander who put soho in a firemans carry and carried her to the back after the commercial the heels continued the attack on baker after hitting a sling blade baker eventually made the hot tag to shida after shida cleaned house for several minutes all four women ended up battling in the ring the finish saw storm spray shida with the spray paint in her blinded state shida hit baker which allowed saraya to hit baker with her nightcap finisher for the win toni storm and saraya defeated dr britt baker and hikaru shida after the match the heels celebrated by both holding up the aew womens championship simultaneously as the show went off the air dons takethis was a solid main event and planted the seeds of dissension between the babyfaces heading into their match at all in there was no dissension among the outcasts but i suspect that to surface on sunday particularly with saraya being the hometown favorite i continue to enjoy toni storms evolution as a heel character and feel like shes finally on to something for a show just under a week old i thought this was an enjoyable way to head into the big show this weekend there wasnt much storyline development but the wrestling was fine for what it was and it showed some small hints of potential among some of the undercard acts that are hopefully given time to develop

liljohnm aew collision episode 11 taped august 23 2023 in duluth georgia at gas south arena aired august 26 2023 on tnt the collison opening aired kevin kelly and caprice coleman were on commentary caprice filling in for nigel mcguinness dasha gonzalez was the ring announcer ftw champion jack perry made his entrance he had four extras carry out the ftw belt on a platform like it was at a funeral service the ring was set up to look like a funeral for the ftw title perry soaked in you suck chants for a bit he took the mic and said these things are never easy perry said that as the greatest ftw champion in history he felt obligated to say nice words about the title perry said it was a good title that was misunderstood at times he said the title has grown near and dear to his heart because when people look up the history of the ftw title his face will be next to it perry told the production truck to air a montage of all the good times of the ftw title a slideshow aired of jack perry spending everyday moments with the title belt doing things like hanging out at the pool hanging out in the neighborhood and even taking a shower perry said it was time to send the ftw title to a better place perry grabbed a sledgehammer from under the table the lights went out a video aired of hook doing pullups on a street light hook said hell be returning to take whats his back at the arena hook was already behind perry hook tossed perry around the inring funeral set hook set up a table in the corner and gave perry a tbone suplex through it hook laid the ftw title over the unconscious perry hook took the mic and simply said wembley sunday the hyped up the jack perry vs jack perry for all in a recap package aired to recap the adam cole and mjf bromance saga leading to their two matches at all in johns thoughts simple and effective segment to quickly set up the hook vs perry match at wembley i would prefer more meaningful builds but hooks character being a simple and effective badass works with the simple build perry continues to show growth as a talker hes not totally primetime yet but as a heel hes able to develop by getting out of his comfort zone by the way im filling in for jason powell on live coverage this week the babyfaces got a televised entrance the heels were already in the ring for some reason they took a lot of time before the bell for pentagon to do his cero miedo things 1 orange cassidy penta el cero miedo walex abrahantes and eddie kingston vs the butcher the blade and kip sabian wthe bunny penelope ford the brawl spilled to outside butcher and blade took down kingston with a double team lariat pentagon kicked butcher into the corner and gave blade a death valley driver into him sabian pulled penta crotch first into the ringpost sabian and orange traded rollups orange took a boot and double team sidewalk slam from butcher and blade kip got a two count both kip and orange traded quick counters kip hit orange with an inverted cannonball blade tagged in and hit orange with a lightning spiral the show cut to pictureinpicture back from the break the heels cut the ring in half on orange also making sure to trip the babyfaces from the apron orange managed to fend off the heels and bring in pentagon for the hot tag penta gave out slingblades pentagon hit kip with a canadian destroyer butcher asked for it and got it kingston tagged in eddie and butcher canceled each other out with lariats butcher called for a power bomb but ate an enzuigiri eddie gave kip a series of elbows and a corner lariat eddie gave kip and blade machine gun chops in the corner kip sabian was swarmed eddie gave kip an exploder pentagon gave kip a michinoku driver orange gave kip an orange punch during the driver kingston gave kip a sliding lariat for the win eddie kingston orange cassidy and penta el cero miedo defeated kip sabian the butcher and the blade via pinfall in 938 the commentary team hyped up stadium stampede for all in johns thoughts a good match to showcase some of the babyfaces in the stadium stampede match not a huge fan of the already in the ring approach by the heels as it allows the viewers to tune away since they know the match is a foregone conclusion butcher blade and kip are glorified enhancement which added more to the feeling that this was a miscible match chuck taylor and trent barretta joined the babyfaces from the prior match the best friends called out blackpool combat club for breaking trents moms van trent said that at stadium stampede they arent going to hug and have fun trent said their team is coming to hurt the bcc and are doing it for sue eddie teased a promo but orange cassidy took the mic from him before he could speak the blackpool combat club santana and ortiz appeared on teh big screen jon moxley talked about how eddie made the stadium stampede challenge and gave bcc a choice of any tag partners santana said hes gone through a year of pain struggle and trouble he said that allowed him to see who was real or not santana said it all culminates at wembley stadium eddie kingston exited the ring and marched to the back while claudio started to speak claudio talked about how eddie kingston betrays everyone and might even betray his current team claudio said eddie is a hypocrite that blames everyone else but himself ortiz said a wise man once said you reap what you sow the camera cut to eddie kingston looking for the bcc backstage he was tossing around backstage equipment eddie then got up to the camera and said that hes not surprised that santana and ortiz turned to the dark side he said thats not going to change the fact that hes going to gut them and watch them die eddie asked mox to get out of his way he said that mox as a beautiful wife and child at home eddie said hes going to bury yuta eddie then said that claudio is his sweetheart and hes going to burn and scar claudio eddie kissed the camera and walked off johns thoughts there were no bad performances here but it felt a bit crowded due to all the players in stadium stampede part of what hurt the segment is the fact that they had to reshuffle things thus leading to an extremely underwhelming return of the old lax duo who are money on the mic when you give them time the best promo from all the players here was eddie kingston once he went backstage and was able to put a target on each of his stadium stampede opponents it also reminds viewers that he has a soft spot for jon moxley the show cut to sitdown interviews with ftr and the young bucks the first part was the bucks talking about how cody rhodes came up with the ftr name which stood for fck the revival dax talked about how that annoyed him dax talked about how ftr being the best tag team in the world bothers the bucks both teams went on to sell their upcoming match at wembley as huge entrances for the next match took place kevin kelly made sure to plug the early start time of all in due to it being in london 2 the dark order alex reynolds and john silver vs darius martin and action andretti silver and action started the match with chain wrestling silver managed to send action into the corner to bring in reynolds to dominate action action managed to get in darius darius and action gave reynolds alternating strikes they gave reynolds a double suplex and gave silver stereo dropkicks silver managed to blind tag in so he could power bomb action onto the knees of reynolds for the two count silver and reynolds used quick tags to maintain a numbers advantage over action action managed to use a judo roll to tag in darius darius rallied with right hands on both opponents darius hit both opponents with ddts at the same time darius got a two count off reynolds action tagged in and helped knock down both opponents darius gave reynolds a brainbuster action gave reynolds a slingshot 450 silver broke up actions pin silver took down both opponents with kicks action came back with a kick on silver reynolds popped up action into silvers uppercut darius tried to fend off the dark order with right hands and corner splashes slver and reynolds caught darius with alternating strikes silver hit darius with a german suplex which allowed reynolds to hit him with a jackknife pin for the win the dark order defeated darius martin and action andretti via pinfall in 836 johns thoughts well wrestled match but this was ten or so minutes that could have been used to hype up all in on sunday strange to put a random ring of honor match here they could have cancelled this match and found a way to make the previous stadium stampede promo seem less compacted the show cut to lexi nair interviewing nick wayne and darby allin about his thoughts on christian cage daring wayne not to come to all in ar fox cut in and apologized to nick wayne he said it took him 16 years to make it to aew fox said he panicked because he thought everyone lost faith in him after he lost to orange cassidy he said he lost his father too fox held out his hand for a handshake to say he has waynes back but wayne walked past him darby accepted the handshake and said he understands that fox is sorry the show cut to a skit and rap video featuring the acclaimed training with daddy ass billy gunn this was to hype their match against house of black on sunday a hype video aired for the womens championship fatal four way title match on sunday big bill got a televised entrance enhancement victim vary morales was already in the ring 3 big bill wricky starks vs vary morales morales tried to start quick out the gate but quickly got dragged into a press slam by big bill bill swung vary around by the hair bill hit vary with a stinger splash big bill floored vary with a big boot big bill hit vary with a delayed chokeslam for the victory big bill defeated vary morales via pinfall in 139 ricky starks mocked vary by saying that vary reminds him of a young ricky steamboat and hes about to do the same thing he did to steamboat ricky hit vary a few times with the belt he said hes not feeling it now and next week hell have a bigger strap ricky said for now this will do pig ricky continued to whip vary with the belt the refs ran off to shoo off ricky and bill ricky mocked the referees before leaving johns thoughts simple and effective match to give big bill a win and starks more heat i hope this means that big bill is in line for a big push after these fodder wins but unfortunately i think theyre just setting up big bill to be a gatekeeper for cm punk to get to ricky starks lexi nair interviewed ruby soho about crossing paths with tbs champion kris statlander soho got in the camera and talked about how she challenged statlander to a match at all out next week ruby ended her promo by saying kris says shes more than a woman but shell always be less than an outcast willow nightingale got a televised entrance coleman did a good freestyle rap to willows theme the renegade twins were already at the ring with robyn being the one wrestling 4 willow nightingale vs robyn renegade wcharlotte renegade robyn managed to give willow a headlock and noogie willow powered out robyn gave willow a drop toehold into the 2nd buckle willow took down robyn with an elbow and basement crossbody for a nearfall willow hit robyn with two of three amigos willow recovered and hit robyn with a fisherman suplex for a two count robyn tried to stall at ringside willow gave charlotte a pk from the apron robyn tripped up willow on the apron the show cut to pictureinpicture willow rallied with axe handles strikes and corner moves willow planted robyn with a spinebuster for a two count mercedes martinez and diamante were watching the match from the back willow missed a corner cannonball robyn hit willow with a missile dropkick for a nearfall robyn sent willow to ringside with a yakuza kick charlotte teased hitting willow with a double team suplex for some reason willow hit both twins with a suplex at the same time willow hit robyn with the doctor bomb for the win willow nightingale defeated robyn renegade via pinfall in 835 an all in plug aired focusing on the media attention aew is getting in the uk johns thoughts again good match but aew has two ppvs coming up with two consecutive weeks does aew have time to put filler matches on collision or dynamite dynamite was very good and efficient this week at hype why are we getting collisionverse matches on collision not any ppv hype it also doesnt help that the viewer is encouraged that this match is meaningless due to the already in the ring treatment of the enhancement fodder the jobber from the big bill match was the one where already in the ring makes sense by the way why isnt willow nightingale on the all in card shes so charismatic and i can see her firing up that huge stadium crowd a hype package aired to hype miro vs powerhouse hobbs at all out lexi nair interviewed kris statlander about ruby sohos challenge kris talked about how shes sick of the outcasts she said they are acting like children she said if ruby is going to act like a child mamas going to treat her like one kris said shes going to put ruby in time out kris said shes sick of being stepped on and disrespected kris accepted rubys challenge for all out keith lee got a televised entrance zicky dice was already in the ring 5 keith lee vs zicky dicedice did a hip swivel lee led the crowd in a bask in his glory chant dice yelled that hes outlandish keith came at dice with a stiff lariat dice rallied back with right forearms lee came back with a pounce lee hit dice with the spirit bomb for the victory keith lee defeated zicky dice via pinfall in 135 johns thoughts simple and effective squash same thing i said about the big bill match this is effective character development as opposed to some of the weird filler matches they decide to throw on collision hope this counts though because every time keith lee pops up he randomly disappears meanwhile dice is coming fresh off his impact wrestling run where he was a comedy wrestler for most of his time there the show cut to a cinematic where dralistico and preston vance had bags on their heads and were getting beat up by random thugs they eventually got up and fought off the thugs a person was shown clapping in the distance presumably jose the assistant a to be continued graphic aired ring of honor champion samoa joe made his entrance in street clothes jim ross joined the commentary team samoa joe introduced himself as the king of television joe talked about how he was told that if he interfered in the upcoming collision match he would put his all in opportunity in jeopardy joe talked about how being at ringside is smart since everyone can keep their eyes on him joe was angry at the sneak attack from punk last week where he was in a golden bodysuit joe said hes going to be a professional joe said hes a man thats satisfied got what he needs and got the match he wanted against cm punk joe said hell hand punk the ass whooping he needs kevin kelly ran through the advertised all in card a hype package aired for samoa joe vs cm punk at all in kevin kelly ran through the few matches advertised for all out samoa joe joined the commentary team the babyfaces in the main event made their entrance bullet club made their entrance first christian cage was out next 6 cm punk darby allin sting and hook vs jay white swerve strickland luchasaurus wchristian cage and brian cage wprince nana strickland and punk squared each other up early on punk got a hammerlock on strickland strickland pressured punk to the corner to break the hold strickland managed to wiggle his way to a headscissors punk caught strickland and went for a gts but swerve escaped and tagged in white punk and white took time soaking in cheers and boos white demanded that sting enter the ring when punk went for the tag white clubbed punk in the back white rallied with chops punk came back with chops of his own white dropkicked the calf of punk punk recovered and came back with a back suplex hook tagged in and worked on white with gut punches hook used a akido takedown on white darby tagged in and continued the wrist manipulation punk tagged in to continue the wrist manipulation white rolled away when sting was about to tag in darby and luchasaurus tagged in luchasaurus caught darby off the springboard but sting blind tagged in and saved darby sting and darby gave luchasaurus alternating corner splashes punk went for a stinger splash but walked right into a choke christian tripped punk which allowed luchasaurus to catch punk with a big boot heading into pictureinpicture the heels cut the ring in half on cm punk with tags punk got a window of opportunity after swerve missed a double stomp this allowed hook to get the hot tag hook hit swerve with a nice judo toss and gut punches hook hit swerve with a northern lights suplex swerve blindsided hook after a distraction from white hook was tossed into the barricade hook beat the ten count brian cage tagged in and put the boots to hook the show cut back to pictureinpicture the heels continued to cut the ring in half on hook hook hit cage with a t bone suplex for a window of opportunity cage recovered and knocked sting and darby off the apron hook hit cage with another suplex hook gave punk the hot tag leading to a mixed reaction punk cleaned house punk fed into the mixed reaction by cupping his ear punk took down white and swerve with running moves punk hit white with a body slam to soak more mixed reaction punk hit white with an elbow drop white distracted the referee which allowed swerve to nail punk with a flatliner the wrestlers took turns hitting signature moves on each other once things settled a bit cage hit darby with a release f5 punk hit cage with a gts punk put cage in the coquina clutch for the submission win cm punk darby allin sting and hook defeated brian cage jay white swerve strickland and luchasaurus vis submission in 2107 joe asked the announce team if he could attack punk now that the match is finished they said yes punk stormed the ring and worked on punk with a flurry of strikes jack perry ran out to brawl with hook sting and darby double teamed swerve an overall brawl ensued as the commentary team plugged all in hook and perry managed to end up in the crowd joe hit punk in the head with the real world title darby teased going after joe but joe backed down up the ramp kevin kelly closed the show as the show cut right into the countdown to all in show johns thoughts a good teaser match to allow some of the all in competitors to preview their all in matches while it didnt add layers to any of the existing feuds it did serve as a good tease for the all in show we needed more stuff like this tonight as opposed to some of the filler matches we got on the all in go home show tonight thing that stood out as a glaring positive was samoa joe on commentary joe has had his long stint as the color voice of raw and it showed here that allowed him to do a good job hyping up his match against punk aew collision continues to be a wellpaced show the format of this show would improve dynamite by a lot where collision suffers is the weird filler matches we get last week we got matches involving bear country and kevin ku this week we got several matches following the already in the ring formula for squashes already in the ring works for competitive matches it just gives the viewer an excuse to change the channel because there is no drama to the outcome what confused me this week was they followed that flawed logic during the go home show to all in listen to pro wrestling boom podcast on spreaker we value your privacy privacy policy info here topicsaewaew

opened the show with highlights from the wembley stadium show that took place this past sunday excalibur made announcements that orange cassidy would defend against penta el zero miedo adam cole will speak chris jericho would be heard from and jon moxley will face komander the rest of the announce team of taz and tony schiavone checked in at the booth jon moxley made his entrance through the crowd he was followed by komander 1 jon moxley vs komander moxley landed a big boot and some chops to start he then stepped on komanders neck near the ropes and taunted him komander fired back with some kicks and a tijeras to send moxley to the floor he then followed up with a big splash from the top komander went back up top but moxley recovered and met him there mox raked his back with his nails but komander knocked moxley down with a headbutt komander attempted a cancun tornado but moxley moved and landed a release vertical suplex moxley dominated the commercial break and landed some palm strikes as the show returned komander hit the ropes and landed a kick that rocked moxley he then landed a low dropkick and followed up with a lungblower for a near fall komander attempted to walk the ropes and land a splash and mox got his knees up he then followed up with a big lariat and a piledriver for a close near fall mox followed up with 12 to 6 elbows and applied a rear naked sleeper he then transitioned into a juji gatame and got the win jon moxley defeated komander at 843 after the match moxley celebrated with the crowd and returned to the back the way he walked in excalibur then introduced a video package for orange cassidy where he spoke about his desire to continue defending the aew international championship wherever and whenever he has to he addressed jon moxley and said hes not the same orange cassidy he was four years ago and he would show him why excalibur then introduced footage of the young bucks backstage after their match at all in and they expressed their disappointment ftr walked into the room and asked why they disrespected them matt said it was supposed to go different because it was the show they started and in the heat of the moment he lost his cool he attempted to apologize but they were interrupted by bullet club gold who talked some trash about the elite and ftr being big losers they ended up agreeing to ftr and the young bucks vs bullet club gold at all out jericho will address the crowd up next my take a solid match to start the show moxley looks strong heading into his international title match at all out or at least as strong as you can get from a 5050 match with komander after a loss at the ppv the ftrbucks vs bullet club gold match seems less interesting than a potential return title match well see how it goes on sunday a video recap covered sarayas title win at wembley renee paquette interviewed toni storm backstage she complained about toni going off script and that she cant trust anyone and that wembley went tits up she started to walk away in distress and said she cant even trust her bloody shoes throwing them in renees direction and causing her to duck out of the way in the arena chris jericho made his entrance in a very shiny jacket split screen video as shown of his blowup with sammy guevara after his loss to will ospreay jericho said he should be happy being just a few days removed from the biggest weekend of his career he mentioned his fozzy show on friday the most attended wrestling show in history at wembley and one of his favorite matches with will ospreay but theres one thing hed like to forget and thats how he treated sammy guevara he invited him out so he could talk to him sammy guevara made his entrance and entered the ring jericho addressed sammy and said he wasnt happy about how he treated him he said he was frustrated with losing to ospreay and he shouldnt have taken it out of him jericho introduced some confusion by saying he wasnt sure if guevara did everything he could to help him win but then aired footage of sammy hitting ospreay with a baseball bat on sunday and then offered a full apology jericho said the match really bothered him and he wondered if he could have pulled his tights a little harder or guevara could have hit him a little harder with the bat guevara asked him to repeat himself and they began an argument guevara got chippy with him about having to be in london and abandon his pregnant wife in orlando jericho said he expected him to be grateful because thats something many people in the locker room would have killed for guevara replied that if he wasnt so focused on having jerichos back he would have wrestled on that show jericho replied that maybe if he followed more of his advice he could wrestle on the show next year guevara replied that he liked the sound of that but he wouldnt follow all of his advice so he could actually win on their biggest show jericho the brought up his loss to mjf and guevara brought up the incident where jericho lost the aew world title at a steakhouse in the end jericho decided they should stop throwing barbs at each other and do what they do best and reform le sex gods and go after the aew tag team championships guevara thought about it and reluctantly agreed backstage jon moxley made some brief comments about the aew international title match on sunday he said no matter who he faced after tonights main event the winner would be the one with the most bite wheeler yuta made his entrance in the arena followed by eddie kingston my take jericho and guevara had a good back and forth i guess they arent rushing into a match with them at all out which i thought was a possibility unfortunately that means that all out is severely lacking in marquis matchups heading into the weekend 2 eddie kingston vs wheeler yuta eddie kingston wore a bandage on his elbow and yuta targeted the bad elbow early on kingston absorbed a lot of abuse during the break but made a surge back as the show returned he landed a suicide dive on the floor and then a series of chops kingston landed an exploder suplex and covered for a near fall yuta recovered and attempted a top rope splash but kingston got the legs up eddie favored his elbow heavily and couldnt land a half and half suplex yuta landed a suplex of his own and covered for two he then landed a chop to kingstons chest kingston replied with his own yuta went back to the elbow but got caught with a half and half suplex coming off the ropes eddie landed a spinning backfist and yuta refused to go down eddie landed a second one and covered for the win eddie kingston defeated wheeler yuta at 901 after the match claudio castagnoli walked to the ring to retrieve yuta and refused to make eye contact at all with kingston the crowd chanted for kingston as he made his way out of the ring a video package recapped all in for mjf and adam cole mjf and cole were shown after their match mjf told cole he was taking the week off he said cole had him wrestling more than he had in his entire career the past few months he said he was going to paris to eat a baguette and bang some rats and then he would meet his in chicago for deep dish and theyd hit a double clothesline at all out mjf clarified that there would be a battle royal on rampage to determine who they would face at all out and a tournament to determine his challenger at the arthur ashe stadium show on september 20th cole said if anyone deserved a week off it was him and congratulated him my take a battle royal and a tournament tony khan cannot help himself kingston vs yuta was a solid tv match but i dont think the average fan is invested in the njpw strong openweight championships it really doesnt add anything in the form of stakes to this match aew crowds love them some eddie kingston regardless renee young interviewed sammy guevara backstage he started talking about being on the same page with jericho when don callis showed up he tried to schmooze with guevara who quickly told him to take his hands off of him and to get lost excalibur confirmed the roh tag title battle royal on rampage and the aew grand slam tournament starting next week adam cole made his entrance for a promo in the arena cole addressed the crowd and thanked them for the most memorable weekend of his career he said losing the title match hurt but he knew he would get another shot at the aew championship somewhere down the road cole started to talk about mjf and how his neck is banged up but guaranteed he would be there on sunday at all out roddy strong mike bennett and matt taven walked to the ring roddy bitched about adam caring more about mjfs neck than his cole said this entire thing is getting absurd bennett spoke up and detailed his history with cole from the match they had that got them signed to roh and all the matches they had along the way that made them famous taven then called him selfish because he abandoned everyone who helped prop him up along the way he left the kingdom to join bullet club and then he left bullet club to go to florida and surround himself with all their friends taven asked cole if he looks at pictures of his past and only sees himself because thats the only person hes ever cared about cole then apologized if he made them feel that way but they have to accept that mjf is his friend and even his best friend roderick strong refused to accept that and told cole that he was entering the aew grand slam tournament cole told him that was a mistake because his neck wasnt close to 100 roddy said that he doesnt need to be 100 to defeat people decisively and he doesnt need roll ups or diamond rings to get the job done like coles friend mjf because hes a wrestling legend cole told them off mic that he was making a mistake and that he had done nothing wrong penta was shown in a pretaped promo where told orange cassidy that their match was not personal and then told moxley he was coming for him because he hurt his brother alex abrahantes then said it was time for the international title to be in the hands of someone with no fear back in the arena we got entrances for the next match kris statlander hikaru shida and britt baker made their entrances first they were followed by nyla rose emi sakura and marina shafir 3 nyla rose emi sakura and marina shafir vs kris statlander hikaru shida and britt baker shida landed some strikes on emi sakura to start the match followed by mounted punches in the corner she then landed a dropkick and tagged in britt baker who landed a slingblade the heels took control on baker and made quick tags to isolate her in their corner my take the cole segment with the kingdom pushed the story forward roddy taven and bennett arent always the best promos but they performed well here it seems like this story is being extended to grand slam at least so itll be interesting to see if it reaches the next milestone there or if there is a major turning point during the grand slam tournament the heels remained in control due to a couple of friendly fire incidents between baker and shida nyla landed a chokeslam on baker and traded blows with statlander kris dumped all the heels to the floor and then dove on the pile at ringside she then tossed marina shafir back in the ring and landed wednesday night fever on shafir and got the win kris statlander hikaru shida and britt baker defeated emi sakua nyla rose and marina shafir at 731 after the match statlander celebrated but was ambushed by ruby soho she landed a no future kick and then took off up the ramp with the tbs title she laid it out on the ramp and pointed at statlander back in the ring a video package established that shane taylor will take on samoa joe for the roh tv championship at all out in the back don callis strategized with konosuke takeshita about taking advantage of kenny omegas many injuries and if that fails callis will stab him with a screwdriver penta vs orange cassidy was advertised for later my take the womens match seemed to exist to establish a rift between hikaru shida and britt baker i assume one of the two of them will be the first to challenge saraya all out still feels mighty thin with very few high profile matches and satisfying story pay off moments the acclaimed made their entrance as the new trios championships max caster joked about mitch mcconnell freezing and trumps mugshot billy gunn asked them to turn down the music because they are short on time he announced daddy ass was back and said he had a great day capturing the trios champions caster said they thought it was fitting to come back to chicago the crowd that lifted up the acclaimed and promise that they would lift up the trios titles and dominate that division caster said they would have a ribbon cutting ceremony which prompted scissor me daddy chants caster pulled out a scissors and it was tiny leading to billy bring out a much larger one for the obvious dick joke they cut the ribbon and bowens declared this a new era he termed themselves the house of ass and they wear pink in their house he then unveiled new trios title belts with a hot pink leather strap that scissors at the back browns then announced they would defend the aew trios titles on saturday at collision they then put their titles together to scissor them and wrapped up the segment the announce team plugged the roh tag team championship battle royal on rampage with a video package bryan keith will take on adam page on rampage as well he then sped through upcoming match announcements as a pace that i could not keep up with he plugged rampage collision and all out the main event between orange cassidy and penta el zero miedo is up next penta made his entrance in the arena my take the custom trios titles bit was cute but what is that division at this point are they going to form new teams to compete with them go back to house of black orange cassidy made his entrance as the show returned 4 orange cassidy vs penta el zero miedo for the aew international title they had a stare down early on before working a tight sequence of arm drags and trips cassidy grabbed as his sore neck and then used an arm twist to flip penta onto the mat he then put his hands in his pockets and hit the ropes landing an arm drag that sent penta outside the ring he then attempted a suicide dive but penta caught him in a press slam position and slammed him into a nearby barricade very impressive penta landed a gnarly suicide dive on cassidy he then landed a leg drop back in the ring and covered for a near fall penta landed a kick on the apron and set up for a brainbuster but cassidy reversed into a stunner he then followed up with a ddt and covered for a two count penta recovered and landed a running kick to the ribs in the corner he then landed a backstabber and covered for a near fall cassidy landed a thrust kick and penta replied with a sling blade for a near fall penta looked to snap the arm of cassidy but he was able to get his hands in his pocket he landed some light strikes but penta ignored him they then traded a series of canadian destroyers penta followed up with a made in japan for another close near fall he then setup for a package piledriver but cassidy reversed out with a backdrop and covered for a near fall cassidy lined up for an orange punch but penta kicked his hand he then stomped on the hand as cassidy rolled to the apron they traded kicks on the apron penta eventually landed fear factor on the apron but cassidy grabbed the ropes to break the fall penta pulled him to the center of the ring and stomped on his hand and then snapped his bad arm he then landed another fear factor but only got a near fall cassidy pulled a shocked penta into a crucifix pin and got the win orange cassidy defeated penta el zero miedo at 1702 after the match the ref checked on cassidy and handed him the belt cassidy the grabbed a chair and a microphone and said he was tired and his body hurts he said every title defense the backpack gets a little heavier but the international championship means everything to him its about somebody who was told he was too skinny too short and too different to make it he addressed jon moxley and said that he better bring more than a fork because he would be the international champion for as long as he wants he said his name is orange cassidy and he doesnt have a catchphrase jon moxley walked to the ring and slapped cassidy who then slapped him back they stared each other down to end the show my take good to see cassidy get some promo time i have to think all out is the end of the road for his title reign but hes had a hell of a run his improbable title retentions are always crowd pleasers but i think hes overdue for a push further up the card all that said i feel like all out is by far aew weakest ppv effort to date and has really suffered from tony khans booking philosphy of waiting until the last minute to really establish angles and build matches if the buyrates are down i dont think hell have to look much further than the mirror listen to pro wrestling boom podcast on spreaker we value your privacy privacy policy info here

diamante wbillie starkz vs hikaru shida willow nightingale and skye blue in a trios match all six wrestlers stood in the ring athena acted like she was going to start for her team but then she shoved one of her partners at willow and darted to ringside martinez and diamante confronted athena on the floor blue dove from the top rope onto all three heels later skye went up top and was cut off by martinez in an ugly spot martinez suplexed skye from the ropes skye landed rough and folded like an accordion and yet for some reason one of the broadcast team members was cracking up hopefully about something unrelated athena and shida squared off briefly but they were both pulled to ringside by opponents blue was back on her feet and seemed fine willow hit the pounce on athena at ringside back in the ring willow hoisted up diamante and tagged out blue kicked diamante and then willow performed a death valley driver blue followed up with an awful code blue and scored the pin hikaru shida willow nightingale and skye blue defeated athena mercedes martinez and diamante in 830 powells pov a rough finish its hard to imagine that the vast majority of viewers are watching roh which means

riccaboni and caprice coleman were on commentary and bobby cruise was the ring announcer unless otherwise noted all matches started and ended with the code of honor handshake the show opened with a recap of every death before dishonor match narrated by ian riccaboni who plugged that you can still catch a replay on demand now very nice touch this was awesome 1 eli isom vs josh woods wmark sterling in a pure rules match jerry lynn and jimmy jacobs were announced as judges for this match and then shibata was announced as the third judge ari daivari and tony nese came out to the stage with woods and sterling but went to the back early on woods pushed isom around into the ropes until the ref called for a rope break to be taken from isom the men did some chain wrestling before they traded arm drags and isom got the advantage with an arm bar woods got the advantage by kicking out isoms arm on a tip up attempt and he started working it over isom blocked an irish whip attempt and used his second rope break woods continued to work on the shoulder but isom fought back with forearms showing some good fighting spirit isom hit a blue thunder bomb and got a one count woods tried for a roll through german but instead he rolled into a cross arm breaker that forced isom to use his last rope break woods locked in a sleeper from the apron and pulled isom back into the ring then he sat isom down hit a pk while staring down shibata and then he locked in his gorilla lock finisher josh woods defeated eli isom by submission in 900 in a pure rules match sterling grabbed the mic and said that woods should be the face of the pure division and touted his amateur record sterling made the challenge for the woods vs shibata match for next week shibata rolled into the ring and held his title up while face to face with woods sterling pulled woods away because they dont do anything without contracts 4 leyla hirsch vs b3cca no televised entrance for b3cca hirsch kicked away the code of honor handshake b3cca was really popular with the crowd as shes a local but hirsch took her apart with some nice looking shoulder blocks and clotheslines hirsch hit a vertical suplex and looked into the camera and said too easy b3cca made a comeback with a drop kick that got the crowd going crazy b3cca hit a big kick and then went for a middle rope drop kick hirsch noped it hirsch hit a big knee to the face and got the pinfall leyla hirsch defeated b3cca by pinfall in 200 robinsons ruminations just a showcase win for hirsch but she got some good heat because of b3ccas hometown reaction lexi in the back interviewed athena athena kept asking for the locker room to step up she told lexi to find her better talent or its going to be her 5 charlette renegade and robyn renegade vs tiara james and jc no entrance for james and jc jc got a quick two count on a renegade with a vertical suplex robyn on the outside tripped jc and tagged in and cut off jc the renegades hit a stalling vertical suplex and got a two count they both hit shh chops that got the crowd to ooo they tried another stalling vertical and jc fought out and tagged james james went house of fire on the renegades hitting a bulldog and tried for another big move and got cut off the renegades hit a hart attack slingblade move for the pinfall the renegades defeated tiara james and jc by pinfall in 400  robinsons ruminations showcase win for the renegades but i dont see whats to showcase these girls are still a little slow and awkward in the ring 6 roh womens champion athena vs christina marie in a proving ground match christina took the fight to athena right away and hit a rolling neck snap for a one count athena came right back with a big forearm that rocked marie athena hit some dropkicks that knocked marie out of the ring the announcers talked up athena maybe breaking samoa joes world title reign of 600 days athena worked marie over with some big strikes and finished it up with a huge forearm for the pinfall athena defeated christina marie by 330 after the match athena threw marie into the barricades at ringside robinsons ruminations another win for athena no new developments here 7 tracy williams and rhett titus vs the kingdom mike bennett and matt taven wmaria williams stood tall against some bennett strikes so bennett tagged in taven they hit some double team offense and got a quick two count after a middle rope drop kick titus tagged in and took taven on an airplane ride and back suplex for a two count the kingdom used dirty tactics to cut titus off and they hit some more double team offense for a two count on titus bennett hit a spinebuster and taven went for a springboard moonsault but titus got the knees up and tagged in williams who chopped the crap out of the kingdom williams hit his corner ddt and locked in a clover leaf but bennett broke it up titus took bennett out with his belly to belly and they hit some tandem offense on taven they got a two count for it as bennett broke it up bennett and williams traded chops and they both locked in submissions on their other opponents and then went back to trading strikes williams and bennett hit piledrivers on their opponents and went back to trading strikes williams eventually hit a bit clothesline and got a two count because of a weak cover taven and titus tagged in and titus nailed him with a huge dropkick bennett tagged in and hit a dvd and then they hit the proton pack for the pinfall the kingdom matt taven and mike bennett defeated tracy williams and rhett titus by pinfall in 900 robinsons ruminations that was a super fun match and i really enjoyed the strike fest between williams and bennett down the stretch lexi interviewed stokely hathaway and samoa joe backstage stokely announced another tournament to crown a number one contender for the tv title lexi questioned if there was some favoritism but joe bullied stokely into telling off lexi 8 jd drake vs christopher daniels in a roh tv title eliminator tournament match riccaboni told us that this tournament is an 8man tournament while drake made his entrance but no hint as to who else is in let alone a bracket daniels hit an early single leg dropkick to take control drake came right back with a running avalanche during the match we got told the rest of the first round matches of the tournament and it sounded like wed get them all tonight drake hit a bossman slam for a two count drake hit two senton splashes and the crowd chanted one more time and drake didnt oblige to boos the men traded chops but daniels hit a flatliner daniels chopped drake down with some strikes daniels hit a middle rope swinging slam for a two count drake came back with a dropkick and a cannonball for a two count drake went to the top and tried for a moonsault but no one home daniels put drake down and hit bme for the pinfall christopher daniels defeated jd drake by pinfall in 615 to advance in the tournament daniels gave drake some love after the match robinsons ruminations a fine television match between these two nothing wrong with it at all but daniels is a step slow these days so its not really worth going out of your way to see 9 lee moriarty and big bill vs gabriel hodder and adrien soriano moriarty immediately locked in a crossface variant that made soriano scramble for the ropes hodder got tagged in and he ate a big dropkick from moriarty hodder hit a clothesline and tagged in soriano and they worked over moriarty and posed big bill got tagged in and hit a double clothesline on them bill hit a bossman slam and hit a stalling chokeslam for the pinfall lee moriarty and big bill defeated gabriel hodder and adrien soriano by 300 robinsons ruminations a squash win for moriarty and bill 10 tony nese wmark sterling ari daivari vs cheeseburger in an roh tv title eliminator tournament match nese cut a promo on his way to the ring about how he intends to win the tournament and that cheeseburgers are fattening foods then he did his personal trainer bit cheeseburgers entrance cut him off pretty quickly cheeseburger worked some british chain wrestling and lucha submissions nese cut off cheeseburger when he went up top and hit a gourdbuster for a two count nese hung burger in the tree of woe and did some crunch kicks on him the crowd was firmly behind cheeseburger as he fought out of a vertical suplex attempt cheeseburger came back with a vertical suplex of his own cheeseburger hit a running palm strike that the announcers had been talking up as a knockout shot but nese kicked out at two the men traded waistlocks until burger got in front of nese and nailed a ddt sterling distracted burger and then nese hit a pumphandle michinoku driver for the pinfall tony nese defeated cheeseburger by pinfall in 650 to advance in the tournament robinsons ruminations fun match cheeseburger is a fun act but i didnt expect him to win here in a tournament 11 anthony henry vs gravity in a roh tv title eliminator tournament match henry kicked away the code of honor handshake gravity hit an early arm drag and then did a bunch of kip ups to try and escape an arm lock but henry just dropped him they traded arm bar attempts and flip outs henry got dumped to ringside and gravity dove out after him but barely cleared the top rope gravity did a headstand on the apron and ate a superkick for it henry got a two count of a death valley driver henry hit a pk to the back and then stomped on gravitys hands gravity came back with a lucha flipping armdrag and then a backspring back elbow gravity hit a

up and rolled up henry for two henry hit a falcon arrow for a two count henry hit a jackknife ddt for a two count gravity fought through some strikes and hit a rolling slam and then hit a spaceman splash off the top for the three count gravity defeated anthony henry in 600 robinsons ruminations a win for gravity but another instance of the opponent really doing a lot of work to make him look good im not a fan of this kid he still needs some seasoning 12 serpentico vs shane taylor in an roh tv title eliminator tournament match serpentico got a good start with some speed and a head scissors that only put taylor in the corner but taylor cut him off quickly with a big forearm shot taylor threw serpentico around the ring with some beal tosses telling him lets get some miles taylor hit a big lariat for a two count that shocked the announcers as they thought it was three taylor hit a slam for another two count serpentico flipped taylor off and made a comeback with some kicks serpentico tried a crossbody off the top but was caught taylor hit a headbutt and a big splash for the three count shane taylor defeated serpentico by pinfall in 420 to advance in the tournament robinsons

castle said hes frustrated and angry and whoevers in his way is going to pay on the way to the ring as the match got underway riccaboni told us that shibata vs woods for the pure title is on for next week castle and kiss traded missed forearm shots in the corner for a while but castle hit her with a dumping suplex kiss hit a rolling forearm on brent and a splitting leg drop for a two count kay hit a scoop slam on brent for a two count brent fought his way out and made the tag to castle castle took out all the trustbusters with suplexes after he cleared house he asked whos legal to the

got the pinfall dalton castle and the boys defeated the trustbusters in about 500 robinsons ruminations fine bounce back win for castle and the boys though nothing special as the trustbusters feel like jobbers the overall show was a bit longer than it needed to be with quite a few squash matches to just reestablish some acts that didnt really need more squashes i will have more to say in my

are challenging aussie open for the tag titles there were a lot of words in there and not a lot of them were understandable this had a lot of ultimate warrior energy and not in a good way 2 aussie open kyle fletcher and mark davis vs iron savages bronson and boulder for the roh tag team titles the crowd was still not really behind the who are we bit from jameson and the savages aussie open cut a promo on their way through the backstage area about how this wont take long fletcher and bronson traded arm work and forearms in the middle to start until bronson tried to press slam fletcher fletcher wiggled out and hit a scoop slam of his own davis and boulder got tagged in they traded shoulder blocks that they both stuffed until boulder ran through davis bronson tagged back in and

double team kick move for a two count open hit coriolis effect for the pinfall aussie open defeated iron savages by pinfall to retain the roh tag team titles robinsons ruminations nice match jameson was a weak link last week but boulder and bronson can go and kept up nicely with aussie open this match made open look tough and strong because thats just what you have to be to look good moving around the savages backstage aussie open grabbed their title belts from tony khan who just clapped backstage stokely hathaway was saying that hes received a bunch of nice feedback about the tv title tournament dalton castle came in and told stokely that he helped joe cheat him out of the title castle said hes seething like a raging fire samoa joe came into frame and said that in two weeks its going to be the boys vs joe and stokely and walked off with stokely chasing him trying to get out of it 3 katsuyori shibata vs josh woods wmark sterling for the roh pure championship the men started with some nonstandard chain wrestling that was fun to watch eventually they traded cross arm breaker attempts and then knee bars they held the dueling knee bars as they rolled out of the ring the men locked up on the outside of the ring and jockeyed for position for a while they broke the attempt at the refs count of 16 and slid back into the ring and locked up again woods got the better of it and got a single leg into a headlock woods fought out of a waistlock by using the rope butt bump thing the ref thought about calling a rope break but sterling got on the apron and talked him out of it with the distraction woods used a closed fist punch to put shibata down woods sent shibata outside and worked him into the barricades a bunch back in the ring the men traded arm bars until woods used a run around a ring post to take advantage woods locked in a double wrist lock but shibata rolled him up for a one count to break the hold woods hit a hammerlock suplex that got him a two count woods hit a gutwrench powerbomb for a two count woods then hit shibatas pk but shibata just hulked up and went nuts with strikes shibata hit a stalling corner dropkick and a half and half suplex for a two count shibata locked in a sleeper hold but woods used rope break number one to get out the men traded german suplexes and then stood in the center and traded forearms they traded dueling pump kicks to the face for a double down the men traded clotheslines until woods got the advantage with his for a knockdown shibata slid out of a firemans carry and locked in a sleeper shibata hit the pk for the win katsuyori shibata defeated josh woods by pinfall in 1113 to retain the roh pure championship afterward shibata helped pull woods to his feet and gave him some encouragement as woods walked away sterling was scolding woods robinsons ruminations that was a fun pure rules match there was a lot of work to make the men look even they created some fun spots that this mentality led to including the lock up spot which was compelling even though it was just some lock up jockeying i enjoyed this one a bunch 4 zack clayton vs dalton castle wthe boys castle on the way to the ring said joe and stokely youll rue the day you acted like a silly goose the crowd really into castle at the start the men traded advantages with some strikes until clayton hit an exploder suplex and really took control castle eventually got a pair of his signature suplexes to really take control back castle hit a big knee lift in the corner and then hit the bangarang for the pinfall he stared into the camera on the pinfall dalton castle defeated zack clayton by pinfall robinsons ruminations this was a quick one but clayton looked good in defeat backstage josh woods got a post match interview he talked about all his recent losses and he said that something has to change 5 nick comoroto and jora johl vs the infantry capt sean dean and carlie bravo trish adora made an entrance with the infantry but went right back to the back comoroto and johl didnt seem to be on quite the same page right from the start debating who would start the match bravo hit johl with a lucha arm drag and spinning back elbow bravo hit a big right hand for a two count comoroto got the knee in the back to help johl get the advantage comoroto tagged in and hit a big running clothesline in the corner comoroto hit a nice stalling press slam and tagged in johl a double elbow got johl a two count on bravo a scoop slam got johl another two count bravo got the hot tag to dean who came in and worked over johl with all kinds of quick offense including a nice dropkick a rope hanging neckbreaker got dean a two count the infantry hit a side kick russian leg sweep combo for the pinfall the infantry capt sean dean and carlie bravo defeated nick comoroto and jora johl by pinfall robinsons ruminations a nice quick win for the infantry give me more of this high energy flashy fun babyfaces will always get my vote 6 leyla hirsch vs miranda vionette no televised entrance for vionette hirsch immediately took vionette down with a waist lock slam and worked her over with a headlock vionette got a couple of quick roll ups that didnt even get counts maria kanellisbennett came out onto the stage quietly to watch hirsch hit a suplex and mounted forearms the ref told her to get off but hirsch got in her face hirsch hit a suplex by just pulling vionette off the ground by her arm hirsch locked in a cross arm breaker for the tap out leyla hirsch defeated miranad vionette by submission robinsons ruminations a showcase win for hirsch maria watching the match was interesting but there was no pay off for it today 7 tony nese wmark sterling vs gravity in a roh tv title eliminator tournament match nese made a hartford whaler dig that didnt land and then did his personal trainer schtick nese took a quick advantage with a waistlock slam and posed gravity made a comeback with some quick lucha arm drags and then a press slam gravity sent nese to the outside but sterling saved nese from the dive nese took advantage with a clothesline and got a one count nese tossed gravity to the outside and distracted the ref so sterling could get in a couple of kicks back in the ring the men traded overhand chops until nese hit a shot to the throat gravity tossed nese to ringside and dove onto him from the top rope with a stalling senton back in the ring gravity hit a rope hanging spaceman splash and got a two count nese hit a nice looking spin kick to the jaw for a two count gravity hit a lifting powerbomb and then hit a spaceman splash from the top for the pinfall gravity defeated tony nese by pinfall robinsons ruminations this was a fine match with the outcome feeling pretty predictable because of the taylor win earlier in the night tony khan seems to be really high on gravity so there might be an outside chance they let him beat taylor but i doubt it gravity is looking better and better with each outing perhaps i was too quick to judge him 8 athena vs diamante in an roh womens championship match athena flipped out of an armbar and hit an arm drag and kip up to show off her agility athena then cartwheeled out of a move attempt to continue to show off the crowd chanted for athena athena kipped out of an arm bar attempt too athena cartwheeled out of a monkey flip attempt but diamante hit two big dropkicks and a suplex that sent athena out of the ring diamante dove out onto athena who caught her and slammed her athena threw diamante into the barricade and milked the out of ring count back in the ring athena hit a cartwheel knee drop and then locked in a bow and arrow submission athena did some leg presses with diamante and then tossed her over her head the women jockeyed on the apron

crossface diamante rolled through and got a two count athena rolled through a german attempt and got the pinfall athena defeated diamante to retain the roh womens championship by pinfall after the match athena thought about making diamante kiss the title but decided against it the announcers said maybe it was begrudged respect robinsons ruminations this was more of a showcase for athena than i was hoping it would be diamante got some good offense at the end though athena maybe starting to show some respect for her competition is an interesting development 9 the boys brendon tate and brent tate vs gates of agony toa liona and bishop kaun w prince nana the crowd was really behind the boys and chanted for them brent tried to keep away from kaun for a bit but ate a huge clothesline that got a two count prince nana got a few cheap shots in on brent kaun hit a running senton and used a cocky cover for a two count brent escaped a few moves and made the hot tag to brandon brandon evaded toa and dove onto kaun at ringside the boys tried to double team toa but they got cut off by kaun and then gates hit open the gates for the pinfall gates of agony defeated the boys by pinfall robinsons ruminations nice quick squash for gates the boys got a few spots to show off their speed and agility but we all knew what the outcome would be backstage diamante was asked by lexi nair about her loss athena quickly came into frame and cut off the answer lexi asked athena why she didnt attack diamante athena said diamante reminded her of herself and that she was missing something 10 cole

kingdom lsg made a comeback with a middle rope elbow strike karter hit a powerslam ddt type of move for the pinfall cole karter defeated lsg by pinfall robinsons ruminations this was a showcase for karter and hes a good looking prospect maria scouting is continuing to be interesting this is the small storytelling ive been looking for a post match interview from the righteous at the ppv was interrupted by dark order evil uno gave stu greyson a handshake and said thank you greyson responded with finally and that was that 11 robyn renegade wcharlette renegade vs christina marie no televised entrance for marie renegade worked a headlock and got rolled over for a one count marie came back with a scoop slam for a two count renegade rolled out of the ring and used a distraction on

on drake who caught him and hit a crazy ddt thing and henry hit a stomp off the top for a two count that was broken up by komander the luchadors chopped drake down with some crazy dropkick offense

the pinfall el hijo del vikingo and komander defeated the workhorsemen by pinfall robinsons ruminations a fun exciting way to close the show im probably going to have to go back and watch this one again later because i felt like i missed half the match trying to cover it i love the workhorsemen and i love how many styles they can work and how many different types of opponents they can have good matches with i just hope we get more of them in more prominent spots down the line as for the overall show this was a pretty good edition of roh on honorclub the match order stuck out to me as a little odd but i kind of understood why once i saw the matches play out another week without hearing from or seeing roh champion claudio castagnoli feels awful to me and i really hope that changes i

honor handshake 1 slim j vs dalton castle dalton didnt have the tate twins with him just some generic nameless boys dalton got right to work with some waistlock slams but slim came right back with a headscissors and a drop kick slim j went to the eyes right in front of the ref who did absolutely nothing about it slim hit a rope climbing rotating kick that looked good slim tried a lucha arm drag but castle caught him and tried a bangarang but slim grabbed the ropes to block it slim got hung up on the top turnbuckle and castle kneed him in the face and sent him flying to the outside castle tossed slim inside and hit some of his exploder suplexes castle hit the bangarang for the pinfall dalton castle defeated slim j by pinfall castle looked into the camera and declared that hes not a meal hes a feast robinsons ruminations a showcase match for castle slim bumped good for him backstage mark sterling and tony nese said that they were not going to have a match against pat buck but it was going to be group training instead 2 iron savages boulder and bronson wjacked jameson vs lucky ali and brady pierce no televised entrances for ali and pierce after a powerslam bronson grabbed a protein shake bottle from jameson and hulked up as he drank it boulder tagged in and threw ali towards his corner with a back body drop so he tagged out boulder pressed pierce over his head but couldnt connect ali tagged in and boulder slammed both of them boulder tossed bronson to the outside with a suicide dive then savages hit their electric chair body press move for the pinfall iron savages defeated lucky ali and brady pierce by pinfall robinsons ruminations a showcase win for the savages not much to this one the savages are still clunky in places especially against opponents they arent familiar with they still arent getting over as the crowds are silent they really miss the orlando crowd that was into them 3 the infantry capt sean dean and carlie bravo wtrish adora vs zicky dice and movie myk no entrance for dice and myk the crowd seemed really into infantry in stark contrast to the last match where they were silent dean worked over myk with some arm drags bravo tagged in and worked over myk in the corner with strikes and got a two count after his big fake out punch myk made a comeback and quickly tagged out to dice bravo got caught in the wrong corner and the jobbers tried to make the most of it but bravo got away and made the hot tag to dean who went out house of fire with punches and clotheslines dean hit a ddt and kipped up and called for boot camp they hit their russian leg sweep big boot combo now called boot camp for the pinfall the infantry capt sean dean and carlie bravo defeated zicky dice and movie myk by pinfall robinsons ruminations another showcase win this time for the infantry happy to see it and happy to see the crowd receptive to them backstage lexi asked hirsch how she was going to keep her momentum rolling hirsch said she wants a shot at athena maria kanellis walked into frame and said that hirsch still needs to build a little more confidence maria said shed be watching hirschs match 4 lee moriarty vs andrew everett no televised entrance for everett moriarty got right to work with some quick action including a stomp and basement drop kick everett made a comeback after some quick high flying moves including a big drop kick of his own moriarty stopped the momentum with an arm twist stomping move and then went to work on the arm moriarty locked in a submission with a bridge and when everett escaped he maintained his bridge to the delight of the crowd everett hit a springboard moonsault and a falcon arrow which got him a two count everett went for a shooting star but no one was home moriarty hit a spinning gory special thing and locked in his border city stretch for the submission win lee moriarty defeated andrew everett by submission robinsons ruminations a showcase win for moriarty but everett got more offense than the enhancement wrestlers thus far everetts gimmick of being a giant even though hes a cruiserweight is ridiculous 5 tony nese wmark sterling vs pat buck sterling and nese did some heel mic work on the way to the ring and even got the crowd to chant for waffle house of all things they tried to do the group training bit and some of the crowd played along referee aubrey edwards was particularly amusing in the background questioning everything pat buck finally made his entrance after a bit too long for my taste the crowd continued to chant for waffle house and buck just shrugged each man hit a sequence and posed with some push ups this turned into a push up contest and nese tried to kick buck during his push ups but buck saw it coming buck hit a huge monkey flip and locked in a headlock sterling made a distraction from the floor and nese took back over with a macho man hot shot and a clothesline that got a one count nese hung buck up in the tree of woe and did his crunch kicks buck tried a sunset flip but got caught with a big kick nese hit a springboard moonsault that got a two count and then tried again and no one home buck hit a sky high for a two count nese got a roll up for a two count nese rolled through a roll up attempt hit a big kick and then hit a running knee for the pinfall tony nese defeated pat buck by pinfall robinsons ruminations waffle house was more over than anything in this match this is the first time ive seen buck who works behind the scenes in aew and i wasnt impressed he looks like seth green and looked to be only slightly more coordinated sometimes the adage of those that cant do teach is correct backstage the workhorsemen jd drake and anthony henry were lamenting their losing streak when nana and gates of agony came into frame nana said that if the workehorsemen can beat gates next week theyll get a six man tag shot toa liona tried to scare the workhorsemen but jd drake was having none of it 6 athena vs rachael ellering in a roh womens world championship proving ground match no televised entrance for ellering the crowd was split for the wrestlers who traded arm drags until ellering got the best of it ellering hit a clothesline scoop slam and a senton but athena rolled out of the way before a cover could happen athena hit an arm wringer and ran ellerings face into the ropes coleman did a great job on commentary making that seem devastating ellering got a school girl roll up for a two count ellering got dumped to the outside and athena hit a big basement dropkick that sent ellering from the apron to the announce table athena ran ellering into the barricades back in the ring athena locked in a cravat as the announcers argued who might be the face of the new roh if its not athena ellering

tried for a single leg takedown but got a scoop slam for his trouble henry got a trap pin for a one count toa and drake tagged in the workhorsemen are the faces tonight because they are in their

ring at the count of nine only to get caught in the wrong corner again drake eventually made his way back up to the apron and henry got a quick cradle roll up for a two count on kaun kaun hit a huge backbreaker for a two count henry for his part really fought through the punishment and seemed to ask for more in places toa missed a senton but kaun knocked drake off the apron toa hit the senton this time for a two count henry hit a rewind kick to get the hot tag to drake who hit some clotheslines and a falling headbutt drake hit a bossman slam for a really close two count henry got tagged in

laughed called him a puppy and said shed be watching his match again tonight 8 leyla hirsch vs angelica risk no televised entrance for risk hirsch hit an ugly looking biel toss as maria walked out on stage and applauded hirsch continued working on the arm of risk risk reversed a suplex attempt with a roll up for a two count risk tried a middle rope crossbody but hirsch stuffed it and locked in a cross arm breaker leyla hirsch defeated angelica risk by submission robinsons ruminations squash match that forwarded the maria scouting story im interested to see where the maria story goes backstage lexi asked athena about being the face of roh athena asked why that was a question athena said shes all the champions athena told lexi to put some respect on her name and that this is her show athena said shes going to find more porcelain to break and took lexi with her 9 rhett titus vs cole karter titus performed a monkey flip and then grabbed a trap pin for a one count titus missed a dropkick and ate one karter played to maria who had walked onto the stage titus rolled through a backslide attempt and hit a butterfly suplex out of it titus hit his kidney punches and a backbreaker titus hit a big clothesline and then his dropkick for a two count maria was shown shaking her head karter hit a ripcord knee strike and then a spin out ddt for the three count cole karter defeated rhett titus by pinfall robinsons ruminations another match to forward the maria scouting story karter looked only ok here but that was part of the story being told which is a good thing 10robyn renegade w charlette renegade vs billie starkz robyn worked an arm and kept up with break out attempts but starkz picked an ankle charlette got on the apron but the distraction didnt work starkz hit a suplex and went up top charlette threw starkz off the top while robyn had the ref distracted robyn hit a shotgun dropkick and a big boot in the corner robyn got a one count after too much posing robyn worked a camel clutch with fishhooks and that got the crowd to rally behind starkz robyn stopped a big boot attempt and slapped starkz instead starkz took umbrage to that and went to work even hitting a gory bomb for a two count robyn hit a half nelson slam and got a two count starkz dumped robyn to the floor and hit a dive on both renegade sisters starkz hit a swanton dive for the pinfall billie starkz defeated robyn renegade by pinfall charlette started the beatdown just as starkz got to her feet athena made her way onto the stage lexi not in sight robyn tried to go after athena but got plastered by a big boot athena took out charlette and then teased making starkz kiss the title but decided not to starkz looked legitimately frightened by the prospect robinsons ruminations a nice win for the newcomer backstage lexi stood by with josh woods and mark sterling she said its a safe space for both of them to talk about the change they both say needs to happen woods said he wants to be on his own sterling said he can make that happen hell even get him a match against silas young for next week woods nodded in agreement 11 shane taylor vs gravity in the finals of the roh tv title eliminator tournament gravity is growing on me but the astronaut gimmick is still ridiculous gravity started off trying to do lucha offense but taylor stuffed it all gravity tried a springboard cross body but taylor caught him and hit a snakeeyes and a big right hand for a two count taylor hit a series of scoop slams taylor taunted the slow mo walk and tried a leg drop but gravity rolled out of the way gravity executed an around the turnbuckle headscissors taylor tried to suplex gravity into the ring but got rolled up for a two count gravity hit another roll up for a two count taylor hit a huge uranage out of the corner and went to the top gravity cut him off and went up too gravity hit an avalanche samoan drop from the middle rope gravity tried his spaceman splash but got the knees taylor hit his package piledriver for the pinfall shane taylor defeated gravity by pinfall to earn an roh tv title shot taylor looked into the camera and told joe that he needs to get out of neutral and that hes going to knock him out robinsons ruminations i was very glad to see this in the main event slot because it really gave prestige to a tournament that had been lacking the match wasnt anything special taylor couldnt really be the base that gravity needed to be as spectacular as he had been against other opponents who have been making him look good that said gravity looked fine in defeat in this match as for the overall show this one was a reset and focus on our up and comers night which is fine in doses but there were definitely some things missing another week without hearing from roh champion claudio castagnoli is a problem i would have loved to have seen roh tag team champions aussie open respond to the challenge from adam cole and mjf on dynamite i also would have loved to have seen at least a little bit of roh tv champion samoa joe looking in on the tournament or sit in on commentary for the finals my weekly roh on honorclub audio reviews are available for dot net members
