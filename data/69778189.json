After almost 30 years in his role, Calvin  believes that he is losing his magical abilities due to aging and chooses to retire after choosing a successor. He is revealed to be the first human to take up the mantle of Santa Claus after the army of previous Santa Clauses determined that the world needed someone who would be familiar with the development of technology and given the nature of Santa Claus that Calvin had naturally within; all of his traits being what the world needs. Liam Seja portrays Calvin as a child during a flashback sequence.\n Elizabeth Mitchell as Carol Calvin / Mrs. Claus: Calvin's wife, who he married during The Santa Clause 2. Carol has grown inquisitive as to her greater purpose as Santa's wife over the years, and is receptive to his decision to retire. Finding success once again in her role as a school principal when they move out of the North Pole, she begins to believe that Calvin's decision was best for the entire family.\n Austin Kane as Buddy \"Cal\" Calvin-Claus: Scott's youngest son, Carol's only son, Sandra's brother, and Charlie's paternal half brother. Cal at first is excited to experience life in his own way, believing that he did not hold the same skills that his father seems to have. Over the course of the series, it is revealed that he possesses magical abilities due to being born in the North Pole and the spirit of Christmas. The character first appeared in The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause, where he was named Buddy after his maternal grandfather.\n Elizabeth Allen-Dick as Sandra Calvin-Claus: Scott and Carol's daughter and youngest child; Buddy's sister and Charlie's paternal half-sister. Sandra enjoys living in at the North Pole, and is hesitant to move away when her father decides to retire. At the confusion of her parents, she often develops close friendships with animals. Over the course of the series, it's revealed that she has magical abilities that she inherited from Santa Claus and the spirit of Christmas.\n Matilda Lawler as Betty: Chief of Staff at the North Pole, and Noel's wife.\n Devin Bright as Noel: The current right-hand elf at the North Pole, Betty's husband, and one of Santa's best friends.\n Rupali Redd as Grace Choksi: Simon's kind-hearted daughter, who believes in the spirit of Christmas.

Her mother expressed desires for the feelings of Christmas every day, prior to passing from a major illness.\n Kal Penn as Simon Choksi / Santa Claus: The man that Scott Calvin chooses to be his successor as Santa Claus at the North Pole. Prior to his new role, Choski is a game inventor, product developer, and single father with aspirations to become the equivalent of \"the next Jeff Bezos\" in the technology world. When he is appointed as the next Santa Claus, he views the efficiency at the North Pole as an opportunity to realize his unsuccessful business aspirations. Leading in his new role forcefully, Simon determines that every day will be Christmas, providing the world with instant gratification through a combination of his business technology and the North Pole's magic. Over the course of the series, he becomes disillusioned and an antagonist to the spirit of Christmas. As the magic at the North Pole begins to fade, Choksi finds himself at odds with Calvin who returns to reclaim his role as Santa Claus.\n Eric Stonestreet as Magnus Antas/The Mad Santa (season 2)\n Gabriel Iglesias as Kris Kringle (season 2)\n\nRecurring\n\n Isabella Bennett as Edie: An elf at the North Pole who regularly reviews the List with Santa, to ensure that good children receive what they want on Christmas day.

The pair first meet when the Calvin family moves to Chicago, and though Cal is an outsider at school, Riley immediately takes a liking to him.\n\nGuest stars\n Eric Lloyd as Charlie Calvin: Scott's oldest son from his previous marriage, and Carol's step-son. Charlie is Buddy and Sandra's paternal half-brother, and though he expressed interest in following in his father's footsteps as a child, he now states that his current job and young family prevent him from being able to be the successor when his father chooses to retire.\n Peyton Manning as himself, a potential candidate for a replacement Santa. \n David Krumholtz as Bernard: The former right-hand elf to Calvin as Santa, who's revealed to have served in the role for thousands of years with the previous figures who held the mantle of Santa Claus, before briefly retiring to marry Vanessa Redgrave.\n Mitch Poulos as Saint Nicholas of Myra: The historical figure who served as inspiration for the legend of Santa Claus. Through his benevolent good acts of kindness and example in the spirit of giving, the spirit of Christmas created magic that resulted in the creation of ethereal figures including the role of Santa, elves, and flying reindeer.\n Mauricio Mendoza as Papa Noel / Santa Claus: One of the ancient successors to St. Nicholas, a Frenchman who carried the mantle for a time and completed his role as Santa Claus.\n Dirk Rogers as Krampus: The ancient folklore anthropomorphic horned being, who served during the Dark Ages as the successor to St. Nicholas; known for his role in scaring children into behaving for their parents.

Wilson replaces Melissa King, from The Santa Clause.\n Kevin Pollak as Cupid\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries overview\n\nSeason 1 (2022)\n\nSeason 2\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \nIn January 2022, it was announced that a limited series that would serve as a legacy-sequel to The Santa Clause films was in development, with Tim Allen reprising his role in addition to serving as executive producer.

season 1 dec 26 2023 absolutely loved it surprising and nostalgic at the same time really funny and a true delight to watch even as an adult all the jokes are excellent it is selfaware and fun for example while scott is packing his clothing for the human world he comes across a sweater knitted with the message sit on my lap and tell me what you want he says oh i dont think this is okay anymore and his wife responds honey i dont think it was ever okay theres dozens more little fun bits like that also i love the lore the world of the north pole the story behind santa the schema of the magic itself is so well done and fun it doesnt take itself too seriously and it embraces a sense of mystery and wonder it is realistically magical because it doesnt tie everything up neatly and it is full of marvelous curiousities and surprises like the christmas memories snow globe room or the magical mailroom that allows letters to santa to make it to the north pole the relationships between the elves the acting and the costumes are all excellent i could go on and on theres so much more to explore and i hope they keep making this show show less show more delia dec 20 2023 started promising and went directly down hill show less show more tim s dec 10 2023 i think tim allen does a phenomenal job recreating the legend of santa claus and they use the legendary figures extremely well i love the fact that the family is here and theyre building off of the family i think this is an incredible show that has a lot of potential to even be greater if written and done well and people should definitely give it every chance they good i highly recommend checking out the show show less show more skyro p dec 07 2023 entertaining and enjoyable and a good cast show less show more raven m dec 04 2023 this show brought me back to my childhood i am glad it was renewed for a season 2 after that finale it left me wanting to see what happened next with their story show less show more landon m dec 04 2023 dont expose your kids to this for the time being its best not to show them anything from disney except the old stuff from 10 years or more ago that stuff is still great show less show more eric b nov 30 2023 some how the mythoss of conservatives christian values worked its way in to ruin christmas show less show more j m nov 28 2023 the idea a person is chosen to be santa is intresting and shows not everyone has what it takes to be santa show less show more owain w nov 25 2023 a fun holiday tv show it works better if youve seen the movies especially the first two so i would recommend a little enjoyable homework show less show more edward a nov 23 2023 this show sucks they need to bring back lucy and jack frost plus santa doesnt look like he does in the 3 movies show less
