Ron Hubbard from 1967 to 1975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life%20of%20L.%20Ron%20Hubbard%20from%201967%20to%201975", "text": "Having been ejected from the United Kingdom, L. Ron Hubbard created the \"sea project\", taking many of his Scientology followers with him to sea. Wandering from port to port, this period saw his organization—renamed the Sea Org— turned into a paramilitary organization with harsh living conditions and brutal punishments including throwing people overboard and creating the Rehabilitation Project Force, a 'work prison'. Hubbard invented a new level of Scientology, OT III: the Wall of Fire, the space-opera story about Xenu and the Galactic Confederation who populated earth 75 million years ago.\n\nIn 1973 Hubbard launched Operation Snow White, a conspiracy which infiltrated US government agencies including the Department of Justice and the IRS, to purge records unfavorable to Scientology or Hubbard.\n\nCreating the Sea Org \n\nWhen Hubbard established the Sea Org he publicly declared that he had relinquished his management responsibilities. According to Miller, this was not true. He received daily telex messages from Scientology organizations around the world reporting their statistics and income. The Church of Scientology sent him $15,000 () a week and millions of dollars were transferred to his bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Couriers arrived regularly, conveying luxury food for Hubbard and his family or cash that had been smuggled from England to avoid currency export restrictions.\n\nAfter Hubbard created the Sea Org \"fleet\" in early 1967 in the Canary Islands it began an eight-year voyage, sailing from port to port in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern North Atlantic. The fleet traveled as far as Corfu in the eastern Mediterranean and Dakar and the Azores in the Atlantic, but rarely stayed anywhere for longer than six weeks. Ken Urquhart, Hubbard's personal assistant at the time, later recalled Hubbard claimed \"many people were after him\" and if he were unable to continue his work, \"there would be social and economic chaos, if not a nuclear holocaust\".\n\nAt the same time, Hubbard was still developing Scientology's doctrines. A Scientology biography states that \"free of organizational duties and aided by the first Sea Org members, L. Ron Hubbard now had the time and facilities to confirm in the physical universe some of the events and places he had encountered in his journeys down the track of time.\"\n\nCreation of OT III \n\nHubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in North Africa while on his way to Las Palmas to join the Enchanter, the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet (the \"Sea Org\").  In a letter of the time to his wife Mary Sue, Hubbard said that, in order to assist his research, he was drinking alcohol and taking stimulants and depressants. His assistant at the time, Virginia Downsborough, recalled she had to wean him off the diet of drugs to which he had become accustomed.\n\nIn 1967, Hubbard announced the release of OT3, the \"Wall of Fire\", revealing the secrets of an immense disaster that had occurred \"on this planet, and on the other seventy-five planets which form this Confederacy, seventy-five million years ago\". Scientologists were required to undertake the first two OT levels before learning how Xenu, the leader of the Galactic Confederacy, had shipped billions of people to Earth and blown them up with hydrogen bombs, following which their traumatized spirits were stuck together at \"implant stations\", brainwashed with false memories and eventually became contained within human beings. The discovery of OT3 was said to have taken a major physical toll on Hubbard, who announced that he had broken a knee, an arm, and his back during the course of his research. A year later, in 1968, he unveiled OT levels 4 to 6 and began delivering OT training courses to Scientologists aboard the Royal Scotman.\n\nThe unglamorous side of the Sea Org \n\nScientologists around the world were presented with a glamorous picture of life in the Sea Org and many applied to join Hubbard aboard the fleet. What they found was rather different from the image. Most of those joining had no nautical experience at all. Mechanical difficulties and blunders by the crews led to a series of embarrassing incidents and near-disasters. Following one incident in which the rudder of the Royal Scotman was damaged during a storm, Hubbard ordered the ship's entire crew to be reduced to a \"condition of liability\" and wear gray rags tied to their arms. The ship itself was treated the same way, with dirty tarpaulins tied around its funnel to symbolize its lower status. According to those aboard, conditions were appalling; the crew was worked to the point of exhaustion, given meager rations and forbidden to wash or change their clothes for several weeks. Hubbard maintained a harsh disciplinary regime aboard the fleet, punishing mistakes by confining people in the Royal Scotman bilge tanks without toilet facilities and with food provided in buckets. At other times erring crew members were thrown overboard with Hubbard looking on and, occasionally, filming. David Mayo, a Sea Org member at the time, later recalled trying to avoid negative thoughts about Hubbard, as routine security checking asked \"Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?\" and \"you could get into very serious trouble if you had. So you tried hard not to.\"  One member of the Sea Org recalled Hubbard punishing a little boy by confining him to the ship's chain locker.\n\nOn two separate occasions, orders to use R2-45 (killing them with a .45 pistol) on specific individuals were published in a prominent Scientology magazine. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled \"Racket Exposed\", in which he denounced twelve people as \"Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life\", and ordered that \"Any Sea Org member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.\" The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology's internal journal, The Auditor. Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in The Auditor later in 1968. Stephen A. Kent of the University of Alberta characterises such orders as demonstrations of \"the manifestation of Hubbard's malignant narcissism and, more specifically, his narcissistic rage.\" The Santa Rosa News-Herald reported in 1982 that \"attorneys have uncovered evidence to suggest that between 1975 and 1977, during the FBI's investigation of the cult, meetings of Scientology executives were held in which there were discussions relative to 'auditing' high-level FBI members with auditing process R2-45.\"\n\nHubbard taught that the problems of this period were due to \"vicious, covert international attacks\" by the United States government, \"all of which were proven false and baseless, which were to last 27 years and finally culminated in the Government being sued for 750 million dollars for conspiracy.\" Behind the attacks, stated Hubbard, lay a vast conspiracy of \"psychiatric front groups\" secretly controlling governments: \"Every single lie, false charge and attack on Scientology has been traced directly to this group's members. They have sought at great expense for nineteen years to crush and eradicate any new development in the field of the mind. They are actively preventing any effectiveness in this field.\"\n\nFrom about 1970, Hubbard was attended aboard ship by the children of Sea Org members, organized as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO). They were mainly young girls dressed in hot pants and halter tops, who were responsible for running errands for Hubbard such as lighting his cigarettes, dressing him or relaying his verbal commands to other members of the crew. In addition to his wife Mary Sue, he was accompanied by all four of his children by her, though not his first son Nibs, who had defected from Scientology in late 1959. The younger Hubbards were all members of the Sea Org and shared its rigors.\n\nAlong the way, Hubbard sought to establish a safe haven in \"a friendly little country where Scientology would be allowed to prosper\", as Miller puts it. The fleet stayed at Corfu for several months in 1968–1969. Hubbard renamed the ships after Greek gods—the Royal Scotman was rechristened Apollo—and he praised the recently established military dictatorship. The Sea Org was represented as \"Professor Hubbard's Philosophy School\" in a telegram to the Greek government. In March 1969, however, Hubbard and his ships were ordered to leave.\n\nThe practice of prominently displaying the cross in Scientology centers was instituted in 1969 following hostile press coverage in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, when Scientology's status as a legitimate religion was being questioned. In response, Hubbard ordered that, \"Any staff who are trained at any level as auditors (but not in AOs) are to be  clothed in the traditioned ministerial black suit, black vest white collar silver cross for  ordinary org wear.\"\n\nIn October 1969, The Sunday Times published an exposé by Australian journalist Alex Mitchell detailing Hubbard's occult experiences with Parsons and Aleister Crowley's teachings.  The Church responded with a statement, claiming without evidence Hubbard was sent in by the US Government to \"break up Black Magic in America\" and succeeded.\n\nIn mid-1972, Hubbard again tried to find a safe haven, this time in Morocco, establishing contacts with the country's secret police and training senior policemen and intelligence agents in techniques for detecting subversives. The program ended in failure when it became caught up in internal Moroccan politics, and Hubbard left the country hastily in December 1972.\n\nIn 1972,  French prosecutors charged Hubbard and the French Church of Scientology with fraud and customs violations. At risk of being extradited to France,  Hubbard left the Sea Org fleet temporarily at the end of 1972, living incognito in Queens, New York. Hubbard's health deteriorated significantly during this period. A chain-smoker, he also suffered from bursitis and excessive weight, and had a prominent growth on his forehead. Hubbard returned to his flagship in September 1973 when the threat of extradition had abated.\n\nHubbard suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident on the island of Tenerife in December 1973. In 1974, Hubbard established the Rehabilitation Project Force. Quentin Hubbard reportedly found it difficult to adjust and attempted suicide in mid-1974.  Also in 1974,  L. Ron Hubbard confessed to two top executives, Bill Franks and David Mayo, that \"People do not [leave Scientology] because of [their unconfessed sins], they leave because [they stop liking Scientoloy or stop believing it in]\". Hubbard warned \"If any of this information ever became public, I would lose all control of the orgs and eventually Scientology as a whole.\"\n\nFBI raid and aftermath\n\nThroughout this period, Hubbard was heavily involved in directing the activities of the Guardian's Office (GO), the legal bureau/intelligence agency that he had established in 1966. He believed that Scientology was being attacked by an international Nazi conspiracy, which he termed the \"Tenyaka Memorial\", through a network of drug companies, banks and psychiatrists in a bid to take over the world. In 1973, he instigated the \"Snow White Program\" and directed the GO to remove negative reports about Scientology from government files and track down their sources. The GO was ordered to \"get all false and secret files on Scientology, LRH  ... that cannot be obtained legally, by all possible lines of approach ... i.e., job penetration, janitor penetration, suitable guises utilizing covers.\" His involvement in the GO's operations was concealed through the use of codenames. The GO carried out covert campaigns on his behalf such as Operation Bulldozer Leak, intended \"to effectively spread the rumor that will lead Government, media, and individual SPs to conclude that LRH has no control of the C of S and no legal liability for Church activity\". He was kept informed of GO operations, such as the theft of medical records from a hospital, harassment of psychiatrists and infiltrations of organizations that had been critical of Scientology at various times, such as the Better Business Bureau, the American Medical Association, and American Psychiatric Association.\n\nMembers of the GO infiltrated and burglarized numerous government organizations, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nPaulette Cooper, a freelance journalist and author, had begun researching Scientology in 1968 and wrote a critical article on the church for the British magazine Queen (now Harper's Bazaar) in 1969. The church promptly sued for libel, adding Queen to the dozens of British publications that it had already sued.  Undeterred, Cooper expanded her article into a full-length book, The Scandal of Scientology: A chilling examination of the nature, beliefs and practices of the \"now religion”; it was published by Tower Publications, Inc. of New York in the summer of 1971.  The Church of Scientology filed at least 19 lawsuits against Cooper throughout the 1970s and 1980s, which Cooper considered part of \"a typical Scientology dirty-tricks campaign\" and which Cooper's attorney Michael Flynn said was motivated by L. Ron Hubbard's declaration that the purpose of a lawsuit was to \"harass and discourage\". Cooper discontinued her legal actions against Scientology in 1985 after receiving an out-of-court settlement.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n Evans, Christopher. Cults of Unreason.

oficial de marina se autonombró comodoro y se echó a la mar con un nutrido grupo de acólitosyo y el viejo mar acordamos que yo podía hacer lo que quisiese e ir donde quisiera siempre que mantenga una admiración completa y cortés de su habilidad para aplastar como un juguete en un instante las obras de los humanos por lo tanto a bordo mis hombres siempre me llaman señor y yo siempre llamo al viejo

basado en la admiración y el respeto le hubiera sumado cierto conocimiento en las artes de la navegación para él y su tripulación según cuentan seguramente sus detractores la inexperiencia de los miembros de la organización del mar era tal que produjo más de un incidente durante la travesíasea como fuere durante los siguientes ocho años hubbard hizo del apollo su casa con él emprendió un viaje por el mediterráneo y el atlántico que lo llevó a puertos como corfú tánger curação madeira y por supuesto canarias lugar al que regresó en varias ocasiones entre 1967 y 1974en una de ellas se produjo un hecho que marcaría a hubbard y a algunos de sus seguidores de por vida en 1973 tras recalar en tenerife el fundador decidió salir a dar una vuelta con su motocicleta con tan mala suerte que sufrió un accidente a pesar de tener un brazo fracturado y varias costillas rotas consiguió regresar al puerto donde estaba atracado el buque una vez a bordo fue atendido por sus seguidores sin intervención de un equipo médico cualificadoeso provocó que durante varios días hubbard sufriera intensos dolores que agriaron su carácter hasta el punto de hacer dudar a algunos de los miembros de la organización del mar de su personalidad superior para disipar esas dudas y acabar con cualquier posible disidencia a partir de entonces hubbard se mostraría más huraño y severo en el trato con los miembros de la organización del marrecuperado del accidente la flota retomó sus viajes por el mediterráneo el atlántico y el caribe aunque el objeto de los mismos era la realización de investigaciones de muy diversa índole las idas y venidas a los puertos canarios terminaron por llamar la atención de la policía franquistasegún el libro canarias paraíso de las sectas de jaime rubio rosales las autoridades comenzaron a dar pábulo a los rumores que afirmaban que en el apollo se hacían orgías se consumían drogas se conspiraba contra el caudillo y que hubbard era un agente de la ciatodo apunta a que esa versión que pintaba al apollo como sodoma y gomera resultaba un tanto exagerada más todavía en lo que se refiere a los vínculos de hubbard con la cia habida cuenta de los problemas que tuvo posteriormente con esa central de inteligencia sin embargo antes de tener que dar explicaciones hubbard decidió abandonar canarias durante una larga temporadaese alejamiento se ha prolongado hasta el

a veterans disability pension for he certainly wasted no time putting in his application lieutenant hubbard was mustered out of the us navy on 5 december 1945 and on the following day he applied for a pension on the basis of a sprained left knee conjunctivitis a chronic duodenal ulcer arthritis in his right hip and shoulder recurrent malaria and sporadic undiagnosed pain in his left side and back on the claim form ron said his wife and children were living with his parents at 1212 gregory way bremerton until he was able to get _______________ 1 l r hubbard claim 7017422 veterans administration

among his other interests parsons was also a sciencefiction fan and occasionally turned up at meetings of the los angeles fantasy and _______________ 5 interview with nieson himmel los angeles 14 august 1986 rogers was fascinated by the house its owner and the occupants mundane souls were unceremoniously rejected as tenants he said there was a professional fortune teller and seer who always wore appropriate dresses and decorated her apartment with symbols and artefacts of arcane lore there was a lady well past middle age but still strikingly beautiful who claimed to have been at various times the mistress of half the famous men of france there was a man who had been a renowned organist in the great movie palaces of the silent era they were characters all like almost everyone in the house alva rogers thought hubbard was an enormously engaging and entertaining personality rogers also had red hair and ron confided to him his belief confirmed by extensive research he had undertaken at the royal museum in london that all redheads were related being descended from the same line of neanderthal man needless to say rogers recalled i was fascinated for a while ron shared a room with nieson himmel a young reporter who had also met parsons through a shared interest in science fiction perhaps because of the inbred scepticism of newspapermen himmel was less impressed than most by his new roommate i cant stand phoneys and to me he was so obviously a phoney a real con he was always broke and trying to borrow money that was another reason he didnt like me  i would never lend him a cent whenever he was talking about being hard up he often used to say that he thought the easiest way to make money would be to start a religion parsons shared none of himmels mistrust he considered that ron had great magical potential and took the risk of breaking his solemn oath of secrecy to acquaint ron with some of the oto rituals betty too was much enamoured with the voluble naval officer so much so that she soon began sleeping with him true to his creed parsons tried to pretend he was not concerned by this development but others in the house thought they detected tension between the two men himmel who was himself in love with betty was furious that she had been seduced by hubbard betty was beautiful the most gorgeous intelligent sweet wonderful girl i was so much in love with her and i knew she was a woman i could never have then hubbard comes along and starts having affairs with one girl after another in the house and finally fastens on to betty i couldnt believe it was happening there he was living off parsons largesse and making out with his girlfriend right in front of him sometimes when the two of them were sitting at the table together the hostility was almost tangible alva rogers too sensed that parsons was suffering jack had never boggled at any of bettys previous amorous adventurings but this time it seemed somehow different  although the three of them continued to maintain a surface show of unchanged amicability it was obvious that jack was feeling the pangs of a hitherto unfelt passion jealousy as events progressed jack found it increasingly difficult to keep his mind on anything but the torrid affair going on between ron 117 and betty and the atmosphere around the house became supercharged with tension what we saw ill never forget although i find it hard to describe in any detail the room in which i had been before was decorated in a aleister crowley professed the great idea of magicians of all times was to bring into being an antichrist a living being in form resembling man and possessing those qualities of man which distinguish him from beasts namely intellect and power of speech but neither begotten in the manner of human generation nor inhabited by a human soul to find a mother for this new messiah parsons envisaged invoking an elemental spirit of the whore of babylon the scarlet woman of st johns revelation i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots  on 4 january 1946 jack parsons began a series of elaborate mystic _______________ 13 rogers op cit 14 parsons file oto archives new york 15 aleister crowley the book of the law the nightly ritual of incantation and talismanwaving continued for eleven days at first without much effect parsons noted that a strong windstorm blew up on the second and third days but he had obviously been hoping for rather more startling results nothing seems to have happened he wrote in a letter to crowley the wind storm is very interesting but that is not what i asked for on the seventh day parsons was woken at midnight by seven loud knocks and he discovered that a table lamp in the corner of his bedroom had been thrown violently to the floor and smashed i have had little experience with phenomena of this sort he recorded magically speaking it usually represents breaks in the operation indicating imperfect technique actually in any magical operation there should be no phenomena but the willed result not until 14 january was the frustrated magician able to report an encouragingly mysterious occurrence the light system of the house failed at about 9 pm another magician who had been staying at the house and studying with me was carrying a candle across the kitchen when he was struck strongly on the right shoulder and the candle knocked out of his hand he called me and we observed a brownish yellow light about seven feet high in the kitchen i brandished a magical sword and it disappeared his right arm was paralyzed for the rest of the night next morning the magicians had more prosaic business to attend to for some time ron betty and jack had been discussing the prospect of going into business together buying yachts on the east coast and sailing them to california to sell at a profit on 15 january the three of them signed their names to an agreement setting up a business partnership with the hopeful title of allied enterprises it was not exactly an equitable financial arrangement since parsons put up more than 20000 ron only managed to vouchsafe 1200 and betty contributed nothing under the articles of copartnership it was vaguely stated that allied enterprises would indulge in activities of a 120 varied and elastic nature presumably with an eye to subsequent expansion into other fields that evening the new business partners resumed their magical activities and there was a further strange incident involving ron who was by then occupying the role of scribe parsons noted that the scribe had some sort of astral vision and saw one of his old enemies standing behind him clad in a black robe with an evil pasty face ron promptly launched an attack and pinned the phantom figure to the door with four throwing knives later in my room parsons wrote i heard the raps again and a buzzing metallic voice crying let me go free i felt a great pressure and tension in the house that night the tension continued for four days until the evening of 18 january the magician and his scribe had ventured out into the mojave desert on some unexplained mystical mission and at sunset the stress that parsons had recently been experiencing drained away he was suffused instead with a sense of wellbeing and turned to ron and said simply it is done when the two men returned to south orange grove avenue they found the scarlet woman waiting for them her name was marjorie cameron and in truth she was not very much different from many of the unconventional and freespirited young women who had gravitated to the bohemian lodginghouse in pasadena but parsons was convinced that she was his libidinous elemental spirit not least because it transpired she was not only willing but impatient to participate in the magical and sexual escapades he had in mind she is describable he wrote in the book of babalon as an air of fire type with bronze red hair fiery and subtle determined and obstinate sincere and perverse with extraordinary personality talent and intelligence a few days later he wrote exultantly to crowley i have my elemental she turned up one night after the conclusion of the operation and has been with me since  she has red hair and slant green eyes as specified  she is an artist strong minded and determined with strong masculine characteristics and a fanatical independence crowley replied i am particularly interested in what you have written to me about the elemental because for some little time past i have been endeavouring to intervene personally in this matter on your behalf  towards the end of february ron went on a trip to the east coast perhaps to investigate the yacht market on behalf of allied enterprises on 28 february parsons drove alone into the lonely reaches of the mojave desert to perform an invocation of the goddess babalon during this invocation he said the presence of the goddess came 121 upon him and commanded him to write a mystical communication couched in picturesque biblical terminology and beginning yea it is i babalon and this is my book  the seventyseven clauses parsons excitedly scribbled in his notebook became the centrepiece of the book of babalon he believed he was taking instructions for the impregnation of his scarlet woman although it would not have been immediately obvious to nonbelievers now is the hour of birth at hand now shall my adept be crucified in the basilisk abode thy tears thy sweat thy blood thy semen thy love thy faith shall provide  some of the message was also suspiciously contemporary thou fool be thou also free of sentimentality am i thy village queen and thou a sophomore that thou should have thy nose in my buttocks at eight oclock hubbard began to intone his message from the astral world these are the preparations green gold cloth food for the beast upon a hidden platter back of the altar disclose only when the doors are bolted transgression is death back of the main altar prepare instantly light the first flame at 10 pm march 2 1946 the year of babalon is 4063  display thyself to our lady dedicate thy organs to her dedicate thy heart to her dedicate thy mind to her dedicate thy soul to her for she shall absorb thee and thou shall become living flame before she incarnates  when hubbard finished dictating the scarlet woman naked under 122 a crimson robe was brought into the temple oh circle of stars the high priest informed whereof our father is but the younger brother marvel beyond imagination soul of infinite space  marjorie cameron had been well rehearsed in the necessary response but to love me is better than all things  she chanted put on the wings and arouse the coiled splendour within you come unto me to me sing the rapturous love songs unto me burn to me the perfume drink to me for i love you i am the bluelidded daughter of sunset i am the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night sky  with passions mounting the three black magicians intoned a chorus glory unto the scarlet woman babalon the mother of abominations that rideth upon the beast for she hath spilt their blood in every corner of the earth and lo she hath mingled it in the cup of her whoredom  that evening parsons wrote the scribe and i resumed our work this time a white sheet smeared with menstrual blood was laid out on the floor of the temple and a red star cut from the high priests robe was symbolically burned on the altar as parsons performed the invocation of the wand on the naked body of the scarlet woman the scribe droned embrace her cover her with kisses think upon the lewd lascivious things thou couldst do all is good to babalon all  the lust is hers the passion yours consider thou the beast raping 123 in the book of babalon parsons was completely convinced that the magic had worked and that his scarlet woman would be delivered of a moonchild in nine months babalon he wrote confidently is incarnate upon the earth today awaiting the proper hour of her manifestations but in his magical record he was less assured for the last three days i have performed an operation of birth using the air tablet the cup and a female figure properly invoked by the wand then sealed up in the altar last night i performed an operation of symbolic birth and delivery now i can do no more than pray and wait on 6 march parsons sat down to compose a letter to his satanic master in england apprising him of the momentous events that had recently taken place i can hardly tell you or decide how much to write he began i am under command of extreme secrecy i have had the most important devastating experience of my life  i believe it was the result of the ixth degree working with the girl who answered my elemental summons i have been in direct touch with one who is most holy and beautiful as mentioned in the book of the law i cannot write the name at present first instructions were received direct through ron the seer i have followed them to the letter there was a desire for incarnation i do not yet know the vehicle but it will come to me bringing a secret sign i am to act as instructor guardian for nine months then it will be loosed on the world that is all i can say now  crowley who was by then in his seventies chronically addicted to heroin and facing death was irritated by his disciples secrecy on 19 april he despatched a terse reply you have got me completely puzzled by your remarks about the elemental  i thought i had a most morbid imagination as good as any mans but it seems i have not i cannot form the slightest idea of what you can possibly mean on the same day he wrote to karl germer head of the oto in the united states apparently parsons or hubbard or somebody is producing a moonchild i get fairly frantic when i contemplate the idiocy of these louts while parsons fretted over crowleys letter his faithful scribe was facing more earthly and much more familiar problems having contributed his meagre savings to allied enterprises hubbard was badly in need of money he had written virtually nothing since leaving in february the veterans administration had awarded him a pension of 1150 a month for a ten per cent disability caused by his ulcer ron did not consider this miserable amount to be nearly sufficient and on 18 march two weeks after completing his duties as a black magic scribe he lodged an appeal producing a dramatic new disability which he had somehow neglected to mention on his original claim form i have lost between sixty and eighty per cent of my vision he claimed in a letter typed on his distinctive initialled notepaper and as my profession is that of writer my present inability to read or use my eyes seriously affects my income i cannot work either long hours or under the slightest adverse conditions my income at the present time due entirely to service connected injuries is zero would you please advise me as to the steps i should take to gain further pension after his years in the navy ron was well aware of the speed with which the wheels of bureaucracy moved and his need for money was urgent his solution was to persuade parsons that the time had come to activate allied enterprises towards the end of april ron and sara she was only called betty at south orange grove left for florida with 10000 drawn from the allied enterprises account at the pasadena first trust and savings bank parsons approved the withdrawal so that the partnership could purchase its first yacht in the _______________ 22 letter to author from mrs catherine gillespie november 1986 23 hubbard file va archives the next day ron telephoned from florida reversing the charges culling was at south orange grove when the call came through and he was amazed to find that parsons was completely dominated by hubbard after what had been said the previous day culling expected parsons to be cool towards his wayward partner at the very least but parsons made no mention of his disquiet did not complain about being kept in the dark and said nothing about dissolving the partnership he was soon laughing happily into the telephone as if he had not a care in the world and the conversation ended with parsons saying i hope we shall always be partners ron greatly disturbed culling took it upon himself to make some inquiries and on 12 may he wrote to karl germer as you may know by this time brother john signed a partnership agreement with this ron and betty whereby all money earned by the three for life is equally divided between the three as far as i can ascertain brother john has put in all of his money  meanwhile ron and betty have bought a boat for themselves in miami for about 10000 and are living the life of riley while brother john is living at rock bottom and i mean rock bottom it appears that originally they never secretly intended to bring this boat around to the california coast to sell at a profit as they told jack but rather to have a good time on it on the east coast  germer naturally informed crowley who replied by cable on 22 may suspect ron playing confidence trick jack evidently weak fool obvious victim prowling swindlers in a letter seven days later crowley wrote it seems to me on the information of our brethren in california that parsons has got an illumination in which he has lost all his personal independence from our brothers account he has given away both his girl and his money apparently it is the ordinary confidence trick while crowley and fellow members of the oto were already in here i am in miami pursuing the children of my folly parsons wrote gloomily to crowley on 5 july i have them well tied up they cannot move without going to jail however most of the money has already been dissipated i will be lucky to salvage 3000 to 5000 on 11 july the three partners signed an agreement drawn up by parsons lawyer dissolving the partnership ron and sara handed over the blue water and the diane and agreed to pay half parsons legal costs for his part parsons allowed ron and sara to keep the harpoon in return for a 2900 promissory note which covered his financial interest in the schooner jack parsons returned to pasadena satisfied that he had made the best deal he could under the circumstances and _______________ 27 grant op cit 28 parsons v hubbard  northrup my earning power due to injuries all service connected he concluded has dropped to nothing i earned one thousand
