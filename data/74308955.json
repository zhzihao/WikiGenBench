Slow-moving showers and thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall and flooding, which led to widespread damage across multiple states in the Mid-Atlantic, with the heaviest and most destructive flash flooding centered around northern New England, specifically Vermont. Across the affected areas, numerous roads and bridges were washed out, and dozens of water rescues were conducted. Widespread rainfall amounts of  fell across the Northeast, with the maximum amount of rainfall occurring in Putnam Valley, New York, with . Downtown Montpelier, Vermont was flooded, as numerous state roads around the city were closed. The flash floods caused 13 fatalities across several states and $2.1 billion in damage.\n\nMeteorological history \nOn July 10, areas where the flooding occurred were already saturated by recent rainfall several weeks prior, and a large area of moisture traveled from the Atlantic Ocean to the Northeastern United States, likely contributed by warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, where moisture evaporated and produced additional rainfall over New England. The storm, producing heavy rainfall, eventually slowed over the northeastern United States due to a large high pressure area over Greenland, which stalled the storm bringing high rainfall rates.\n\nFlash flooding occurred again on July 16 following slow-moving showers and thunderstorms which developed along a cold front, which moved parallel to a deep southwesterly flow, causing the slow motion. Most unstable convective available potential energy in the 1500 j/kg range, along with moderate convective instability, maintained by the southwesterly flow, yielded re-development of the slow-moving showers and thunderstorms, and precipitable water around the 1.8-inch values also allowed the storms to produce heavy rainfall across portions of the Northeast.\n\nOn July 21, additional flash flooding occurred after a combination of a strong convergence zone and strengthening instability led to heavy rainfall-producing thunderstorms across portions of New England. Precipitable water values in the 1.5-1.7-inch range also allowed favorable conditions for very heavy thunderstorm development. The same precipitable water values, combined with an unstable moist environment, 1500 j/kg convective available potential energy (CAPE) values, and dew points in the  range caused additional thunderstorm development on July 29 producing heavy rainfall, leading to flash flooding.\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nNew York \n\nPrior to the floods, New York governor Kathy Hochul urged people to be aware of the weather and road conditions.\n\nFlooding occurred at the United States Military Academy, inundating vehicles and forcing drivers to swim out of them.

the ocean stateenter emailsign upfernando mota who has lived in the 600 block of pleasant valley parkway for five years told the globe that at least four or five cars a year have been caught in flooding on his street most mota said appear to be people passing through the elmhurst neighborhood he tries to wave them off but often its too latei actually put out markers in my front yard mota said the markers are there so that drivers know thats a lawn because the water gets so high that they cant even tell the difference between the actual road and where my lawn startson monday mota and his neighbor caroline moore were outside assisting a driver in a jeep cherokee who tried unsuccessfully to ford the street it was at least the third car to be stranded in the flooding this weekadvertisementclose to two feet of water rose around the suv leaving the three occupants stuck inside with their feet in puddles of water waiting for the floodwater to recede neighbors helped them out of the vehicle and another towed the jeep outthey think im exaggerating and they just continue through mota said some cars can make it like those big trucks but the problem is that the water gets pushed towards our homes when theyre driving through and that causes an issue the water gets into our homesmoore said the flooding seems to happen after every intense rainstorm these days the curve of the road fools drivers into thinking its shallowthey dont anticipate the water getting deeper moore said so what starts off as about an inch or two can sometimes be almost two feetmoore and mota said they dont know the answer to the problem one idea that gets thrown around is making the stream that runs alongside the parkway a little bit deeper or adding plants around the creek they havent heard from city officials about what can be donebefore the storm started department of public works vehicles were in the area along with a snow plowthe plow was used last week to push water off the street back into the overflowing canal but neighbors gave the idea mixed reviews noting that their lawns were soaked in the plowinduced tsunamiadvertisementprovidence director of communication patricia socarras said in an email that in preparation for the rainstorm the department of public works personnel went to floodingprone areas to clear drains and catch basins two city plow trucks were activated and additional personnel were stationed all over the city with a concentration on eddy street charles street and pleasant valley parkway the fire and police departments responded to areas of flooding throughout the city as neededvideo from resident renee besette shows the plow moving toward her house on pleasant valley parkway on monday creating a fastmoving wake of water close to 100 feet wide that pounded lawns like a sea swellnws meteorologist andy nash who was concerned on monday about another quick inch of rain from storms forming over connecticut said there are signs those storms wont get far enough east to affect rhode island and may dissipate before reaching places that received heavy rains earlierchances of additional flooding seem to be lowering nash saidthe latest weather models show that a band of thunderstorms stretching from central massachusetts into eastern connecticut may go another 30 to 40 miles east before dissipating which would be great news for northern rhode island and the providence area the weather service forecast discussion said as of 405 pm rain could dissipate between 6 to 7 pm and give way to partly cloudy skies and a low around 66 overnight there is a 30 percent chance of rain late of less than a tenth of an inch there could still be a rogue shower or two through midnightadvertisementtuesdays forecast calls for mostly sunny

racing across parts of the region by early afternoon submerged vehicles were reported in the montgomery county communities of upper merion and conshohocken and wires were downthe ground in many

at the weather services mount holly office said the strong storms are the result of a system that stretches from north carolina through new england  but what looks like the heaviest rain could target the philadelphia areadays of high humidity and high temperatures have left the atmosphere in the region like a soaked towel just waiting to be wrung outwe have a stationary boundary across parts of

already gotten walloped in recent days he addedit is really going to really exacerbate the flash flooding he saidas of sunday afternoon the system appears strongest just west of the i95 corridor but brudy said there could be severe storms stretching down into delaware and maryland and into south jerseywe do expect slowly that its going to creep over into the corridor later on he saidits likely
