{"id": 70562258, "key": "2022 Kentucky Derby", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%20Kentucky%20Derby", "text": "The 2022 Kentucky Derby (officially, the 148th Running of the Kentucky Derby Presented by Woodford Reserve) took place on Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was the 148th running of the Kentucky Derby, a  Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The Derby is held annually at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May since its inception in 1875. The 20 horses that ran in the Derby qualified by earning points in the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby.\n\nThe two favorites for the 2022 Kentucky Derby were Epicenter, the winner of the Louisiana Derby, and Zandon, the winner of the Blue Grass Stakes. Both horses finished behind winner Rich Strike, who had only entered the race after a late scratch. Entering the race at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike's victory was the second-largest upset in Derby history. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for his trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win in any race for his jockey Sonny Leon.\n\nQualification\n\nParticipation in the Kentucky Derby is restricted to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. As such, all participants in the 2022 race were foaled in 2019, and most originated from the 2019 North American crop of 20,433 foals. This was the smallest North American foal crop since 1966, in which 20,228 Thoroughbreds were foaled. Participation in the Kentucky Derby is also open to European and Japanese Thoroughbreds, but foreign participation is rare. The field is limited to the top 20 horses on the 2022 Road to the Kentucky Derby leaderboard; these points are distributed to the top-four finishers in designated races. The Road to the Kentucky Derby system was introduced in 2013; previously, qualification was tied to a horse's earnings in previous graded stakes races, which were affected by variables such as the presence of casinos at a particular race track.\n\nIn 2022, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby consisted of 36 races in North America plus one in Dubai, taking place between September 18, 2021, and April 16, 2022. It featured the addition of one race from previous years: the newly created Gun Runner Stakes, which took place at Fair Grounds Race Course on December 26. Additionally, no horse trained by Bob Baffert was eligible for points in any qualification race; if a Baffert-trained horse were to finish in the top four of a qualifying race, no points would be awarded for that position. This rule was put into place as part of a larger series of sanctions against Baffert, whose 2021 Kentucky Derby runner Medina Spirit finished first but was subsequently disqualified after testing positive for betamethasone. In response to this ban and Baffert's subsequent suspension, owners of several Baffert-trained Derby contenders transferred them to trainers Tim Yakteen and Rodolphe Brisset. Two of these horses, Taiba and Messier, eventually started in the Derby after earning qualifying points after the transfer.\n\nThe eight major prep races for Derby qualification are, in chronological order, the UAE Derby, Louisiana Derby, Florida Derby, Arkansas Derby, Jeff Ruby Steaks, Wood Memorial Stakes, Blue Grass Stakes, and Santa Anita Derby. All of these races provide 100 points to their first-place finisher. The major preps began on March 26, when Epicenter won the Louisiana Derby and Crown Pride, a Japanese horse who entered with 16–1 odds, won the UAE Derby. The next three major races were held on April 2, with White Abarrio, Cyberknife, and Tiz the Bomb winning the Florida Derby, Arkansas Derby, and Jeff Ruby Steaks, respectively. On April 9, the final day of major preps, Mo Donegal won the Wood Memorial, Zandon the Blue Grass, and Taiba the Santa Anita Derby. While a Derby invitation is extended to the winner of the European and the Japan Road to the Derby, none of the top finishers from either circuit were nominated for the Triple Crown, and the offers were not accepted. The one Japanese horse who participated in the Derby, Crown Pride, did so by qualifying on the main Road.\n\nField\nThe field for the 2022 Kentucky Derby was considered to be one of the most competitive in recent memory, with no clear favorite in the weeks leading up to the race. The morning line front runners were Zandon and Epicenter, with 3–1 and 7–2 odds respectively. Zandon, the Blue Grass Stakes winner, had a 2–1–1 record (two wins, a second and a third-place finish) in four career starts and finished second in the Road to the Kentucky Derby with 114 points. Epicenter, meanwhile, was 4–1–0 in six lifetime starts with wins in the Risen Star Stakes and Louisiana Derby. He led the Road to the Derby with 164 points. Prior to the race, Epicenter drew post 3, an historically difficult starting post due to its close proximity to the rail. The last Kentucky Derby winner to break from the third post was Real Quiet in 1998. Zandon, breaking from the 10th post of 20, was also figured to run into traffic from his competitors as he had a late-running style.\n\nAlso considered strong contenders for the Derby were Messier, Taiba, and White Abarrio. Messier, originally trained by Baffert, was transferred to Yakteen in order to qualify for the Triple Crown. He was 14th in qualification with 40 points and entered the race with a 3–3–0 record in six starts, including a second-place finish in the Santa Anita Derby. Taiba, the winner of the Santa Anita Derby, had also been transferred from Baffert to Yakteen and was undefeated in two starts. His 100 points were eighth among Kentucky Derby qualifiers. White Abarrio was trained by Saffie Joseph Jr., while his 112 points were third among all Derby contenders. White Abarrio had a 4–0–1 record in five lifetime starts, including a first-place finish in the Florida Derby. Messier drew the sixth post before the race, with Taiba drawing twelfth and White Abarrio fifteenth.\n\nIf any of the 20 Derby entries is withdrawn from the race before betting begins, the next-highest ranked horse on the leaderboard draws into their place. On the day before the race, Ethereal Road, who was set to race from the 20th post, was scratched from the Derby. Rich Strike drew into the Derby as a result of the scratch. He had a record of 1–0–3 in seven lifetime starts and earned his qualifying points by finishing in third place at the Jeff Ruby Steaks. His only win came in a maiden claiming race on September 17, 2021.\n\nRace description\nThe Kentucky Derby takes place annually at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky, on the first Saturday in May, where it began in 1875. Participating horses run a distance of , or 10 furlongs. The Derby is a Grade I event with a purse of $3,000,000 in 2022. Predicted rain and thunderstorms in Louisville, Kentucky suggested that the Derby could be raced in muddy or sloppy conditions. Only three horses in the Derby had previously raced on an \"off\" track, and such precipitation had the chance to alter the race dynamics. However, the rain held off. By the time horses reached the post, the weather at Churchill Downs was  with cloudy skies and  winds. The track condition was listed as fast.\n\nThe listed attendance for the 2022 Kentucky Derby was 147,294. This was an increase over the previous year, when ticket sales were restricted due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but below the expected crowd of 170,000. Coverage of the Derby was broadcast on USA Network from noon to 2:30 p.m. (ET) and then moved to NBC until 7:30 p.m. (ET). The race was also broadcast online through Peacock, NBCSports.com, and the NBC Sports app.\n\nSummer is Tomorrow took an early lead out of the gates, setting a Derby record by running the first quarter-mile in 21.78 seconds. Crown Pride kept apace with Summer is Tomorrow through the first half-mile, run in 45.36 seconds, with Messier following close behind. Messier took the lead at the -mile mark but was soon overtaken by Epicenter at the head of the stretch. Meanwhile,  Rich Strike, who had been well back early, was still in fifteenth place after the first mile and in heavy traffic. Rich Strike moved to the rail, weaved around a tiring Messier and closed steadily in the final furlong to win the race with a time of 2:02.61. Epicenter finished in second place,  of a length behind. Another  of a length behind him was Zandon, with Simplification finishing a further two lengths back in fourth. Messier finished the race in fifteenth while Summer is Tomorrow finished last among all 20 participants.\n\nGoing off at odds of 80–1, Rich Strike recorded the second-highest upset in Derby history behind Donerail, who won the 1913 race with 91–1 odds. He was also the second horse in Derby history to win the race from the 20th post, following Big Brown in 2008. It was the first Kentucky Derby victory for trainer Eric Reed, as well as the first graded stakes win of any kind for jockey Sonny Leon.\n\nResults\n\nTrack: Fast\n\nTimes:  mile – 21.78;  mile – 45.36;  mile – 1:10.34; mile – 1:36.96; final – 2:02.61\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (23:58) (24:98) (26:62) (25:65)\n\nSource: Equibase chart\n\nPayouts \nThe table below provides the Kentucky Derby payout schedule.\n\n $2 exacta (21–3): $4,101.20\n $0.50 trifecta (21–3–10): $7,435.35\n $1 superfecta (21–3–10–13): $321,500.10\n $1 Super High Five (21–3–10–13–1): $741,018.90\n\nAftermath \n\nOn May 12, Rich Strike's owner Rick Dawson announced that the horse would not participate in the 2022 Preakness Stakes. Dawson and Reed told reporters that the decision was made to give Rich Strike time to recover from his \"tremendous effort\" in the Derby. His next start would instead be the 2022 Belmont Stakes, giving the horse five weeks between major races instead of two. It was the first time that a healthy Derby winner did not race in the Preakness since Spend a Buck in 1985. Instead, Early Voting won the Preakness, while Epicenter became the first horse since 2012's Bodemeister to finish second in both races.\n\nReferences \n\n2022 in horse racing\nDerby\n2022\nMay 2022 sports events in the United States\nKentucky Derby", "unikey": "2022 Kentucky Derby", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Qualification", "Field", "Race_description", "Results", "Aftermath", "References"], "contents": ["Participation in theKentucky Derbyis restricted to three-year-oldThoroughbreds.As such, all participants in the 2022 race werefoaledin 2019, and most originated from the 2019 North American crop of 20,433 foals.This was the smallest North American foal crop since 1966, in which 20,228 Thoroughbreds were foaled.Participation in the Kentucky Derby is also open to European and Japanese Thoroughbreds, but foreign participation is rare.The field is limited to the top 20 horses on the2022 Road to the Kentucky Derbyleaderboard; these points are distributed to the top-four finishers in designated races.TheRoad to the Kentucky Derbysystem was introduced in 2013; previously, qualification was tied to a horse's earnings in previousgraded stakes races, which were affected by variables such as the presence ofcasinosat a particularrace track.\nIn 2022, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby consisted of 36 races in North America plus one in Dubai, taking place between September 18, 2021, and April 16, 2022.It featured the addition of one race from previous years: the newly created Gun Runner Stakes, which took place atFair Grounds Race Courseon December 26.Additionally, no horse trained byBob Baffertwas eligible for points in any qualification race; if a Baffert-trained horse were to finish in the top four of a qualifying race, no points would be awarded for that position.This rule was put into place as part of a larger series of sanctions against Baffert, whose2021 Kentucky DerbyrunnerMedina Spiritfinished first but was subsequently disqualified after testing positive forbetamethasone.In response to this ban and Baffert's subsequent suspension, owners of several Baffert-trained Derby contenders transferred them to trainers Tim Yakteen and Rodolphe Brisset.

kentucky thoroughbred association and kentucky thoroughbred owners  breeders ktaktob told tdn that even though the industry has contracted for the better part of a decade were still the deepest part of the lake here in kentucky as far as breeding is concerned the kentuckybred horses really distinguish themselves in open company in north america and also around the world when asked if he thought the yearafter year declines now require bloodstock benchmarks that are based on a new normal morris offered a twopart answer wed love to breed more horses if there were buyers for them thats the first part morris said but the second part is you see what the percentages are of how much is contributing weve never contributed this much to the foal crop ever not to tempt fate but if you look at books 1 through 4 of keeneland september and compare those averages and medians from 2018 to 2019 there was appreciable growth most of those were our horses so it shows that there is an appetite for what id characterize as the commercial market still for our horses as far as larger questions that are outside of the realm of breeders really depend more on the health of racing not only in north america but around the world morris continued wed love to breed more horses i think were breeding quite a bit here in kentucky and hopefully at some point we outlast this plateau and have growth among the 10 states and provinces with the most mares covered in 2018 three produced more live foals in 2019 than in 2018 maryland up 112 california up 22 and louisiana up 21 its really competitive in this region said cricket goodall the executive director of the maryland horse breeders association weve got some new and exciting stallions and i think that piques peoples interest and gets people to pay attention here we also have stallion managers and owners that have been pretty aggressive in their recruitment to get mares because each state around here has its own interesting incentive program and you have to weigh the benefits and talk people into breeding in your state those guys work really hard to get mares from pennsylvania virginia west virginia and other states were all competing for the same pool of broodmares goodall continued so i think its good news but what we really need is more owners thats the next step we have to get people in this business and breeding and the only way to do that is by making it economically viable for people to breed horses and at least recoup some of their investment they have fun and they love it but they still have to be able to get some of their investment back the seven remaining statesprovinces within that 10mostactive list all showed yearoveryear foal declines those that took the steepest drops were ontario down 238 new mexico down 175 oklahoma down 122 and new york down 95 tjcs foaling statistics also included 303 progeny of stallions standing in north america but foaled abroad as reported by foreign stud book authorities at the time of publication the individual countries that led that category were saudi arabia 107 korea 57 ireland 27 and japan 22 tjc reported that 279 stallions mated but did not produce a live foal the 8020 rule youve heard of the 8020 rule thats the longestablished economics axiom that rings true across all sorts of largenumber endeavors consistently showing that the top 20 in any given population base reliably generates 80 of the results it turns out that the 8020 rulealso known as the pareto principle named after the 19thcentury italian economist who coined the calculationis right on the money in terms of gauging the 2019 foal crop if 1631 stallions covered mares in 2018 that puts the cutoff for the top 20 at number 326 on the list collectively that top 20 subset of 326 stallions produced 16369 foalsor 803 of the total crop the accuracy of the 8020 rule when applied to the 2019 foal crop wasnt a surprise to the ktaktobs morris its a trend thats been happening morris said not only has the broodmare population contracted in the united states but also the number of stallions so to infer add value to any marketin this case the bloodstock market read todays paper not a

routine the difference this time is that his entrant in the grade iii 750000 southwest stakes for 3yearolds over 1 116 miles will not earn points regardless of the resultbaffert trains newgrange the 21 southwest morningline favorite and winner of the grade iii sham stakes at santa anita park on jan 1the southwest heretofore set to distribute 17 derby qualifying points to the first four finishers has a scheduled post time of 422 pm today no horse trained by baffert including newgrange is eligible to race at churchill downs home of the kentucky derby because of a possible medication violation that involved medina spirit the horse baffert trained to a win in last seasons derbysince a points system was first put in place for the 2013 kentucky derby the first four southwest finishers have earned 10 4 2 and 1 points respectively if newgrange finishes in the top four the points total from the southwest will be reduced to a range between 16 and sevenbaffert responded with a text message when asked why he chose the southwest for newgranges next starti thought it was good timing and a good spot for him to run baffert wroted wayne lukas who trains southwest entrant ignitis said regardless of sanctions against their trainer top horses should have a shot at the kentucky derbytheyve been solid winners and they really need to be in the race lukas said were penalizing horses by virtue of a positive test on another horse the guy who owns the derby favorite he didnt do anything but hire the wrong trainer and that would be the furthest you should stretch itbaffert has trained a record seven kentucky derby winners seven horses from his stable have also won the preakness stakes and four have won the belmont horses trained by baffert have won oaklawns derby qualifying races a total of 17 times including four wins in the southwestnewgrange should face strong challenges in this version of the race including one posed by dash attack winner of oaklawns 1mile smarty jones stakes on jan 1dash attack has learned his lessons well said kenny mcpeek dash attacks trainer he sits back and he doesnt get overworked and he makes one run the jockeys got to time that but i do think the last couple of races set up well for him now its another level and another group of horses are going to test him im not so much looking backward as forward lets see if he can handle this
