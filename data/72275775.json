border kicking off what was supposed to be a fivephase probe to build support for the impeachment effort democrats have dismissed the gop push saying republicans are just desperate to impeach someone  anyone  in the biden administration of course the house impeachment effort even if successful would fail to win a twothirds majority in the democraticcontrolled senate no cabinet official has been impeached since secretary of war william belknap in 1876 belknap was acquitted  heather caygle and john bresnahan presented by chevron odds of crypto reform are getting worse top democrats say key democrats in both the house and senate say the republicanled effort to reform the legal landscape around digital assets and stablecoins is facing longer odds than ever start with this rep jim himes dconn told us that the houses approach to crypto would likely need to change in order to become law were once again talking about how much oversight the federal reserve should have over digital assets the house bill  for it to pass i think would probably need to go further especially with respect to the federal reserves ability to step in when a state regulator has dropped the ball himes said in an interview its a notable statement from himes he was one of five democrats to help advance committee legislation in july that would effectively limit the federal reserves oversight of statechartered stablecoin companies himes is one of the longestserving lawmakers in the democratic quintet that backed the effort which included reps greg meeks ny ritchie torres ny wiley nickel nc and josh gottheimer nj more from himes weve written before about the fedshaped hole inside house republicans approach to stablecoin regulation while supportive lawmakers say the bill creates a federal floor for statelevel stablecoin companies the federal reserve isnt thrilled about having limited supervision over what it views as a form of private money any changes empowering the fed would be directed at getting more buyin from democrats particularly in the senate at this point we dont expect republicans  led by house financial services chair patrick mchenry rnc and rep french hill rark  to trip over themselves to make these tweaks anytime soon this brings us to the senate senate banking committee chair sherrod brown dohio dumped cold water on the idea that his chamber would take up the houses leading crypto legislation multiple lawmakers have floated the potential for horse trading between brown and mchenrys respective committees browns got banker accountability legislation and cannabis reform that mchenry doesnt really care for mchenrys crypto ideas have not been met with enthusiasm by brown but what brown told us in a recent interview is the clearest sign yet that house crypto reform might already be doa in the senate were not going to pass an industry bill and thats what the house has brown said im certainly willing to talk and negotiate im not going to start with a bill written by the industry that doesnt sound like fertile ground for crypto reform but laura peavey a spokesperson for mchenry said that the bipartisan legislation passed out of our committee provides strong consumer protections and builds off the effective framework set by the state of new york house republicans are still holding out for potential negotiations in the senate productive conversations continue with house and senate democrats and the administration to get this bipartisan legislation across the finish line peavey said adding that it was time for the white house to meaningfully come to the table of crypto bill negotiations  brendan pedersen correction the original version of this story identified repjim himesdconn as the most senior democrat to vote to advance the house financial services committees stablecoin bill in july we forgot about repgreg meeksdny who also supported the package and has served in the house since 1998 the original version also said
