{"id": 74333296, "key": "Occult America", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occult%20America", "text": "Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation is a 2009 book by Mitch Horowitz published by Bantam Books. The book is focused on the role that new religious movements play in the history of the United States; Horowitz argues that these movements, often marginalized or ignored by mainstream culture, played a substantial role in shaping American society. Occult America covers a wide range of individuals, movements, and beliefs from the eighteenth through twentieth centuries, with Horowitz paying particular attention to figures such as Manly P. Hall, Henry A. Wallace, and Edgar Cayce, as well as the Spiritualist movement and its element of greatest mainstream popularity, the Ouija board.\n\nThe book received mixed to positive reviews. Critics praised the writing style and depth of research, but described the scope as exceptionally broad, limiting the work's ability to cover individual subjects. Occult America won the 2010 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award and established Horowitz's ongoing writing career.\n\nSynopsis\nThe central thesis of Occult America is that esoteric religious movements were a founding element of both spiritual and secular American culture. The early chapters focus on an array of figures in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American religious movements, such as Ann Lee, Henry Steel Olcott, Helena Blavatsky, Joseph Smith, and the Public Universal Friend. The first chapter particularly focuses on the Burned-Over District, a region of Upstate New York with an especially dense prevalence of Christian religious movements such as the Shakers and Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nThe second chapter focuses on elements of American occultism less associated with Christianity, such as Theosophy and Western Buddhism. Horowitz particularly focuses on Spiritualism's focus on communication with the dead and its popularity during the American Civil War; the popularity of mediums soared during the Civil War, as the families of deceased soldiers sought the possibility of reconnecting with their lost relatives. He describes the example of Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, whose interests in Spiritualism were spurred by the death of their son William Wallace Lincoln in 1862 at the age of eleven. Though Mary Todd Lincoln's interest in Spiritualism was well-covered by contemporary and later sources, often to discredit her alongside discussion of her mental health, Horowitz suggests Abraham Lincoln may have been similarly interested in the phenomenon; he analyses contemporary reports of s√©ances in the White House and the 1891 publication Was Abraham Lincoln a Spiritualist?, controversial memoir of the medium .\n\nFollowing this general overview, Horowitz focuses on Ouija boards, a Spiritualist invention that became part of mainstream popular culture in the twentieth century. He discusses myths surrounding their origins, such as the idea they trace back to classical figures such as Pythagoras. Horowitz covers the origins of the Ouija board in the mid-nineteenth century; its later commercialization by William Fuld, a Presbyterian businessman who openly disclaimed the object's supernaturalism; and its influence on popular culture, such as its inspiration of the Pulitzer-winning epic poem The Changing Light at Sandover. The book then moves to cover movements, such as Christian Science and New Thought, that focus on the concept of manifestation. Horowitz presents this as a uniquely American-origin form of esotericism, juxtaposed with earlier movements with greater European influence, and chronicles its rise in popularity.\n\nLater sections of Occult America cover African diaspora religions such as Louisiana Voodoo. Horowitz first covers figures such as Black Herman and the pseudonymous Henri Gamache before addressing specifically black nationalist figures and movements, such as Marcus Garvey, the Nation of Islam, and the Moorish Science Temple of America. The seventh chapterthe first to deal exclusively with a specific individualbiographizes Manly P. Hall, founder of the Philosophical Research Society. Occult America eighth chapter deals with the role of esotericism in twentieth-century politics, particularly through Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice president Henry A. Wallace. Wallace, a high-ranking Freemason and self-described \"practical mystic\", took credit for the inclusion of the Eye of Providence on the dollar bill. Horowitz depicts Wallace's contemporaries as increasingly suspicious of his philosophy and motives, eventually ousting him from the vice presidential position in 1944.\n\nThe final chapters of Occult America discuss differences between European and American occult practices. Horowitz argues that while European mysticism in the 19th and 20th centuries \"could seem to cling to secrecy almost as an end in itself\", with a focus on initiation into underground occult orders, American mysticism was far more open. By discussing supernatural or esoteric beliefs openly, practitioners in the United States brought such ideas into the mainstream, inspiring the twentieth-century popularity of phenomena such as astrology and numerology. The book closes with a chapter-long biography of Edgar Cayce, who Horowitz presents as a metonym for the persistent popularity of mysticism in American culture; by spreading a message of \"hope and dignity\" to people who felt disaffected or abandoned by mainstream society, Cayce encapsulated the practices that, Horowitz argues, made large sectors of the population open to such concepts.\n\nPublication and reception\n\nOccult America was published through Bantam Books, an imprint of Random House, on 15 September 2009. It is 304 pages long. Horowitz, who was then editor-in-chief of Penguin Group's New Age imprint TarcherPerigee, was in his early-mid forties at the time of the book's publication. He remarked to The Creative Independent that he had come to doubt he would become a published author; the experience of seeing Occult America through publication encouraged him to keep up a high pace and output of writing.\n\nFollowing its release, the book received mixed to positive reviews. Amongst mainstream reviewers, Publishers Weekly praised its research and \"authoritative\" tone, but Kirkus Reviews dismissed it as a \"hodgepodge\" that jumped inconsistently between subject matters without coherently presenting the history of American occultism. Library Journal described it as \"less than comprehensive\", but nonetheless recommended the work for its tone and bibliography. The Washington Post and The Washington Times both received the book positively in interviews with Horowitz, the former noting its \"evenhanded\" approach to diverse beliefs and the latter complimenting Horowitz's research.\n\nReligious reviewers focused on Horowitz's coverage of their own beliefs and practices. Matthew Bowman, the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at Claremont Graduate University, reviewed Occult America for the Journal of Mormon History. He described the book as \"often gleefully fascinating\", but \"weirdly organized\" in its focus on a vast variety of figures across geographical and chronological bounds. Bowman was similarly disappointed by Horowitz's relatively brief description of Mormonism, which he felt was unduly focused on by the book's blurb, but referred to Occult America ability to cover figures as diverse as Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy, and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as \"an achievement not to be sneezed at\". Eugene Taylor, writing from a Swedenborgian perspective, felt Occult America underrepresented Emanuel Swedenborg's influence on American religious history; nonetheless, he called the book \"a fascinating subject and a great read\" but inclined to \"ignore or downplay the dark side of the movement [Horowitz] is describing\".\n\nSeveral reviewers remarked upon Horowitz's expansive definition of the occult. Taylor argued that Occult America deals not with occultism per se but with what he called \"occult-lite\", a \"sanitized version of spiritualism, magic, New Thought, Christian Science, faith healing, and utopian idealism\" that he juxtaposed with more centrally \"occultist\" Left-Hand Path practices. Bowman identified the book's definition as \"anything Horowitz finds novel, interesting, or appropriately weird\", criticising it as imprecise and arguably applicable to mainstream religions such as Orthodox Judaism.\n\nOccult America was a winner of the 2010 PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award, alongside Anna In-Between by Elizabeth Nunez and Master of the Eclipse by Etel Adnan. The book helped establish Horowitz's reputation as a writer on occultism and esotericism, and was described in 2022 as a \"still-relevant\" publication that established \"his work to bring occult and esoteric ideas into the public discourse\".\n\nSee also\nList of new religious movements\nNew religious movements in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n2009 non-fiction books\nBooks about cults\nPEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award winners\nAmerican non-fiction books\nBooks about the paranormal\nBooks about spirituality\nBooks about Spiritualism\nHistory books about the United States\nHistory books about the occult", "unikey": "Occult America", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Synopsis", "Publication_and_reception", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["The central thesis ofOccult Americais that esoteric religious movements were a founding element of both spiritual and secular American culture.

assembled history on the genesis of spirituality and mysticism and its impact on american culture tarcherpenguin editor in chief and metaphysical enthusiast horowitz charts the movement of mystical philosophies from their origins in the late 1600s he begins with young mystic johannes kelpius who fled his wartorn german homeland for america a reputedly safe haven from old world intolerance for freethinking people like himself who believed in breakaway faiths such as mormonism and christian science but it was the faction known as the occult that most closely unified radical communitarians like kelpius seeking to identify the mystical doorways of realization and secret ways of knowing horowitz asserts that occultism brought forth a revolutionized thought process but concurrently generated a newfound fear in the unseen and the unknown among nonbelievers the shakers having laid ground in central and western new york state in the late 1700s created a sanctuary for folk religions and their evangelism selfproclaimed prophets sought out angels to deliver divine guidance as the freemasonry brotherhood prospered alongside mesmerists and seers this gave rise to the popularity of mary todd lincoln and a host of politically fueled spiritualists the astounding sales of ouija boards the rise of the new thought movement media evangelist frank b robinsons faith sensation psychiana and new age psychic healer edgar cayce all precipitated the negative criticism occultism received as it was blamed for everything from world conspiracy theories to nazi fascism horowitz confines his research to decades far removed from contemporary times those interested in the role of modern mysticism should look elsewhere though occasionally intriguing the disorganized dissemination of information amounts to a mishmash of dates and occurrences within chapters rather than a uniform chronicle a hodgepodge of theocracy and occultism 0 pub date sept 15 2009 isbn 9780553806755 page count

learned through the stories of those nearing death she notices that for every life there are shared stories of heartbreak pain guilt fear and regret every one of us will go through things that destroy our inner compass and pull meaning out from under us she writes everyone who does not die young will go through some sort of spiritual crisis the author is also straightforward in noting that through her experiences with the brokenness of others and in trying to assist in that brokenness she has found healing for herself several years ago during a csection egan suffered a bad reaction to the anesthesia leading to months of psychotic disorders and years of recovery the experience left her with tremendous emotional pain and latent feelings of shame regret and anger however with each patient she helped the author found herself better understanding her own past despite her role as a chaplain egan notes that she rarely discussed god or religious subjects with her patients mainly when people could talk at all they discussed their families because that is how we talk about god that is how we talk about the meaning of our lives it is through families egan began to realize that we find meaning and this is where our purpose becomes clear the authors anecdotes are often thoughtprovoking combinations of sublime humor and tragic pathos she is not afraid to point out times where she made mistakes even downright failures in the course of her work however the nature of her work means living in the gray where right and wrong answers are often hard to identify a moving heartfelt account
