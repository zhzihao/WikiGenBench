On 2 May 2023, Khader Adnan, a former Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) spokesman, died in an Israeli prison following an 87-day hunger strike protesting his continual administrative detention. The same day, in retaliation, PIJ militants fired around 102 rockets towards southern Israel, injuring seven individuals in Sderot.\n\nIsrael held off on responding to the rocket attacks until 9 May, when the Israeli military executed a targeted assassination of three leaders of the PIJ movement, also resulting in the death of 10 civilians. Subsequently, on the same day, an airstrike against a vehicle in Khan Yunis led to the death of two Palestinians. The airstrikes continued on 10 May, claiming six more Palestinian lives. In retaliation, militants launched a barrage of rockets into Israel, totaling over 938 as per the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), under the banner of Operation Revenge of the Free ((). The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) accounted for four of the fatalities on 10 May. On 11 May, Israeli airstrikes led to the killing of two more PIJ commanders, while the death toll from the prior raids rose to at least 26. The exchange of rockets and airstrikes persisted on 12 May amidst ongoing efforts to broker a ceasefire. On this day, another senior PIJ leader along with his aide were killed, bringing the total death toll to 34 Palestinians (inclusive of one in Israel) and one Israeli. On the following day, Israel and Islamic Jihad agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nBackground\nOn 2 May 2023, Khader Adnan, a former PIJ spokesman, died in an Israeli prison after an 87-day hunger strike against his repeated administrative detentions. In response, later that same day, militants from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization launched approximately 102 rockets towards Sderot, communities in the Gaza periphery, and southern Israel. In one of these attacks, seven people in Sderot were injured.\n\nFor a week, Israel refrained from responding to the rocket fire from the Gaza Strip until 9 May when the operation commenced, breaking a ceasefire that had previously been agreed to between Israel and Palestinian groups on 3 May following a smaller flare-up in violence after the death of Adnan.\n\nAccording to Al-Nakhalah after the ceasefire Israeli military pledged to stop assassinating commanders.\n\nBombing\nForty military aircraft carried out a surprise bombing in violation of a ceasefire that had been implemented to quell the exchange of fire across the border. The bombing commenced at 2 am local time on 9 May 2023 and lasted for approximately two hours. Witnesses reported that the attack targeted a top-floor apartment in Gaza City and a house in Rafah. The Palestinian health ministry confirmed the deaths of 13 individuals as a result of the bombing. Among the casualties were three commanders, their wives, several children, and other bystanders. Additionally, 20 people sustained injuries during the airstrikes.\n\nThe Russian consulate in Ramallah issued a report stating that a Russian citizen, who worked as a dentist and resided locally, was among those killed. The dentist's wife and son also lost their lives. Later on, in Khan Yunis, two Palestinians were killed in an airstrike targeting a vehicle. This incident occurred several hours after the initial bombing.\n\nThe Israeli Home Front Command instructed residents within  of Gaza to stay near bomb shelters as a reprisal was expected.\n\nReturn rocket fire and ensuing violence\nPalestinian militants responded to the bombing by launching hundreds of rockets into Israel, over 938 according to the IDF, in what Palestinian militants called Operation Revenge of the Free. On 11 May, two more PIJ commanders were killed during airstrikes, while the death toll from the previous raids increased to at least 26. Four members of the PFLP were identified among those killed in the 10 May airstrikes. On 12 May, PIJ militants fired rockets toward Jerusalem for the first time during the conflict. As a result, ceasefire talks were paused.\n\nOn 13 May, a Palestinian worker was killed and another injured by rocket shrapnel in Negev. Late that day, a ceasefire between Israel and PIJ was arranged through the auspices of the government of Egypt, which negotiated with both parties. Reports about the details of the ceasefire conditions are so far contradictory.\n\nReactions\nIsmail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas, denounced the airstrikes and said, \"Assassinating the leadership in a treacherous operation will not bring security to the occupier, but instead greater resistance.\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem issued a warning, claiming that Israel \"bears responsibility for the repercussions of this escalation.\"\n\nThe United Nations has called for moderation and a restart of talks aimed at achieving a durable peace as part of the international community's concern. Israeli authorities have suspended the entry and departure of people and commodities from Gaza through two crossing points until further notice.\n\nOn 13 June, Amnesty International said the Israeli airstrikes and Palestinian rocket fire could amount to war crimes, saying that the airstrikes were carried out \"without military necessity\" and amounted to \"a form of collective punishment against the civilian population\" and the rocket fire \"indiscriminate\".\n\nCommander assassinations \n\nThe Israeli's stated objective of the operation was a targeted campaign against senior members of the Islamic Jihad in Gaza who posed a significant threat to security stability. Throughout the operation, six senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad figures were killed in targeted strikes.\n\nCeasefire\nIsrael and Islamic Jihad agreed to a ceasefire on 13 May 2023.\n\nSee also\n\nOutline of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war\nTimeline of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict in 2023\nCasualties of Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip\nPalestinian rocket attacks on Israel\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOCHA Flash Update #1 as of 17:00, 10 May 2023\nOCHA Flash Update #2 as of 17:00, 11 May 2023\nOCHA Flash Update #3 as of 17:00, 12 May 2023\nOCHA Flash Update #4 as of 17:00, 13 May 2023\nOCHA Flash Update #5 as of 17:00, 15 May 2023\n\n2023 airstrikes\n2023 military operations\nBattles in 2023\n2023 clashes\nMay 2023 events in Asia\nMay 2023 events in Israel\nAttacks in Asia in 2023\nAttacks on buildings and structures in 2023\nAttacks on buildings and structures in Asia\nAssassinations in the State of Palestine\nAirstrikes conducted by Israel\nIsraeli attacks against the Gaza Strip\nTargeted killings by the Israel Defense Forces\nIslamic Jihad Movement in Palestine\nPopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\nInvasions of Israel\nWars involving Palestinians", "unikey": "May 2023 Gaza–Israel clashes", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Bombing", "Return_rocket_fire_and_ensuing_violence", "Reactions", "Commander_assassinations", "Ceasefire", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["On 2 May 2023,Khader Adnan, a former PIJ spokesman, died in an Israeli prison after an 87-dayhunger strikeagainst his repeatedadministrative detentions.In response, later that same day, militants from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad organization launched approximately 102 rockets towardsSderot, communities in the Gaza periphery, and southern Israel.
