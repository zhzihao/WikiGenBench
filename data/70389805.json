Bevers' murder garnered significant media attention after Midlothian police released surveillance footage from inside the church. Captured around the time period shortly before Bevers' murder, the surveillance footage shows an unknown person, dressed in what appears to be police tactical gear, walking around the church's hallways while occasionally breaking glass and opening doors. Police believe the person in the video is Bevers' murderer. Few developments have been made since the investigation commenced, and the assailant remains at large.\n\nBackground \nTerri \"Missy\" Bevers was born on August 9, 1970, in Graham, Texas. Wedded to Brandon Bevers in 1998, Missy was a mother to three daughters, and the family resided in Red Oak. Missy Bevers worked as a fitness instructor, holding Camp Gladiator bootcamps at Midlothian's Creekside Church of Christ, only twenty minutes away from her residence.\n\nMurder \nBefore dawn on April 18, 2016, there was a heavy thunderstorm in Midlothian. The night before her murder, Bevers informed her students that the fitness class would be held inside the church due to the unfavorable weather, as opposed to the typical site at the church's parking lot. Bevers was last seen on unreleased surveillance footage entering the church at 4:18 a.m while preparing for her upcoming fitness class that was set to start at 5 a.m.. Shortly after 5 a.m., a student of Bevers' fitness class entered the church, stumbling upon Bevers' body. Emergency services were called and the crime scene investigated. Bevers was pronounced dead shortly after the police arrived.\n\nInvestigation \nBevers was found dead with several puncture wounds to the head and chest. A police warrant alleged that these wounds were “consistent with tools the suspect was carrying throughout the building.\" Although police did not confirm whether it was the weapon of murder, a hammer was found alongside other tools near Bevers' body.\n\nPolice checked the church's surveillance camera system early on during the investigation. Although cameras outside the church were not functioning on the day of the murder, cameras inside the church were functional and surveillance footage was recovered. Surveillance footage at around 4 a.m. appears to show the suspect of an unknown sex and identity walking in the church's hallways while occasionally smashing glass and attempting to open doors lining the church hallways. The suspect wore what appeared to be SWAT police outfit and tactical gear from head to toe, including a \"POLICE\"-marked vest, a black helmet, and a black pair of gloves.  Bevers was in the midst of transporting her exercise gear from her truck and into the church when she presumably encountered the suspect inside the church. Surveillance footage shows Bevers walking down the church hallways before her murder, although this specific footage has not been released to the public by the Midlothian police. Midlothian Police has also not revealed where they crossed paths. It is believed that the suspect murdered Bevers in a violent encounter inside the church.\n\nInvestigators first believed the suspect to be a male. However, police later changed their position, stating that although the suspect's gait appears to be feminine, the suspect's sex is not known for sure. Investigators also made note of the suspect's distinct walking gait. The suspect in the surveillance footage appears to walk slowly, sometimes steadying themselves with the wall while having trouble moving their right foot or leg. Midlothian police have stated that this distinct gait may have been due to a temporary condition.  In 2021, the FBI asked Dr. Michael Nirenberg, a forensic podiatrist, to study the suspect's gait. Nirenberg stated that the person's gait is affected by the weight of the gear and weapons, and that there is no relationship between gait and gender. He concluded that the suspect's gender cannot be determined solely from their gait.\n\nInitially, police considered burglary as a possible motive for the break-in. However, they were unable to find anything missing inside the church. Bevers left behind several items, among them her purse and iPad. Sources revealed to WFAA that police now believe Bevers was not only targeted, but that the suspect planned to make the crime appear as if it was a burglary gone wrong. One of the warrants filed by police claimed that the suspect possessed a smartphone with which he might have stalked Bevers' schedules and recorded her murder.\n\nAdditional police search warrants allege that Bevers received \"creepy and strange\" messages from an unknown male on LinkedIn. Police also believe that Bevers might have conversed with her murderer preceding the crime. Law enforcement was able to track down a person of interest who spoke with Bevers over LinkedIn during Bevers' last months, but the person stated that the conversation was ultimately flirtatious and innocuous.\n\nBevers' relatives were questioned during the investigation. The alibis of Brandon, who is Missy's husband, and Randy, who is Missy's father-in-law, were confirmed. Brandon was in Mississippi fishing, while Randy was in California traveling. Suspicions were roused when a published search warrant reported Randy, four days after the murder, bringing to a dry cleaner a bloodied shirt. Randy later explained the blood as dog blood spilled by two dogs fighting. Midlothian police performed a forensic analysis on the shirt, confirming the absence of human blood and the presence of dog blood.\n\nIn May 2016, Midlothian Police released a still image of what is believed to be a 2010-2012 Nissan Altima driving around early morning in the parking lot of SWFA Outdoors, a sports goods store located close to Creekside Church. The car, which police believe has an oval bumper sticker, pulled into the SWFA Outdoors parking lot at around 2 a.m. before leaving just a few minutes later. Midlothian police are interested in speaking with the unknown owner of this vehicle. According to assistant chief Kevin Johnson, the owner of the vehicle is not necessarily a suspect, but wants the person to identify themselves in case they could help the investigation.  Later, In December 2016, SWFA Outdoors released the full surveillance footage from the parking lot. The video shows the vehicle of interest entering the parking lot the same early morning as the murder with the driver behaving in a bizarre manner. The driver circles the store's parking lot, flashes the vehicle's headlights randomly, and parks in a secluded area for a few minutes before exiting the parking lot onto U.S. Route 287.  As of June 2023, police have not identified the driver, and have also not definitively concluded whether or not this vehicle is related to Bever's killing.   \n\nInitially, a reward was set at $10,000 before doubling to $20,000 and rising to $50,000. As of 2021, there is a reward of $150,000 for information potentially helpful in capturing the suspect.\n\nAccording to Midlothian police, tips are received about the case on a daily basis. As of 2022, a podcast called True Crime Broads discusses the case, and was first launched with the intention of keeping people talking about the case. The podcast creators also maintain a billboard advertising the $150,000 reward for any information that could help solve the murder.\n\nSee also \n List of unsolved murders (2000–present)\n\nReferences \n\n2016 murders in the United States\nApril 2016 events in the United States\nAmerican murder victims\nDeaths by person in Texas\nFemale murder victims\nPeople murdered in Texas\nUnsolved murders in the United States\nViolence against women in Texas", "unikey": "Killing of Missy Bevers", "summary": "On April 18, 2016, the body of fitness instructor Terri Leann \"Missy\" Bevers (née Strickland) was found at Creekside Church of Christ in Midlothian, Texas.

appears to be some sort of hammer its just after 4 am and the church is empty allowing the intruder to walk through the halls seemingly without care opening and closing doors as if he were searching for someone or something approximately 30 minutes later the killer crosses paths with terri missy bevers a smalltown texas girl from jacksboro bevers 45 now lives in the slightly larger town of red oak south of dallas she works as a fitness trainer for camp gladiator a national fitness movement appearing in churches parking lots and football fields across north texas she originally planned to host her fitness boot camp in the creekside churchs parking lot but an april rain shower has forced her to teach her class inside if its raining were still training she wrote on facebook the night before her murder at a distance the killer looks like a legitimate swat officer preparing to face protesters or capture a suspect barricaded inside a home the church has surveillance cameras but the video doesnt help identify the killer  the gear obscures the face and even the persons gender midlothian police will later report in a search warrant that in certain portions of the footage the suspect appears to have what has been described as a feminine sway or walk the footage also indicates that the suspect has a distinct walk that is indicative of some type of injury which affects the right legfoot the killer also appears to use a wall to remain steady the video indicates that the killer is a little on the heavy side and stands between 5foot2 and 5foot7 at 5 am camp gladiator

to 2012 model nissan altima that appeared in surveillance footage from swfa outdoors a hunting and fishing store a mile down the road from the church in the early morning hours before bevers murder police tell local news outlets that they dont believe the car is connected to the murder but simply wanted to speak with the driver nearly a year has passed and police investigators seem to be no closer to finding the killer the local police have sought help from the fbi and texas rangers but the case remains cold a legion of investigators unasked have been probing the case via facebook groups dedicated to solving bevers murder case crackers who killed missy bevers justice for missy bevers lets catch missy bevers killer missy beversunfiltered and uncensored the groupsmemberships range from 50 to 1100 citizen investigators who are dissecting the case nearly every daythere theories swirl love triangles gone awry a jealous husband with an enraged father a gas station attendant with a checkered past in efforts to help policeor snag the 50000 reward moneyamateur internet investigators following missy beverscase have analyzed search warrants and still images of the killer in makeshift tactical gear some dissected the outdoor store surveillance video pointing out that the drivers seat is pushed too far back for the killer and that the nissan may have been flashing its headlights at someone police have yet to mention an accomplice others have gone so far as running background checks trolling social media sites of friends and family and approaching missy beversfamily and friends for information they use acronyms to discuss and debate guilt or innocence as if theyre playing a game of clue these musingshave crossed the social media threshold and into the real world wreaking havoc on peoples lives and in some cases wasting manhours as police track down false leads the police seem exasperatedthey need to remember that these are people with families midlothian assistant police chief kevin johnson tells theobserver just because were following up on a tip and talking with someone doesnt mean theyre guilty anytime the police speak to someone often called aperson of interestin the case that person becomes a target for conjecture people were sharing my address says one former person of interest who wishes to remain anonymousthese people have no clue to who i am and jumping on the bandwagon they could gather everyone on facebook groups into an auditorium and tell them the truth but they dont want the truth they just want to crucify somebody police investigators claim neither bevers nor his father is suspected of killing missy their alibis check out the father was traveling in california and the son was fishing in mississippi when the murder occurred in the early morning hours of april 18 2016 on the day of the news conference midlothian police filed a search warrant for a bloody shirt that the elder bevers had dropped off at the dry cleaners earlier that morning and they figured they had better give the news media an explanation before speculation of his fathers guilt ran even hotter at the interview in front of the midlothian police department beversfather does his best to explain the bloody shirts to reporters who seemed skeptical the relatives got two dogs  the chihuahua and the big dog got into a fight the big dog got the chihuahua around the throat ok and when i got the big dog off of it the chihuahuas laying on the ground bleedinghe saidiheaded to the animal clinic to see if we could save it it didnt make itso carrying the dog from the house to the veterinarian clinic it was bloody the reason were here today is because i wasnt really sure if the midlothian pd were going to elaborate on the story his son interjects i wanted to make sure we get over and put this fire out pretty quick we see some flames going on here so lets put it out his father adds all you fb detectives out there im sure havent checked with american airlines to verify they were on the plane headed there nor did any of you check with the phone companies to see that rb and vbs phones were actually pinging in the san diego area at the time of the murder after all thats why we have the fbi and le who confirmed that already because armchair detectives just dont have that ability not only that but fbi drove to biloxi mississippi to confirm with others on the fishing trip that bb was in fact there at the time of the murder as well as verified pings from cell phone towers that he was there for those of you who say bb hired someone to do this again fbi has thoroughly watched and studied his accounts and have seen no large money being moved around bb has been bugged by fbi grilled like you would never fathom and his story has never changed if i could sit you all down in a room with a marker board and show you what weve learned about this case and how much workpeople have been involved brandon bevers has young children whom the family has warned against reading about the casewe told them to stay off facebook randy bevers says social media is a dangerous place to be some within the online forums saw people going too far within days of the murderit was awful in the beginning for brandon and his parents and stepmotherone web sleuth told the observerboundaries were crossedfor sure speculation isnt just limited to missy beversfamily one of her coworkers at camp gladiator found himself part of a jealous wife theory sleuths thought he was involved because his wife had a short heavy build and a broken foot he posted on facebook its trash day when my wife left the house to take the kids to school my neighbor saw a person get out of their parked car and take our bags of trash throw it in the car and drive off april sandoval has found herself in the crossfire of social media sleuths danny fulgencio april sandoval doesnt have much time to look at social media on her phone standing behind the counter on this friday morning in late january 2017 her stepfather the store manager will get mad at her if he catches her on the phone shes been working for a few months at her stepfathers gas station on the outskirts of midlothian just down the road from the creekside church of christ where missy bevers was killed nearly a year ago dyed red hair pulled up sandoval looks dressed to work out wearing black stretch pants athletic running shoes and a gray sweater but the 36yearold single mother of two young boys hasnt been to an exercise class since she attended a few camp gladiator classes in late april 2015 she probably wouldnt have attended then if she hadnt entered a drawing for a free camp gladiator exercise session at ellis county bbq missy bevers called to tell her shed won and encouraged her to attend she attended four sessions out of the fiveweek exercise course classes were held early in the morning in the parking lot at the midlothian campus of navarro college a trainer would show you what to do she says then show youok do this many until the song endsit was hard a lot of them i wouldnt do sandoval quit attending the camp gladiator exercise sessions because she says her mother could no longer watch her sons she stayed long enough to pose with bevers and the rest of the camp gladiator crew for a photo sandoval later uploaded to facebook it was a picture that would lead social media sleuths deeper into her life after bevers death it became this huge ordeal she says web sleuths claimed sandoval got insurance on a nissan altima similar in make and model to the one appearing in the outdoor stores surveillance video a couple of hours before bevers murder they even took pictures of the altima parked in front of sandovals duplex and at the preschool day care on her sons graduation day sandoval claims it is her mothers car and a 2013 model we would be a division of communist russia before my mother ever allowed me to drive it she says regardless of the situation that just wont happen she met with the detective in may 2016 with her sick child in tow because she says she had no one to watch him at threemonths pregnant with her daughter she also suffered from

current pregnancy her former fiance her plans to adopt her daughter to a family who could care for her her attendance at camp gladiator and her living situation she doesnt recall them asking about her mothers altima though she says she believes the photos of it appeared in the facebook groups after she spoke with midlothian police but the detective did ask her to walk back and forth and measured her height before she left the police station a month later midlothian police officer mark holton sent an email to a particularly aggressive web sleuth named tracy aguero i can tell you the picture of the suspects eyes is not anything law enforcement put out there the origin is unknown and is just something put out there by someone who thought it would be funnyhe wrotethere is no photograph we have that shows the eyes of the suspect the color or gender so again the information you sent me is of no value to this investigation so i would suggest you quit targeting sandoval we have talked to her and cleared her aguero claims she listened to midlothian policeshe discussed the case with other web sleuths but information didnt always stay contained in the facebook groups in a post which was screenshot and spread elsewhere she saidi want to again be very clear that mpd told me they brought her in and questioned her and cleared her disclaimer i am not in any way saying that this person has anything to do with this case at all  whatsoever you are free to draw your own conclusions then she listed more than a dozen signs of possible motives that included that sandoval looks very disturbed and sad is notable lonely click to enlarge assistant police chief kevin johnson and the midlothian police department are buried in social media sleuths tips danny fulgencio kevin johnson doesnt look like a small town texas cop with a cowboy hat and a good ol boy attitude like in the movies he looks young clean cut dressed professionally in a longsleeved buttonup dress shirt a tie and dark slacks with a badge on his hip and a glock 23 he describes as not a manly gun but a respectable choice for plain clothes he started as a police dispatcher at the department and climbed his way up the ranks to assistant police chief since missy bevers murder in april 2016 he finds himself addressing reporters often squelching some rumors providing updates  though few and far between lately  or seeking the publics help johnson says while theyve received 1300 to 1400 tips a majority of them were not based in fact but speculation another email from officer holton to an unnamed sleuth appearing on social media seems to reiterate johnsons claim you stated in previous conversation that you would not bother me with irrelevant information and i continue to get updates quite frequently that are using up workable time investigating this case i understand you believe they are relevant i need facts johnson doesnt want to discuss particular situations involving social media sleuths their evidence and the targeting of persons of interest that seems to have occurred he also wasnt aware of the facebook groups that often appear dedicated to unsolved murders until missy bevers murder nor did he know how it would bleed over into therealworld and affect some of the people theyd interviewed in the past containing information from social media has been problematic for some time now johnson says click to enlarge the midlothian police department danny fulgencio he mentioned a case of an accident that occurred out in the county a car caught on fire with the driver still inside by the time police and emergency responders appeared on scene word of the accident had already spread on social media someone recognized the photo of the vehicle and contacted the owners family johnson says he received a phone call from the victims mother who asked if her son were dead we hadnt even had a chance to identify the victim he says deborah halber author of the skeleton crew how amateur sleuths are solving americas coldest cases says a feeling of competitiveness between web sleuths can turn ugly on social media and in chat rooms especially when their names arent associated to their accounts she says law enforcement has a mixed relationship with these amateur sleuths one that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction some detectives appreciate their efforts and others wish that they would not get involvedhalber sayslaw enforcement generally agrees across the board that web sleuths should not get involved in a real investigation its one thing to be online and looking for clues and in that case the police welcomes the public eyes but going further is frowned upon its obviously dangerous and they cant advocate anybody putting themselves in danger for johnson the danger is that the rampant speculation is hurting innocent people and hampering his search for real cluesoverall has social media hurt or helped this investigation johnson says i dont know how to answer that has the information been a distraction yes do we want to dig into every piece of information yes and we will continue to there have been a lot of comparisons  at least internally  between this case and the murder of the kaufman county district attorneyin how that stuff came in about the killer it was innocuous it didnt seem to connect at the time and then the name reemerged when they dug into it it led into another really small detail that really cracked the thing open when the local news story appeared online his son posted a link in the justice for missy bevers facebook group and wrote they just said on fox 4 news that the new poi has recently been cleared ivebeentrynatellya but it didnt change some web sleuths minds in a reply to the sons post one sleuth wrote listen yall just because he is here and saying his family is innocent is not going to change my point of view i have been torn between the tvlv theory and the ct theory since the beginning this doesnt change my thoughts nothing was really said to change them click to enlarge creekside church of christ where missy bevers was murdered early morning on april 18 2016 danny fulgencio creekside church of christ in

the missy bevers facebook groups who are sending out what they call a tweet stormto raise awareness with media outlets and others that beverskiller still hasnt been caught she hadnt heard much out of social media since the detective sent the email clearing her in august 2016 someone sent her all the supposed evidence that had been gathered against her by social media sleuths but the furor of what occurred had faded into memory until a couple of weeks ago sandoval says she received a screenshot of an email from aguero to a detective whose name had been blotted out on a similar note i did make contact with the girl that worked with april for a time over the summershe wrote in the dec 26 2016 emailwe messaged back and forth and shes now downplaying the very things that according to her were very significant when she brought them up a few months ago and she doesnt seem at all willing to speak with law enforcement she couldnt figure out why aguero was discussing her again after a detective claimed shed been cleared aguero says the detective asked her for her files and claimed her new theory about the killer didnt involve sandoval police wont verify if a detective reached out to her for her files sandoval says she contacted police about aguero and detective cody moon replied in message to save everything to back up sandovals claim of harassment so she sent him the screenshot of the email where her name first appeared this wasnt the first time she reached out to police about social media sleuths targeting her as the possible killer on facebook the last detective told herstay off itbut it was hard to ignore the urge to defend herself online thats the reason why she says she shared moons email online to prove that she was indeed talking with police about aguero moon somehow found out and respondeddo you want my help you called for our help correct why do you think posting my email to social media is helping that seems more like stirring the pot and adding fuel to the fire i am more than willing to help you but will not tolerate the drama and antagonizing she apologized in the meantime try to ignore ithe addeddont play into the trash talking on social media it has put a damper on this investigation and caused headaches for usat the end of the day i have three precious girls who have lost their mother but the only thing everyone on social media cares about is getting their opinion out there and arguing but what about my kidssandoval now asks she hasnt met with moon yet she says she doesnt have time to meet with him without her kids because she works until the late afternoon then has to pick up her kids from day care she cant ask her parents to watch them she offered for moon to come by the gas station to chat though it is hard to find privacy at a gas

suspect breaking into a smalltown texas church before fitness students discovered missy bevers murdered insideolivia messerkatie zavadskiupdatedapr 13 2017403pm edtpublishedapr 20 20161022am edtvia facebookeditors note this story has been updated with new informationone hour after missy bevers arrived at the creekside church of christ in smalltown texas she was found dead inside surrounded by broken glasssurveillance video has led police to believe that the mother of three was killed by a person dressed in cop gear including a black helmet black gloves and vest marked police midlothian police say the unknown individual forcibly entered a couple of rooms in the church and may have been looking for something even bevers herself sgt nick harp told the daily beast the strange part is that nothing has been reported taken he certainly doesnt display the characteristics of somebody who is trying to burglarize a place hes taking his time walking slowly aroundbut by late afternoon on tuesday police walked back earlier statements that identified the suspect as male they released a new snippet of surveillance video in which the suspects gait appears to be femininewe are backing off our statement that the suspect on video was a man midlothian assistant police chief kevin johnson told kxastv i know we said he over and over again yesterday and that was a mistake theres a lot of speculation based on the gait and appearance that this person may be a woman its a legitimate question right now we no longer will say the suspect is a man that does not mean im saying this suspect is a woman its just that at this point we cant rule it out we dont know yet police said the suspect was carrying a tool that was used to break out windowsharp added that its unclear how the suspect obtained the tactical gear and impersonating a police officer is a crime if the suspect isnt in fact a copits tragic harp said its sad for the bevers family and the community as a whole its not something that were used to seeing it certainly doesnt sit well police say bevers a trainer with national fitness program camp gladiator moved mondays session indoors because of the weather in midlothian about 25 miles southwest of dallasif its raining were still training bevers posted on facebook the night before bevers arrived at the church in sports garb with her equipment around 4 am to set up for class camp gladiator used the church as one of several locations for boot camps but is not affiliated with it at about 5 am several of beverss students stumbled upon the disturbing scene harp says police arent releasing any other details about the condition of her body or the manner of death besides that she was pronounced dead on the scene by a county justice of the peacea preliminary autopsy performed tuesday is inconclusive according to the dallas county medical examiners office the cause and manner of death are pending and it may be weeks before the medical examiner releases an final reportbeverss friend cody beasley told the daily beast that she was full of lifeshe was an amazing woman its hard to hear what happened to her he saidbeasley met bevers at a dance studio near midlothian where he and beverss daughters took dance classes before she found her passion of personal training while the other parents ignored him bevers was always so niceafter he moved to dallas they fell out of touch but would still communicate over facebookshe was never in a bad mood she never had anything bad to say about anybody she brought the positive out of everybody he said i couldnt image why somebody would have done thatthe camp gladiator community is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of one of our trainers missy bevers the company said in a statement our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this timea candlelight vigil was held for bevers on monday eveninga 10000 reward has been offered for information on the suspect by dairy company oak farms which has helped law enforcement in the area by providing rewards for the last 50 years said local administrator ed spencerwe step up on especially horrific homicides like crimes against children public safety

online of a suspicious car on the morning of missy bevers murder inside a midlothian church the mother and fitness trainer was beaten to death on april 18 at the church as she got ready to teach a workout class police released images of a car they wanted to know more about but surveillance video of it has recently surfaced the video is from swfa outdoors near creekside church of christ in midlothian in april a couple of hours before missy bevers murder it captured a silver nissan altima slowly circling the parking lot at one point the driver of the nissan cut off his lights and turned them back on the vehicle was caught in multiple angles by the stores cameras police say the nissan in the video is the same vehicle seen in a surveillance photo they released in may they said they chose to only release the photo instead of the video because the photo contained what appeared to be a distinctive emblem or sticker on the back bumper investigators say they have yet to id the car or its driver but do not think its tied to missys murder missys husband brandon bevers declined interviews but spoke to fox 4 when the photo was initially released ive pretty much exhausted every scenario and every avenue that i can think of who could have done brandon said in a may interview missys death has become a murder mystery thats attracted national attention the killer recorded on surveillance video roaming the halls of the church with a distinctive gait and dressed in policestyle garb the car surveillance video came to light after swfa posted it on youtube in december the stores owner says he immediately turned it over to police after the murder but posted it recently online after an attempted break in investigators say they would still like to talk to the driver of the silver nissan to officially clear them in the murder midlothian police say they recently had a new person of interest in the case but that person was later cleared related fitness trainer found
