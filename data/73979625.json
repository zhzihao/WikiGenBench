{"id": 73979625, "key": "Doug Burgum 2024 presidential campaign", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug%20Burgum%202024%20presidential%20campaign", "text": "The 2024 presidential campaign of Doug Burgum began on June 7, 2023, at an event in Fargo, North Dakota. Burgum, the governor of North Dakota since 2016, is seeking the Republican Party nomination in its 2024 presidential primaries.\n\nCampaign\n\nSpeculation\nBurgum had been considered to be a potential candidate for the presidential election since March 2023. By May, it had been reported that he was filming commercials and was working with political consultants with presidential campaign experience.\n\nLaunch\nOn June 5, 2023, Burgum posted a video to his Twitter account, highlighting his accomplishments as governor and teasing a \"big announcement\" on June 7. He formally announced his campaign in The Wall Street Journal the morning of June 7, with the launch of a campaign website and a rally in Fargo scheduled to take place later that day.\n\nOn June 12, it was reported that Burgum had become the top-spending candidate in both Iowa and New Hampshire, mostly on television advertisements. On June 21, 2023, Politico reported that Burgum hired Mike Zolnierowicz, former Chief of Staff to Bruce Rauner, as his campaign manager.\n\nBurgum has defended his entry into an already-crowded race with the assertion that additional competition will be good for the party, while highlighting his Midwestern roots and history of working in manual labor positions before becoming wealthy in the technology sector.\n\nFirst debate\nTo secure his place on the debate stages, Burgum offered individuals who donated $1 to his campaign a $20 gift card as a \"Biden Relief Card\", an offer which prompted questions of its legality. On July 19, he announced that he had cleared the 40,000 donor requirement to appear in the first Republican presidential primary debate. In a June 7 poll shortly after announcing his candidacy, 90% of Republican voters responded that they did not know who Burgum was and going into the first debate he was polling at just 0.4%.\n\nBurgum attended the first debate on August 23, 2023, despite injuring his Achilles tendon the day prior while playing a basketball game with his campaign staff. However, at the debate, Burgum had the second smallest amount of speaking time of any of the candidates.\n\nSecond debate\nBurgum's presence at the first debate failed to result in any serious boost to his campaign numbers, and he risked not being qualified to attend the second debate, as he needed three percent of the vote in several polls to qualify. A Super PAC supporting him, Best of America PAC, rolled out a national ad campaign in an attempt to help him make the second debate that was set for September 27.\n\nAs the debate drew closer, and without a noticeable improvement in the polls, Burgum expressed frustration with the polling requirements, calling them a “goofy clubhouse rule.” He also stated that if he did not make the second debate he intended to continue to run his campaign through at least the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries. On September 23, Burgum reached the three percent threshold in one national poll and on September 26 was added to the list of candidates that would attend the debate.\n\nAs the most marginal candidate, Burgum was not frequently called on by the debate moderators, and only had eight minutes four seconds of speaking time; however, he interjected himself to answer questions even if he wasn't asked. Notably Burgum focused on Biden's EV policy, stating that his outsourcing of battery production to China, and shift away from traditional automobiles will only exacerbate problems like the UAW strike.\n\nBurgum's support peaked with a 3% presence in a late September poll, and has polled at close to 1% since the second debate. Larry Jacobs, the political studies chairman at the University of Minnesota, stated that Burgum's campaign has lacked a \"compelling moment\": some endorsement, widely shared speech, or other event to spark a sudden shift in Burgum's favor. By October 2023, Burgum has spent upwards of $25 million on his campaign, with $10 million coming from his own pocket, and with no real shift in the polls to show for it. In an effort to boost his campaign, Burgum doubled down on $20 gift cards for a $1 donation, a ploy which helped him secure a spot on the first and second debate stage.\n\nBurgum's campaign has been notably able to garner large amounts of funds, raising $15.2 million by October 20, despite his low presence in the polls. This is thanks to a series of ultra-wealthy donors backing Burgum, including: First International Bank CEO Steve Stenehjem, actor Josh Duhamel, New York Jets lineman Connor McGovern, Coca-Cola CEO J. Frank Harrison III, eBay chairman Thomas J. Tierney, Milwaukee Bucks owner Michael Fascitelli and Microsoft executives Patrick Meenan and Ryan Kruizenga. Burgum is also supported by a series of SuperPACs, namely those created by Senators John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer, as well as the The Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative PAC, the North Dakota Petroleum Council PAC, and the pro-Coal Lignite Energy Council PAC.\n\nBurgum was forced to take a break in his campaign, starting on October 22, for a special session of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly after the North Dakota Supreme Court struck down the state's budget as unconstitutional, stating that the general budget did not meet North Dakota's constitution’s single-subject requirement for bills. Burgum has expressed confidence in the Legislature righting the situation by November 1st, however, he has to be present in Bismarck to approve the 14 separate budget bills that the legislature seeks to pass to recreate the initial budget. However, lawmakers have made it clear that a $91 million income tax cut Burgum proposed would be rejected. The break was expected to take a full week, with Burgum stating he expected to return to the campaign by November 1, however, the special session resolved the budget and was closed in just three days.\n\nEmerging from his hiatus on October 25, Burgum has focused on qualifying for the third and final Republican debate in Miami on November 8. He has reported that he has over the 70,000 required donors to attend, and the only bar for entry is one more national poll where he is at 4% or better. He has until Monday, November 6, to submit such a poll. Burgum has stated that despite the outcome of his presence in the third debate, that he will continue his campaign, at great personal cost, until at least the Nevada Caucus on February 8, 2024. However, his campaign is optimistic that he will be able to absorb most, if not all, of Mike Pence's electorate, following Pence's suspension of his campaign on October 28.\n\nPositions\n\nEnergy\n\nEnergy independence\nBurgum stated that the issue of American energy independence is an issue of national security. Deriding what he called a “full-on assault of liquid fuels in this country” and has regularly criticized Joe Biden's push for more electric cars which increases U.S. reliance on Chinese-made car batteries. His solution is to open up Bureau of Land Management land for energy-related activities, such as rare earth metal mining and oil and natural gas drilling. However, as governor, Burgum has promised to make North Dakota carbon neutral by 2030 and although he has stated he will loosen regulations for the gas industry, he also stated that he is still committed to supporting clean energy projects.\n\nCO2 Pipelines\nBurgum has been a vocal supporter of carbon-capture pipelines while governor, going so far as to allow three natural gas companies, Summit Carbon Solutions, Navigator CO2 Ventures, and Wolf Carbon Solutions, to use eminent domain to seize land to install pipelines. These pipelines would transport excess Carbon dioxide captured from ethanol production plants in Iowa to facilities in North Dakota to store them deep underground. However, rural residents are opposed to the pipelines due to the fear of leaks, as well as the seizure of private land to create them.  When confronted about the issue at a rally in Iowa, Burgum changed his position saying that he is fervently against eminent domain but insisted that carbon-capture was good for the economy and the environment, and that it would allow the continual use of traditional internal combustion automobiles indefinitely.\n\nForeign policy\nShortly after the start of the Hamas-Israeli conflict, Burgum blamed the violence on the foreign policy of Joe Biden calling it appeasement and stated that:\n“What I would like to say if I am Commander in Chief and when I’m your president is we won’t be having these unprovoked attacks, we won’t have Putin invading Ukraine, we won’t have Hamas being funded by Iran because we would be pursuing a policy of peace through strength as opposed to a policy of appeasement”\nBurgum has also stated that \"Israel has been our strongest ally\" in the Middle East over the last 50 years, and the United States should take more steps to actively aid the nation militarily. Burgum also criticized the Biden administration for allowing the transfer of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets in September in exchange for the release of five prisoners from Iran. He also stated that if he was president he would consider sending U.S. troops to Israel to fight Hamas.\n\nMental health\nIn an interview with ABC News' Linsey Davis, Doug's wife, Kathryn, opened up about her past history of being suicidal and an alcoholic and stated that if she became First Lady that her top priority would be working to find a solution to the \"behavior health crisis\" and working to end stigma towards mental health as well as reworking insurance. Shortly afterwards, at an event in New Hampshire, Doug stated that he believed addiction to be the root of most of America's problems, from crime, homelessness, and mental health. Burgum has stated that if elected president he would overhaul the reimbursement systems for mental health care and would find a place for the private sector to get involved in funding solutions for substance use disorders. As governor, Burgum shifted some of North Dakota's prisons to look more akin to a mental health institution, a policy he stated he would attempt to emulate at a federal level.\n\nGun rights\nBurgum supports the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and the right to bear arms. He claims to be a lifelong hunter and a lifelong gun owner and has an \"A\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund. Burgum has neither stated if he will increase nor decrease gun regulations in the United States.\n\nAbortions\nBurgum describes himself as pro-life and supports a six-week abortion ban, even in the case of rape and incest. However, he stated that he would not support a federal abortion ban, and that the decision to ban or allow abortion should be determined by the individual states.\n\nEntitlement\nBurgum supports preserving existing entitlement programs and should be federally protected. He also supports improving federal efficiency to free up more money for entitlement. In 2021 Burgum signed a bill into law that exempted social security from North Dakota's state income tax.\n\nImmigration\nBurgum has sent North Dakota National Guard to the US-Mexico border to stem illegal immigration and blamed Joe Biden's policies for a recent surge in illegal immigration. He supports immigrants, even illegal immigrants, that are college educated either in their home nation or in the United States to come to the United States and supports creating more pathways for immigration for college educated individuals.\n\nEndorsements\n\nReferences\n\n2023 establishments in the United States\nBurgum, Doug", "unikey": "Doug Burgum 2024 presidential campaign", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Campaign", "Funding", "Positions", "Endorsements", "References"], "contents": ["### Speculation\nBurgum had been considered to be a potential candidate for the presidential election since March 2023.By May, it had been reported that he was filming commercials and was working with political consultants with presidential campaign experience.\n### Launch\nOn June 5, 2023, Burgum posted a video to hisTwitteraccount, highlighting his accomplishments as governor and teasing a \"big announcement\" on June 7.He formally announced his campaign inThe Wall Street Journalthe morning of June 7,with the launch of a campaign website and a rally inFargoscheduled to take place later that day.\nOn June 12, it was reported that Burgum had become the top-spending candidate in both Iowa and New Hampshire, mostly on television advertisements.[better source needed]On June 21, 2023,Politicoreported that Burgum hired Mike Zolnierowicz, former Chief of Staff toBruce Rauner, as his campaign manager.\nBurgum has defended his entry into an already-crowded race with the assertion that additional competition will be good for the party, while highlighting his Midwestern roots and history of working in manual labor positions before becoming wealthy in the technology sector.\n### First debate\nTo secure his place on the debate stages, Burgum offered individuals who donated $1 to his campaign a $20 gift card as a \"Biden Relief Card\",an offer which prompted questions of its legality.

It’s not gonna work. Party bosses don’t pick presidents – voters do!\" and indicated that he would continue his campaign until at least the Florida primary, the latest primary that he has qualified for the ballot, on March 19, 2024.Burgum also went on to claim that his lack of presence at the debate was the reason viewership declined by millions from the second debate.\nOn 7 November 2023,New HampshiregovernorChris Sununucalled on Burgum, alongsideAsa Hutchinsonto drop out of the race stating that the two have no path to victory.In response Burgum wrote anop-edin theJamestown Sundefending his campaign, arguing that he is the underdog candidate, and that his campaign reflects his own underdog story of founding a tech company in the great plains and winning the 2016 gubernatorial primary after being down 59%. Burgum then touted his economic reforms in North Dakota and criticized Joe Biden's foreign policy concluding that the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire determine the nominee, not theRepublican National Convention(RNC).\nOn 10 November 2023, theNorth Dakota News Cooperative(NDNC) submitted a poll of Republicans in North Dakota and found that Burgum came in third place with 12% of the vote, behind Ron DeSantis at 14% and Donald Trump with a commanding 54% lead.The Forum of Fargo-Moorheadconcluded that this shows that Burgum's disconnect with the voters isn't his lack of name recognition, which he has more than enough of in North Dakota, but rather that fundamentally his message is out of touch with Republicans and that Burgum should drop out of the race.Shortly after, on 13 November, theNational Reviewalso called on Burgum to suspend his campaign, alongsideChris Christieciting the departure ofMike PenceandTim Scott, alongside his lack of national recognition, however,National Reviewalso noted that Burgum is running with the intention to win, which they called \"delusional.\"\nAfter the NDNC poll and his op-ed on November 12, Burgum announced that he would continue his campaign until at least the New Hampshire primary on January 23.Shortly after on 14 November, Burgum announced he would perform a five-day campaign swing in Iowa.Despite this, two days before the fourth Republican national debate on December 4, 2023, Burgum announced the suspension of his campaign due to the lack of movement in the polls and his failure to quality for the fourth debate.\n### Future\nBurgum previously announced that he would not accept a position in Donald Trump's cabinet should he win the 2024 election, instead stating that he plans on returning to the private sector after his term as governor expires.\nOn January 14, 2024, Burgum endorsed former PresidentDonald Trumpfor President.\n", "Burgum's campaign had been notably able to garner large amounts of funds, raising $15.2 million by October 20, despite his low presence in the polls. This was thanks to a series of ultra-wealthy donors backing Burgum, including:First International BankCEOSteve Stenehjem, actorJosh Duhamel,New York JetslinemanConnor McGovern,Coca-ColaCEOJ.

Burgum was also supported by a series ofSuperPACs, namely those created by SenatorsJohn HoevenandKevin Cramer, as well asThe Minn-Dak Farmers CooperativePAC, theNorth Dakota Petroleum CouncilPAC, and the pro-CoalLignite Energy CouncilPAC.\nBurgum's campaign was also largely self funded.Forbesestimated that his net worth at the start of his campaign to be ~$100 million, making him the third wealthiest candidate behind just Donald Trump and Vivek Ramaswamy, who are both billionaires. However, most of Burgum's net worth is held in family trusts and Microsoft stock and is not necessarily cash-on-hand. As of November 8, 2023, Burgum has spent more than $12 million on his presidential campaign.\n", "### Energy\n#### Energy independence\nBurgum stated that the issue of Americanenergy independenceis an issue of national security.

sought to assuage concerns of an overcrowded 2024 primary field which now boasts 12 highprofile gop contenders i dont think a dozen candidates is too many competition is great for america its great for any industry and its great for the republican party and its great for our voters to have choices the north dakota governor told cnns dana bash on state of the union burgum entered the republican race earlier this month with considerably less name recognition than others vying for the gop nomination with more established candidates such as former president donald trump and florida gov ron desantis drawing national headlines burgum has so far struggled to register in the polls he tried to distinguish himself sunday from his primary rivals touting his midwestern origins one of the differentiators is when i grew up in a teeny little town in north dakota working on the farm working on the ranch working at the grain elevator even working as a chimney sweep to pay my way through college he said ron desantis governor of florida speaks during the road to majoritys faith and freedom policy conference in washington dc us on friday june 23 2023 the conference is the largest public policy gathering of conservative and christian activists in the nation that will feature over 70 speakers and an estimated 3000 attendees according to the organizers photographer al dragobloomberg via getty images al dragobloomberggetty images ron desantis is campaigning on his record judges keep saying its unconstitutional having a president who understands what american workers have to do to deal with the inflation with the high energy costs of the biden administration  that makes a difference burgum said before his election as north dakota governor in 2016 burgum led the company great plains software which was later acquired by microsoft where he then worked as a senior vice president he went on to found real estate development firm kilbourne group and cofound the venture capital firm arthur ventures as someone whos  built global businesses and been a governor i have got some unique strengths the only person thats ever worked in technology and of course technology is  changing every job every company and every industry he told bash turning to the issue of abortion which has quickly become a defining issue in the republican primary burgum reiterated his view that abortion policy should be determined at the state level the constitution defines what the limited role for the federal government is he said america is super diverse and we need to make sure the federal government stays focused on its role former vice president mike pence has called on his fellow 2024 contenders to back a federal ban on the procedure at 15 weeks and trump said saturday at a conservative policy conference in washington that the federal government had a vital role to play in restricting abortion but he did not specify what kind of federal legislation he would push for or support if he were president again asked by bash about trumps call for a federal role burgum said i believe strongly that the federal government overreaches in so many different areas i support the

late monday that seven candidates are set to participate in the second debate  down one from their first clash florida gov ron desantis former south carolina gov nikki haley south carolina sen tim scott entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy former vice president mike pence former new jersey gov chris christie and north dakota gov doug burgum met the rncs heightened polling and fundraising standards for wednesdays debate the party announced former arkansas gov asa hutchinson who appeared in the first republican presidential primary debate did not former president donald trump the frontrunner for the 2024 gop nomination is skipping the event the debate at 9 pm et wednesday and hosted by fox business network and univision is taking place at the ronald reagan presidential library in simi valley california however it could be overshadowed by a separate showdown in michigan  where president joe biden and trump are both traveling this week trump also skipped the first debate and has suggested he could bypass them all on monday he called the republican primary debates stupid basically its a job interview you look at the debates its a job interview and so far im not too interested trump said during a stop at a campaign field office in summerville south carolina ahead of a rally in the area biden is set to visit michigan on tuesday to join the picket line with striking auto union workers trump will travel there the following day for a primetime detroitarea speech at which auto workers are expected to be among those in attendance the former presidents trip to michigan comes amid his busiest stretch of campaigning since launching his bid for a second white house term last fall but his decision to skip another debate has turned the simi valley event into in many ways a battle for the secondplace spot in a gop primary in which trump remains dominant in national and early state polling new polls released over the weekend from nbc news and the washington postabc news found trump with a clear nationwide lead in the gop primary nbc showed the former president with 59 support ahead of desantis at 16 haley at 7 pence and christie at 4 each scott at 3 and ramaswamy at 2 the postabc poll put trumps support at 54 support to desantis 15 with haley receiving 7 pence 6 scott 4 and christie and ramaswamy at 3 each to qualify for the second debate gop candidates had to register at least 3 in two national polls or one national poll and two polls from separate early voting states  iowa new hampshire south carolina or nevada those polls had to be released at least 48 hours prior to the debate and meet the rncs standards candidates were also required to have a minimum of 50000 unique donors with at least 200 donors in 20 states or territories debate participants will also need to sign a pledge committing to supporting the eventual republican nominee hutchinson calling into cnns the source on monday night following the announcement said were not gonna let everything be dictated by the standards set by the rnc and so were excited to continue this week i know that theres gonna be those that says we ought to step aside but whenever you look at the role that iowa and new hampshire plays were gonna continue to compete there and measure it based upon the response we get in those states he told cnns kaitlan collins looking for a breakthrough the smaller stage could mean more opportunities for a breakthrough in the race for the candidates who are set to participate ramaswamy was a dominant figure at the first debate engaging in memorable clashes with pence christie and haley his exchange with haley over russias invasion of ukraine in which the former us ambassador to the united nations advocated a strong us role on the international stage proved to be a key moment that injected new momentum into haleys campaign scott meanwhile has proved to be formidable fundraiser but struggled to make his mark in the first debate his campaign in an email to supporters this week compared scotts optimistic approach on the presidential trail to reagan tim can remember being a freshman in high school when jimmy carter was president those really were dark days there was high inflation crushing interest rates and no economic growth doesnt that sound familiar the email said scott and pence have also sought to highlight differences with other gop contenders over abortion with both pointing to their support for a federal abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy pence last week said on fox business that trump was walking away from our commitment to the sanctity of human life his comment followed trumps interview with nbcs meet the press in which the former president criticized states like florida and iowa that have enacted sixweek abortion bans and sought to position himself as someone who could negotiate a compromise on the issue with both sides christie  whose campaign has largely revolved around his opposition to trump as the gops leader  has ramped up his public criticism of ramaswamy since the pair engaged in contentious exchanges at the first debate but he denied that his jabs at ramaswamy were part of any larger strategy telling reporters its just that hes too easy to go after christie has slammed trumps absence from the stage as disrespectful to voters and has vowed to not let him off the hook after the second debate i have to go out and find him the former governor said in a predebate memo to donors and supporters desantis campaign manager james uthmeier framed the florida governor as the only candidate that can beat both joe biden and donald trump uthmeier argued that the desantis campaign is the only one built for the long haul in terms of resources and organization and that when pressed the media and dc politicians privately admit to this ramaswamy said on fox news over the weekend that his campaign was entering a new phase ahead of the upcoming debate at which he expects to stress the policies and positions he wants to implement as president ramaswamy has given two major policy speeches this month focused on reducing the scope of the federal bureaucracy and combatting chinas influence on the us economy haley said on fox business last week that holding more than 85 rallies in iowa and new hampshire was how she has prepared for the debate we let them ask any question we stay there we shake every hand im the last person to leave she said thats the best debate prep you can get because they pepper you with questions all the time and you get to listen to what they care about and i get to

led to one of the debate moderators threatening to cut his microphone he later expressed frustration over the limited speaking time telling cnn i had to fight my way in throughout the campaign burgum avoided criticizing donald trump who remains the frontrunner for the 2024 gop nomination or commenting on the former presidents legal troubles burgum previously told cnn that he would not consider serving as a running mate for trump or in a future trump cabinet happy to do lots of other things i hadafabulous 30 years in the private sector a lot of opportunities there he saidin august he did not endorse a candidate for president in his statement announcing hes ending his bid burgum who won a second term as north dakota governor in 2020 with nearly 66 of the vote is eligible to seek a third

holding out hope voters in early primary states like iowa and new hampshire couldpropel his longshot bid for presidentnew hampshire picks presidents not pollsters and pundits burgum told a sparse crowd of granite state voters at a town hall hosted by the usa today network last week referencing the impactof the states traditional firstinthenation primaryfive out of seven republican nominees since 1976 won the new hampshire primary including former presidents ronald reagan george hw bush and donald trump youre the tip of the spear of america actually making a decision of whos the person for this moment burgum said so far however the governor has failed to make a mark on voters in the state a recent suffolk universityboston globeusa today new hampshire poll found burgum tied with former vice president mike pence and exarkansas gov asa hutchinson at 1 the story is much the same around the country a morning consult survey conducted between oct 1315 found burgum in last place in the race behind hutchinson and south carolina sen tim scottwith just three months to go until voters begin casting their ballots in primaries heres a look at the appeals burgummade to new hampshire voters that could impact americans across the country prioritizing addiction and mental healththe addiction and mental health epidemic is deeply personal for burgum and is among the toppriorities he would tackle as president he told voters at the town hallfor america to reach its full potential weve got to have a healthy population burgum saidfirst and foremost he believes addiction is the root cause of problems plaguing american communities from homelessness to crime and must be treated as a health care issuethats why he supports rethinking reimbursement systems for mental health care and is calling on the private sector to get involved in funding solutions for substance use disorders burgums drive to address addiction across the country has also bled into his approach to the criminal justice system in north dakota his administration hasstarted treating prisons more like health care facilities that provide some incarcerated individuals the substance use disordertreatment they need to rejoin their communitiesthis is not a republican problem its not a democrat problem addiction doesnt discriminate burgum told town hall attendees if theres one bipartisan issue its that we have to address thisthat perspective is largely shaped by his experience supporting his wife katherine burgum who fought alcohol abuse for close to three decades and has been in recovery for the last two the north dakota first lady started the nonprofit recovery reinvented which aims to end stigma around addiction in the stateincreasing us energy independence as governor of the thirdlargest crude oilproducing state energy is another one of burgums favorite topics a focus on display in new hampshire where he continued to link the issue to national securityrepeating statements hes made previously on the campaign trail the arthur north dakota native derided what he described as a fullon assault of liquid fuels in this country by the biden administration and criticized the movement toward electric vehicles for increasing us reliance on chinesemade car batteriesto ensure us energy independence he contended that the us bureau of land management should allow energyrelated activities such as rare earth metal mining and oil and natural gas drilling on the over 240 million acres of land it administers that land belongs to all of you it does not belong to a few unelected bureaucrats that are coming up with rules saying that it cant be touched burgum said in new hampshirethe governor previously opposed an effort by biden to prevent oil and gas leasing on public lands that was suspended earlier this year by a us district court creating a path toward carbon neutrality however burgum cautioned that his energy stances shouldnt be mistaken as antienvironmentalistif you care about the environment then we should be supporting energy policies where we produce every drop of energy we can in the united states he insistedin particular the governor touted north dakotas pledge to become carbonneutral by 2030 andargued that the state would reach the goal not with mandates or regulations but by leaning on renewable energy sources and innovations to decarbonize fossil fuels if elected president burgum suggested he would roll back regulations in the oil and gas industries but still support clean energy projects for instancehe vowed to eliminategovernment permitting requirements he said were preventing a natural gas pipeline from being constructed between pennsylvania and new england facebook twitter emailshare your feedback to help improve our sitehelpterms of

questions that remain by center for rural affairs on march 16 2022 policy update feb 21 2023 an updated series on pipelines has been published on our blog 1 lawmakers in iowa south dakota introduce pipeline legislation 2 who regulates carbon pipelines 3 to be published feb 27 by nick summers former staff member pipeline proposals can be contentious when economic environmental and landowner interests are at odds with three proposed pipelines intended to facilitate carbon capture and storage across the upper midwest it is important there is an understanding of the facts as well as the relevant questions and concerns surrounding the projects proposed to cross six states from minnesota south dakota iowa and nebraska to illinois and north dakota the pipelines would transport carbon dioxide captured from the emissions of ethanol plants and other similar facilities before being stored deep underground in illinois and north dakota the midwest carbon express proposed by alden iowabased summit carbon solutions and heartland greenway by navigator co2 ventures a dallas texasbased company will have the ability to reduce annual carbon emissions by 12 and 15 million tons of co2 respectively the equivalent of taking 26 and 32 million cars off the road according to company officialsa third pipeline proposed by archerdanielsmidland co a company headquartered in chicago illinois and wolf carbon solutions an affiliate of wolf midstream a company out of calgary alberta would capture emissions from adms facilities in clinton county and cedar rapids in iowa and store it at their existing storage site in decatur illinois a joint news release between the companies states that this pipeline would sequester 12 million tons of carbon emissions annually the ethanol industry offers a market to approximately 40 percent of corn produced in the us according to the united states department of agricultures economic research service as well as jobs in the communities where ethanol plants are located while providing state and local tax revenue while recognizing the role the ethanol industry plays in the economic prosperity of many rural communities there are still questions about the lasting benefits of these pipelines the environmental consequences and their lasting impact on rural communities is carbon capture and storage effective at reducing carbon emissions the effectiveness of carbon capture and storage systems at reducing carbon dioxide is in question because the process of capturing transporting and storing carbon as well as constructing the infrastructure required to run a system all produce carbon emissions the emissions generated through this process can significantly offset the carbon captured according to dr mark jacobsen director of the atmosphereenergy program and professor of civil and environmental engineering at stanford university will eminent domain authority be used among concerns raised by rural landowners during a recent public meeting hosted by summit carbon solutions in boone iowa is whether eminent domain authority would be used to obtain the land necessary for constructing and operating the pipelines the company affirmed its desire to negotiate as many voluntary easements as possible and would not speculate on the extent to which eminent domain authority will be used or if they would request it can carbon dioxide be safely stored underground indefinitely carbon dioxide can be stored underground when done correctly according to a report by the international energy agencys greenhouse gas rd programme but there are concerns about the negative effects stored carbon dioxide can have on the geology of the storage site and the surrounding water quality when proper precautions are not taken according to the intergovernmental panel on climate changes report on carbon capture and storage at the public informational meeting in boone summit carbon solutions told local landowners the storage site in north dakota was safe and sufficient for permanent storage but the site will require long term monitoring to ensure there is no environmental degradation or risks to public health and safety how will these projects make money some final questions that remain are how the projects will be structured financially and how they will contribute to the longevity of the ethanol industry the pipelines will be privately funded but summit carbon solutions said during the public meeting they will obtain the 45q federal tax credit a tax credit designed to incentivize investment in carbon capture and storage technologies once operational the company has negotiated agreements that allow them to share in the financial benefits the ethanol plants will get from entering markets that have standards for emissions generated from fuel sources for example california requires all fuel sold in the state to meet its low carbon fuel standard so the ethanol plants need the emissions reductions from the pipeline to enter the market the pipeline allows these ethanol plants to lower their carbon intensity score which quantifies the amount of carbon emitted over the life cycle of the process and sell to consumers in california while shortterm economic benefits that a stronger ethanol industry offers to rural communities in the midwest are clear the longterm economic and environmental consequences
