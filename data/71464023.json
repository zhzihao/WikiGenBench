{"id": 71464023, "key": "Kinahan Organised Crime Group", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinahan%20Organised%20Crime%20Group", "text": "The Kinahan Organised Crime Group (KOCG), also known as the Kinahan Cartel, is a major Irish transnational organised crime syndicate alleged to be the most powerful in Ireland and one of the largest organised crime groups in the world. It is also established in the UK, Spain, and the United Arab Emirates. It was founded by Christy Kinahan in the 1990s. His eldest son Daniel manages the day-to-day operations of the family's criminal group. Estimated reports have credited them with wealth of up to €1 billion.\n\nThe Kinahan Cartel has had an ongoing feud with the Hutch Gang since 2015, which had resulted in 18 deaths by August 2021.\n\nBackground\nThe Kinahan Organised Crime Group was founded by Christy Kinahan in the late 1990s and early 2000s while Ireland's \"Celtic Tiger\" period  of rapid economic growth was occurring. A native Dubliner, Kinahan's first convictions date back to the late 1970s and involved house breaking, car theft, burglary, handling stolen goods and forgery. The group reportedly began as a street gang of inner-city drug dealers in Dublin, but soon grew on a global scale to become the current multi-million dollar criminal network that it is today. Christy Kinahan served as the direct leader of the organisation up until the position was passed on to his son Daniel Kinahan. Since then, Irish courts have concluded that the group is a murderous organisation involved in the international trafficking of drugs and firearms.\n\nOn 12 April 2022, the United States Department of State announced the offering of rewards of up to 5 million under the Narcotics Rewards Program for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Kinahan family members. The reward is offered jointly with the Garda Síochána, National Crime Agency, and Drug Enforcement Administration. The seven key members were named as: Daniel Kinahan; Christopher Kinahan; Christopher Kinahan Jnr; veteran Dublin-born criminal Bernard Clancy; Daniel Kinahan’s “advisor and closest confidant\" Sean McGovern; former KOCG enforcer now Marbella-based money launderer \"Johnny Cash\" Morrissey; and Ian Dixon who was arrested over the 2015 Costa del Sol murder of Gary Hutch but never charged.\n\nDespite the sanctions being imposed on the group, it was reported in August 2022 that Spanish-based associates of the Kinahan cartel were continuing to operate multi-million-euro drug shipments. \"Johnny Cash\" Morrissey and his wife Nicola were arrested in Marbella, Spain on Monday 13 September 2022.\n\nIn February 2023, a raid on a business in the Long Mile Road area of Dublin led to the seizure of equipment, the arrest of eight people and 40 kg of cocaine. Over 2,000 containers of nitric oxide were seized, as well as €78,000 in cash, a hydraulic drugs press, communications devices, mixing agent and a money counter. Two of those arrested were later released.\n\nIn 2023 Edin Gačanin, who is involved in organized crime in Bosnia and Herzegovina was sanctioned by the US who cited \"close links\" to Daniel Kinahan after broken encrypted chats show how the Kinahan cartel was involved in €350m coke plot. The US named Daniel Kinahan, his father Christy Kinahan Snr and Christy Kinahan Jnr as the three key players of the Kinahan gang.\n\nKinahan family and associates\n\nThe Kinahan crime family is primarily involved in the drug trade.\n\nChristy Kinahan – Also known as \"the Dapper Don\", Christy is the founder of the Kinahan crime group.

A boxing promoter, Daniel has worked as an advisor for Tyson Fury.\nChristopher Kinahan (Christy Jnr) – younger son of Christy Kinahan, is wanted by the US Department of State and there is a reward of up to $5 million leading to his arrest and/or conviction for participating in transnational organised crime, namely narcotics trafficking and money laundering.\nImre \"The Butcher\" Arakas – A notorious Estonian hitman, he is known for committing murders in several European countries, such as Estonia, Lithuania, Spain and Ireland, in addition to having killed dozens of members of the Russian Mafia.\nDeclan \"Mr Nobody\" Brady – One of Daniel Kinahan's closest associates, he holds some of the most important positions within the gang: he is the main logistics man and quartermaster of the Kinahans, being primarily responsible for the gang's weapons depot and for their safety as a result.\nRoss Browning - A native of Dublin, Ireland, he is one of the Kinahan family's top lieutenants. Considered Daniel Kinahan's right-hand man, he has been responsible for the operations of the Kinahan crime syndicate in Ireland for over two decades and as a result, he has become a priority target for the Gardaí and the CAB due to his proximity to Daniel Kinahan.\nLiam Byrne – A notorious and dangerous Dublin gangster, he is a high-ranking member of the Kinahan Family. He comes from a criminal family led by his father James Byrne (who was an associate of notorious Irish gangster Martin \"The General\" Cahill) and is the older brother of David Byrne, an associate of the Kinahan Family who was murdered on 5 February 2016 at the Regency Hotel in Whitehall, Dublin.\nTrevor Byrne - currently serving 17.5 years in jail for firearms offences and robbery is suspected of being a gunman in the murder of Eddie Hutch.\nLee Canavan - convicted of the 2016 murder of David Douglas along with Freddie Thompson, and given a mandatory life sentence.

He has managed communications on behalf of Daniel Kinahan and sells multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine.\nJohn Francis \"Johnny Cash\" Morrissey – Manchester, England-born former Cork restaurateur, Morrissey worked as an enforcer before fleeing Ireland in the early 2000s after reportedly being involved in a bid to harm an Irish Criminal Assets Bureau officer. Based in Marbella, Spain ever since, Morrissey allegedly became the KOCG drugs shipping organiser and money launderer. On the morning of Monday 13 September 2022, a combined force of six enforcement agencies led by the Spanish Civil Guard's elite Central Operative Unit, arrested Morrissey at his villa in Marbella - the first of the seven men named by the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in April 2022 to be arrested. Morrissey had gained notoriety from being part of the team publicising his wife Nicola's Scottish-based Nero Drinks Company Ltd, which was thought to be part of Morrissey's €200 million annual money-laundering operation, leading to her arrest as well at the same time.\nCiaran O'Driscoll – A footsoldier for the gang, he has a criminal record that ranges from possession of illegal drugs to attempted murder. Jailed for 11.5 years in 2017.\nPaul Rice – A high-ranking member of the Kinahan family, he is known for being extremely violent and because of this, he is considered a high-value target by other enemy gangs.\nFreddie Thompson – A cousin of Liam Byrne, he was the head of the Dublin branch of the Kinahan gang from 1997 to 2008, when he had to leave Ireland over a feud he had with the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).

synonymous with drugs gun smuggling and murder  but the family themselves have enjoyed an air of invincibility as investigators have failed to bring them in to face chargesor at least they did until recently before the worlds greatest superpower set its sights on the cartel with the aim of delivering a knockout blow image daniel kinahan was targeted by gunmen at the regency hotel in dublin in 2016 in april the us government put up a 5m 38m reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of kinahan or his two sonsthe us treasury also said the irish mob has joined the ranks of the camorra an italian mafia organisation as they imposed sanctions on the cartel in much the same way they have russian oligarchs over the war in ukrainethings are collapsingthe move came after an operation involving irish police and the uks national crime agency and is one of a number of developments that suggests the net is finally tightening around the kinahan empirethings are collapsing very quickly actually says nicola tallant an investigative reporter at sunday world who is a leading expert on the cartelnobody is untouchable and when you see ireland the uk and the united states coming together theres an inevitability to what happens nextthey are being sanctioned and their finances are going to be strangled ultimately their finances will be disrupted to such an extent that they will be dismantled image claire cronin the us ambassador to ireland announced the 5m reward at dublin city hall links to professional boxing and dubaione of the reasons the kinahans have never appeared in an irish court in relation to the cartel is because they allegedly orchestrate its activities from dubai where a glittering skyline hides a dark underbelly of expat criminals operating freely outside the lawireland and dubai have no extradition treaty and so any attempts to drag the kinahans back to their homeland have faileddaniel kinahan who is suspected of taking on the cartels

leave dubai and will possibly flee to omanhowever she believes it is the 5m reward and not the sanctions which will most likely lead to the arrest of the kinahanswhat i have discovered from working within the criminal underworld for so long is that a criminal is only loyal to moneysomebody is going to get that money and that will be the cartels downfallthe mob was dealt a huge blow in march when thomas bomber kavanagh described as the top man for the cartels operation in the uk was jailed for 21 years for importing cocaine and cannabis worth more than 30mif kinahan and his two sons are next

has been responsible for almost 100 of the devastation thats been caused by drugs in the north inner citynot only have we had the drugs weve also had the horror of an international drug cartel

hutch the nephew of gerry the monk hutch who is accused of masterminding the assassination attempt on daniel kinahan in 2016 told mr ring months later that he feared gangsters from the rival cartel

the most notorious gang feud in irish history  responsible for at least 16 deaths and countless other drug crimes  live untouched by the authoritys crackdown this week we got an insight into daniel kinahans own fight to persuade the world he is not a crime boss ireland believes he is over the last seven days the two personas wrangled for top billing  the suspected cocaine baron and the exemplary boxing promoter on thursday it emerged that kinahan had been appointed as a special advisor for a sports company in bahrain but earlier in the week in the special criminal court a detective

the kinahanhutch feud spiralled out of control khk sports announcing the new role described him as an international boxing power broker a statement released by the firm quotes kinahan the first time

sentence hearing advertisement capper withdrew from a plan to murder patrick patsy hutch the special criminal court heard detective superintendent gallagher told the special criminal court today he was satisfied the criminal organisation that targeted hutch was the kinahan gang gallagher said that the criminal gang has a hierarchicalstructure with subcells within which people were allotted specific roles he agreed with counsel for the defence that capper was a foot soldier who had financial problems designed with impeccable attention to detail the system ensured no one cell member could have the requisite information to make any form of deal with authorities should they wish to turn tout what cappers sentence hearing also showed was this cartel is not completely disbanded or collapsed despite successful prosecutions of gang leaders but instead has morphed into another iteration three years ago elite garda units were arresting and charging serious players within the gang daniel fled as the cartel began to crumble initially going to spain before settling in dubai the organised crime gang was then riddled with informants and needed to change what you have now is the emergence of these subcells such as the gucci gang in finglas controlled by a young kinahan footsoldier known as mr flashy owing to his tastes for designer labels these gangs are operating all over the country as well as in spain and the netherlands gang war it has always been the contention of gardaí that daniel kinahan who was present at the 2016 regency hotel boxing weighin was the target of the shooters the war with the hutch gang had effectively began when gary hutch who was working for the kinahan cartel was murdered in spain in september 2015 as he was suspected of being an informant the regency hotel shooting  which left enforcer david byrne dead  was the retaliation the cartel which had been styling itself as a business became embroiled in an allout crime gang war fuelled by pride hatred and a desire for retribution more murders over the next four months of 2016 eddie hutch senior noel duggan martin orourke michael barr and gareth hutch lost their lives orourke was killed

proposed fights in boxing history staged in the middle east iconic boxing promoter bob arum told the irish sun that everyone trusts kinahan and that he has very good connections in recent weeks a

happen gardaí at a murder scene in 2018 leah farrell leah farrell the song called major plans by artist j spades was released on youtube last month it was then shared by a number of mtk boxers in what

millionkildare drugs haulwhen a consignment of his cannabis was found in a commercial premises in co kildare in 2008 it began a chain of events that put his enterprise to its biggest law enforcement test yeton that occasion in february 2008 gardaí searched a warehouse at the back of a house in clongorey co kildare and seized one tonne of cannabisa further 500kg of the drug was seized in a car in kill as part of the same operation bringing the value of the drug seized to 105 millionfour men were arrested at clongorey an industrial estate near newbridge and in a vehicle in killthree firearms were also seized including a rifle with a telescopic sight and silencer a pumpaction shotgun and a single barrel shotguntwo irishmen were convicted for their role in the kildare find and two others who were charged went on the run one is a former league of ireland soccer playerwhen gardaí began looking into the background of the kildare haul a very interesting picture emergedthey found it was linked to a group of irish criminals  led by kinahan  based in malaga and marbella in southern spainthese men had set up small food companies and started importing inexpensive foodstuffs from spainonce they had established a record of having imported shipments of food into small warehouses in ireland on vehicles registered to their company they began smuggling drugs on those food export runsthe property in clongorey included a warehouse with forklift and trucks all being used to move large consignments of drugs quickly around the country once they had entered ireland from spain in trucks on car ferriesonce here the drugs mainly cannabis and cocaine were sold on wholesale in multimillioneuro batches to crime gangs nationwideup to that point in early 2008 kinahan had not aligned himself to any one gang in irelandhe stayed out of gangland feuds here and simply acted as a wholesaler to all of the main players these include key drugs gangs in dublin limerick cork and in the regionsinvestigation moves to ukthe gardas investigation arising from the co kildare cannabis find in february 2008 identified an identical operation run by kinahan in englandit was centred mostly in the greater london area where front companies with vehicles and small warehouses were used to ship in drugs from spainan international investigation led by the garda and supported by the authorities in the uk found the front companies in both jurisdictions were linked to a parent front company in spainall of these companies were controlled by kinahan and those around himinformation supplied by the garda to the london metropolitan police resulted in the seizure in march 2009 of eight semiautomatic firearms four machine guns and ammunition and silencersthe uk police believed the guns originated in spain and were shipped via the front companies the uk police were now as interested in kinahan as the gardaíin spain things began to get serious for kinahan from the time of the kildare drugs find in february 2008indeed in the same month members of the kinahan gang shot dead paddy doyle near marbella he was a 27yearold from dublins north inner city and was a chief suspect for at least three murders committed as part of the crumlindrimnagh gangland feudwhen the spanish police began investigating that killing they quickly realised gardaí were unpicking the background and modus operandi of the same gang it believed shot dead doylecoordinated raids internationallyin may 2010 after more than two years of international investigation into the kinahan gang arising from the kildare cannabis seizure and the doyle murder in spain police forces in a number of european countries moved against the kinahan gang with coordinated surprise raids and arrestsa total of 700 police officers from across europe began to kick in the doors of business outlets and residential properties where the gang leaders including kinahan were sleepingthe investigation focused not only on drugtrafficking but on the moneylaundering and property investments in which kinahan who was arrested at his marbella villa was involvedgardaí believed the gang led by kinahan was not only laundering its own money and buying property for itself but had also acted as a financial services agent for other criminal gangsat the time of the may 2010 raids under operation shovel properties owned by kinahan and his associates were identified across the world and have an estimated combined value of over 150 millionthe properties were mainly residential but include some business interests such as pubs and small retail businessesproperties were traced in ireland spain belgium dubai south african brazil and cyprus a network of solicitors and accountants in all of those jurisdictions have been used to buy propertyhowever while the arrests of kinahan and his associates and the discovery of how so much of his operation worked was billed as a spectacular breakthrough at the time kinahan and his associates were released without chargethe huge investigation was unable to find enough direct evidence to link the key men to specific crimes they could be charged withand in the five years since it has been business as usual under the spanish sun for kinahangary hutch and regency hotelwhen the operation shovel raids were taking place during the last week of may 2010 only one person was arrested in dublin despite a large number of searches therethat suspects name was gary hutch  the dubliner from the north inner city who members of the kinahan gang would fall out with and murder in spain last septemberhutch was 34 years old when he was shot dead beside the pool at an apartment block angel de miraflores near marbella on the costa del solhis murder effectively began a feud between his large group of associates in dublin and members of the kinahan gang in spain and its associates in dublingardai believe fridays attack at the regency hotel in drumcondra north dublin was an attempt by hutchs associates to target members of the kinahan gang who were in dublinthe man shot dead david byrne from crumlin split his time between dublin and spain the gunmen are understood to have targeted himthe another target was kinahans son daniel kinahan who had travelled from spain for the boxing tournament due to take place in dublin on saturday night  the weighin for which was the scene of fridays hotel shootingthe savage and wellplanned nature of the attack essentially puts those loyal to gary hutch at odds with members of the kinahan gang in an allout underworld feudany

yesterdays seizure of nearly 3 million worth of cocaine along with various other cocaine mixing devices and agents represents the latest setback for the kinahan organised crime gang the last 12 months have seen the kocgs business decimated by a network of informants and multiple seizures as well as attention from international police forces the latest action by gardaí gives us an insight into the workings of the gang and according to sources shows how despite the various setbacks the kocg still wields significant influence in ireland the alleged cocaine factory was squirreled away inside a legitimate business off dublins long mile road a hydraulic cocaine press was just one of several processing tools seized by gardaí at the premises a drugs press is a special machine that compresses the cocaine into block form making it easier to conceal and transport the size of the seized blocks has informed gardaí that the facility was not a lowlevel cocaine production point instead gardaí believe that this particular cocaine distribution hub was serving some of the most heavily used routes around ireland but also internationally advertisement eight arrests gardaí said over 2000 canisters of nitric oxide used in the production of cocaine and 78000 in cash was recovered and that eight people were arrested during the raid two people have since been released without charge it is expected that electronic devices seized yesterday will result in significant intelligence for gardaí officers are hoping that the devices will have information about some of the supply routes used by the gang the premises which was raided is a functioning business however gardaí had received intelligence that it had been acting as a front for the kocg for at least six months gardaí are now in the process of establishing whether the business owner had any knowledge of the scale of the operation and if the business or its staff were part of the criminal enterprise the seizure is a reminder that despite overwhelming pressure being put on the kocg it is still a force to be reckoned with according to security sources read next related reads vodka and coke how europol say the kinahan gangs money

the loft of a fake dublin business premises has been sentenced to 11andahalf years imprisonment by the special criminal court declan brady 53 known as mr nobody pleaded guilty at the nonjury court to possessing nine revolvers four semiautomatic pistols a submachine gun an assault rifle and 1355 rounds of ammunition in suspicious circumstances at unit 52 block 503 grants drive greenogue business park rathcoole co dublin brady with an address at the park wolstan abbey celbridge co kildare supervised and was in overall charge of the arsenal according to the threejudge court which sentenced him to 11andahalf years imprisonment with the final year suspended today presiding judge justice paul coffey said the nature and quantity of the firearms ammo and other items warranted an inference that the arsenal was assembled to support and sustain organised crime of the most serious nature he said brady was the principal target of a covert surveillance operation on the day in question following his arrest the weapons were found in the loft of a fake business premises made to look like the irish subsidiary of a legitimate uk haulage firm along with 17 firearms in total justice coffey said two silencers two electronic tracking devices a radio and a glove were found the court heard previously that four loaded revolvers were found ready for imminent use justice coffey said brady was assisted by two other persons who had been dealt with previously jonathan harding 45 of mcneill court sallins co kildare and james walsh 33 with an address at neilstown drive clondalkin dublin 22 were sentenced to 10 years and nine years imprisonment respectively with the final year of each sentence suspended the judge said brady had received instructions from senior criminal figures based abroad to mind the arsenal the fact brady was in overall charge of the cache required the court to fix a headline sentence of 14 years where the maximum available sentence is 14 years justice coffey said the court would reduce the headline sentence to 11andahalf years to take account of the mitigating factors loaded and ready for imminent use brady had pleaded guilty which was timely and valuable notwithstanding the strength of the evidence against him he had no relevant previous convictions and his daughter had been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder which was relevant to sentencing the judge said furthermore a prison governors report indicated that brady was of good behaviour while in custody and was not presenting any difficulties to prison authorities in order to incentivise bradys rehabilitation while in custody justice coffey who sat with judge gerard griffin and judge david mchugh suspended the final year on condition brady enter into a good behaviour bond for the suspended period when asked if he undertook to be so bound brady wearing a grey threepiece suit and tie said i do the sentence was backdated to 24 january 2017 when brady first went into custody he blew a kiss to family members as he was lead into custody at last months sentence hearing detective inspector noel browne of the national drugs and organized crime bureau told the court that gardaí
