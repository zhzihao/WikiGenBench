As with other Scottish council elections, it was held using single transferable vote (STV) – a form of proportional representation – in which multiple candidates are elected in each ward and voters rank candidates in order of preference.\n\nFor the second consecutive election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) were returned as the largest party with 12 seats – one more than in 2017 but seven short of an overall majority. The Conservatives solidified the gains they had made at the previous election and increased their number by one to return 10 councillors and become the second-largest group on the council. The number of independent councillors fell by almost one third to seven while the Liberal Democrats lost one seat to return four councillors. The remaining two seats were won by Labour and the Greens.\n\nNew ward boundaries were proposed by Boundaries Scotland in 2021 which would have reduced the total number of councillors to 34, however these were rejected by the Scottish Parliament and the boundaries used at the previous election remained in place.\n\nThe incumbent Conservative-Liberal Democrat-independent coalition – known as The Argyll, Lomond and Islands group (TALIG) – retained control of the council with Cllr Robin Currie re-elected as council leader and Maurice Corry elected as Provost.\n\nBackground\n\nPrevious election\n\nAt the previous election in 2017, the Scottish National Party (SNP) became the largest party despite losing two seats, overtaking the number of independents which fell by five. A coalition of independents, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats retained control of the council after the Conservatives made five gains and the Liberal Democrats increased their number by two.\n\nSource:\n\nElectoral system\nThe election used the eight wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 28 councillors being elected. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the single transferable vote (STV) electoral system – a form of proportional representation – where candidates are ranked in order of preference.\n\nComposition\nAfter the 2017 election, a few changes in the composition of the council happened. Changes in the political affiliation of councillors occurred when Conservative councillor Alastair Redman was suspended over Islamophobia allegations and independent councillor Roddy McCuish joined the Independence for Scotland Party. In the run-up to the election, Conservative councillors Donald Kelly and Jamie McGrigor were deselected by the party but continued on as independents. Cllr McGrigor was subsequently expelled by the party for standing as an independent. Three by-elections were held and resulted in an independent hold, a Conservative gain from the Lib Dems and a Conservative hold.\n\nRetiring councillors\n\nSource:\n\nProposed boundary changes\nFollowing the passing of the Islands (Scotland) Act 2018, a review of the boundaries was undertaken in North Ayrshire, Argyll and Bute, Highland, Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar. The Act allowed single- or two-member wards to be created to provide better representation of island communities. New ward boundaries were proposed by Boundaries Scotland in 2021 which would have increased the number of wards by one to 12 but reduced the number of councillors by two to 34. Two new two-member, island-only wards would have been created to represent Islay, Jura and Colonsay and Mull, Iona, Coll and Tiree. As a result, the Kintyre peninsula would have been represented by a single ward instead of multiple wards which cover a mix of mainland and island communities.\n\nThe proposals would have made no changes to the boundaries or numbers of councillors in Cowal; Dunoon and Lomond North. The boundaries in Isle of Bute would have remained the same but the number of councillors would have been reduced from three to two. Minimal changes would have been made to the boundaries of Helensburgh Central and Helensburgh and Lomond South but the number of councillors in Helensburgh Central would have been reduced by one from four to three. Oban would have been placed in its own ward with four members and a new two-member Lorn ward including the inhabited island of Lismore would have been created. However, the proposals in Argyll and Bute were rejected by the Scottish Parliament and the 11 wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004 remained in place.\n\nCandidates\nThe total number of candidates increased from 77 in 2017 to 79. The number of independent candidates – 25 – outstripped any individual party but fell by four from the previous election. The SNP and Conservatives both stood 13 candidates; more than any other party. The SNP's total was a reduction of three from the previous election whereas the Conservatives increased their number by two. Both the Liberal Democrats and Labour increased their number of candidates by one from the previous election – standing 11 and eight respectively – while the Greens stood five candidates, two more than five years previous. For the first time, the Independence for Scotland Party (ISP) (two), the Scottish Family Party (one) and the Alba Party (one) fielded candidates in an Argyll and Bute election. Unlike the 2017 election, the UK Independence Party (UKIP) did not field any candidates.\n\nResults\n\nWard summary\n\n|- class=\"unsortable\" align=\"centre\"\n!rowspan=2 align=\"left\"|Ward\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n! %\n!Cllrs\n!rowspan=2|TotalCllrs\n|- class=\"unsortable\" align=\"center\"\n!colspan=2|SNP\n!colspan=2|Ind\n!colspan=2|Con\n!colspan=2|Lib Dem\n!colspan=2|Lab\n!colspan=2|Green\n!colspan=2|Others\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|South Kintyre\n|32.8\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|35.9\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|22.5\n|1\n|8.7\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|colspan=\"2\" \n|colspan=\"2\" \n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Kintyre and the Islands\n|29.9\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|39.9\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|9.6\n|0\n|16.4\n|1\n|4.2\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|colspan=\"2\" \n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Mid Argyll\n|31.2\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|46.6\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|11.6\n|1\n|3.3\n|0\n|4.9\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|2.4\n|0\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Oban South and the Isles\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|38.2\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|2\n|29.8\n|1\n|12.4\n|1\n|5.2\n|0\n|4.7\n|0\n|9.7\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Oban North and Lorn\n|30.6\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|31.6\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|18.7\n|1\n|6.5\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|9.7\n|1\n|2.9\n|0\n|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Cowal\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|41.9\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|1\n|5.2\n|0\n|26.1\n|1\n|16.8\n|1\n|7.7\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|2.4\n|0\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Dunoon\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|40.9\n|bgcolor=\"#efe146\"|1\n|16.2\n|0\n|17.9\n|1\n|16.9\n|1\n|6.5\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|1.6\n|0\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Isle of Bute\n|25.4\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|46.1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|17.8\n|1\n|1.1\n|0\n|4.3\n|0\n|3.0\n|0\n|2.4\n|0\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Lomond North\n|24.3\n|1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|34.1\n|bgcolor=\"#c0c0c0\"|1\n|26.4\n|1\n|2.8\n|0\n|12.4\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|colspan=\"2\" \n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Helensburgh Central\n|21.4\n|1\n|2.2\n|0\n|bgcolor=\"#add8e6\"|37.1\n|bgcolor=\"#add8e6\"|1\n|11.1\n|1\n|21.3\n|1\n|6.8\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Helensburgh and Lomond South\n|26.0\n|1\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|bgcolor=\"#add8e6\"|47.7\n|bgcolor=\"#add8e6\"|1\n|17.8\n|1\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|8.6\n|0\n|colspan=\"2\" \n|3\n|- class=\"unsortable\" class=\"sortbottom\"\n!align=\"left\"| Total\n!31.0\n!12\n!25.3\n!7\n!22.7\n!10\n!9.6\n!5\n!6.4\n!1\n!3.9\n!1\n!1.1\n!0\n!36\n|}\n\nSeats changing hands\nBelow is a list of seats which elected a different party or parties from 2017 in order to highlight the change in the political composition of the council from the previous election.
