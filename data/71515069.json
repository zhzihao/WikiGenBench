{"id": 71515069, "key": "Modern education in Ethiopia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern%20education%20in%20Ethiopia", "text": "Modern education in Ethiopia introduced by Emperor Menelik II, who first opened the government school named Menelik II School in 1908 with proclamation issued in 1906. Despite being progressive, the modern education met with opposition from clergy and priests from Orthodox church, primarily the Coptic Orthodox. By 1913, provincial schools were expanded to Harar, Dessie and Ankober.\n\nThe opposition decreased by 1920s and subsequently Emperor Haile Selassie opened Teferi Mekonnen School and made hallmark of modern education since 1930. Haile Selassie helped to establish Ministry of Education and introduced European schools; French, Arabic, and Italian and English became predominant instructions during the era. American advisor Ernest Work introduced the first educational cycle consisted of 6 years of primary, 6 years of secondary, and 4 years university education.\n\nDuring the Derg regime, new education policy enacted embracing socialist ideology and chartered by the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) in 1976, further elaborated five volume policy documents known as General Directives of Ethiopian Education produced by the Ministry of Education in 1980. The literacy rate was increased by this era compared to Haile Selassie regime, enrollment increased from 224,934 in 1959–1960 to 1,042,900 in 1974–1975, about 15% per annum.\n\nFrom Menelik to Zewditu\n\nModern education in Ethiopia was commenced after the reign of Emperor Menelik II, who then opened the first school, Menelik II School, in 1908. Before that, he issued a proclamation in 1906 that reads:\nIn other countries, not only do the younger citizens learn, they make new things even more. Hence, as of today, all six-year-old boys and girls in Ethiopia should attend school. As for parents who would not send their children to school, when the former die, their wealth, instead of passing to children, will be transferred to the government. My government will prepare the schools and avail itself of the teachers.The proclamation gave legitimacy through the force of law. First, the emperor wants to drive new change to the country via expanding education. Second was related to gender equality where the past traditional educational scheme excluded female students with large domain of males.\n\nOverall, this was not achieved Menelik's goal. By the time of Menelik's death in 1913, there were three schools established in provincial center: in Harar, Dessie, and Ankober. Although the attendance was free in school, it was not attracted by people nor the youth, mainly due to influence of the clergy. Menelik II itself had problems in early history while embracing a more secular and modern system of education. By that time, there were 100 students enrolled in the school, mainly the sons of nobles of chiefs, and the nobles tended to tradition, and began to send the children of their servants or members of the extended family.\n\nLater on, there was need for modern public education in the early beginning of the twentieth century, with absence of Church and Quran education to satisfy the demands or needs of political, economic, foreign relations, maintaining the sovereignty of the country. This was influenced by centralized government since 19th century and Ethiopia's strong diplomatic ties with other world, the Franco-Ethiopian Railway and the introduction of infrastructure. European languages such as French, Italian, English as well as native language Amharic dominated the curriculum to the field like mathematics, science, physical training, and sports.\n\nThe main curriculum was brought from France, which routinely promoted the natives to learn French language and highly assimilated through the course. Menelik also faced opposition from church leaders in Coptic Orthodox at Alexandria and Syria for introducing modern type education, which believed to promote anti-Ethiopian attitude particularly for introducing foreign education. As response to opposition, the curriculum included Ge'ez course that included writing and reading.\n\nBy the 1920s, the opposition to modern education came to diminish slightly and Menelik contributed to the growth of non-governmental education. In 1929, Empress Zewditu issued a proclamation that wanted to reverse traditional education. It reads as:\nThose parents who failed to send their children to schools and made them learn reading and writing skills, respecting the empress and God would have to be penalized 50, 50 Ethiopian birr each and the birr collected from such penalties would be given to the respective church and being used to serve the needy people. The baptism priest was also requested to advice his religious children to send their biological children to schools. If they failed to send their children to schools, the priest should inform this to the respective government representatives. The teachers are requested to teach children. Church leaders are also expected to provide life skills advice to its people. Moreover, parents need to initiate their children to learn local skills that could help them to lead their future.\n\nHaile Selassie regime\nSince Emperor Haile Selassie came to power in 1916 and notably in 1930, modern education made hallmark in the Ethiopian history. The second government school was inaugurated named Teferi Mekonnen School and started modern education as of 1925. Like Menelik II, Haile Selassie faced opposition from conservatives while making efforts to open the school, and subsequently halted the project for a couple of years to overcome the opposition.\n\nThere were to main streams of education, French and English, while French has dominated most of instruction. The curriculum was consisting of French, English and Arabic, mathematics, chemistry and physics, history, geography, gymnastics and sport, as well as Amharic. Most of teaching staffs consisted of expatriate teachers such as French and Lebanese while there were also Ethiopian teachers influencing teaching Amharic and elementary French. In 1930, Haile Selassie established the Ministry of Education assuming the crucial role of modern education. During this time, some steps were taken such as allocation of education budget and soldiers should learn writing and reading, and priests should convince themselves to engage tutor youths.\n\nThe American education advisor Ernest Work appointed and contrived education cycle consisting 6 years of primary, 6 years of secondary, and 4 years of university education with high emphasis of teachers education/training and agriculture. From 1930 to 1935, provincial schools and community schools for children of foreigners, a teaching training, and Boy Scouts' school were opened. British-Ethiopian historian Richard Pankhurst noted that the literacy rate was elevated henceforth. During Italian occupation of Ethiopia (1936–1941), formal education was suspended until the state machinery could be reassembled and the school reopened.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1950, educational funded resources became scarce and the growth rate of education slowed down. During the post-liberation period, the British exerted to invest schools, and English became the main curricula for Ethiopian education. It resembled to East African British colonies by textbooks and students were prepared for the London General Certificate Examination (LGCE), which was functional to the Ethiopian education from 1947 to 1958.\n\nThe Derg era\nAfter the Derg came to power in 1974, educational system of Ethiopia merely consisted of socialist ideology and adopted as a new education policy. This view charted by the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) in 1976, further elaborated five volume policy documents known as General Directives of Ethiopian Education produced by the Ministry of Education in 1980. Another aim of education endorsed by the ruling party in 1984 as:\nThe aim of socialist education is to mold citizens who have an all-rounded personality by inculcating the entire society with socialist ideology, thus arming them with the required knowledge for socialist construction. The fundamental aim of education is...to cultivate Marxist-Leninist ideology in the young generation, to develop knowledge in science and technology, in the new culture and the arts, and to integrate and co-ordinate research with production to enable the revolution to move forward and secure productive citizens.In July 1990, 75.3% national literacy rate was reported to the government with national campaign. The rate of expansion of both primary and secondary education was higher than to the previous Haile Selassie regime. Enrollment (including those in private schools) increased from 224,934 in 1959–1960 to 1,042,900 in 1974–1975 or the rate of about 15% per annum. During the period of 1975–1979, enrollment increased from 1,042,900 to 3,926,700 or at the rate of about 12% annually.\n\nDespite significantly growing from the past, there were also problems with shortage of qualified teachers and resources, which resulted in the deterioration of quality of education. In 1983, the Derg adopted a resolution that reads as:\n[t]he formal education sector expanded rapidly after the revolution, but the fact that there are some weaknesses in the quality of education must now be recognized. The content and quality of education must fully prepare students to meet the objective demands of the nation and the ideological needs of society. [S]teps should be taken without delay to implement the program for expansion of technical and vocational education in line with the manpower demands of the country.In response to the resolution, the then Ministry of Education launched a project known as Evaluative Research on the General Education System of Ethiopia (hereafter ERGESE) in 1983, which was completed by 1986. \n\nThe Derg had received criticisms over the education system. For instance, various proposals were made to change the structure of educational system, but not implemented at all while most regular budget (56.8%) were allocated to the military and other activities at the expense of education and other social development issues and activities, and the literacy campaign which was launched in 15 national languages, did not adequately commit the desired goals. The other criticism associated with curriculum undertaking; few authors had study the curriculum affected transitional development.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Historical Upheavals of the Educational Policy Formulation and Implementation in Ethiopia: A Historical Analysis\nEducation in Ethiopia\nHaile Selassie", "unikey": "Modern education in Ethiopia", "summary": "Modern education in Ethiopia introduced by Emperor Menelik II, who first opened the government school named Menelik II School in 1908 with proclamation issued in 1906.

20032004 that number had increased to over 93 million students world bank 2005 however the road to progress has been uneven as the country faces several challenges in her efforts to improve the educational system the beginning of modern education attempting to bring change from traditional models of education to the modern and secular forms was not a simple task for previous secular rulers as there were significant obstacles birhanu and demeke 1995 this was due in part to the conservative attitude of church leaders popes from the egyptian coptic church and the noblemen a modest attempt was made by emperor menelik ii 18891913 to open the first school in his palace teshome 1979 28 pankhrust 1968 676 it was primarily for the sons of the nobility and the fundamental principle that dictated the development of its curriculum was political interest the education policy makers the emperor aristocracy and foreign advisors were interested in the prevailing international order modernizing ethiopia and the training of interpreters for international african nebula issue 5 2012 54 communication zewdie 2000 105 in this respect the aims of education were to contribute to maintaining ethiopias sovereignty emperor menelik ii strongly believed that the building of ethiopia as a modern state as well as the strengthening of existing political power necessitated the introduction of modern education it was believed that the countrys independence could be linked to an educated populace that was fluent in foreign languages consequently the curriculum included such languages as french italian english arabic and amharic birhanu and demeke 1995 observing the shortcomings of traditional schools to meet the demands of the international political atmosphere and feeling a need to advance the nation menelik ii opened the first modern school at addis ababa in 1908 teshome 1979 28 pankhurst 1968 676 it was opened with the objective of educating the young to ensure peace in the country reconstructing the country and enabling ethiopia to exist as a great nation among the comity of nations pankhurst 1976 it was also aimed at producing administrators interpreters and technicians shortly after establishing the school the emperor became aware of its inadequacies and decided to import teachers from abroad however this idea was strongly resisted by the church particularly by abune matewos a church leader who was recruited from the egyptian coptic church the reasons for the opposition of the church to recruiting foreign teachers remain unclear till date perhaps it was based on fears that foreigners might corrupt the churchs traditions to overcome this opposition from matewos the emperor adopted the policy of recruiting teachers from egypt in 1906 ten egyptian teachers were appointed to the newly established schools in different parts of the country seyoum 1996 following the establishment of that first school in the capital attempts were made by the government foreign communities and missionaries to establish modern schools across the country for instance a french community school was opened in the capital in 1908 and another one by alliance francaise in 1912 this period was also known for the expansion of nongovernmental schools in the country between 1906 and 1935 one hundred private schools were opened bender 1976 female education however was in a very poor state many assumed that an educated woman would not look after the house and the husband of the educated woman cannot live long bender 1976 103 with such beliefs it was difficult for the community at large to send their daughters to school it could thus be inferred that during the reign of menelik ii the role of females was relegated to childrearing and household chores as a result women were disadvantaged as regards equal opportunity in education between 1908 and 1935 the aim of education was to master different languages as a result the curriculum was mostly composed of such language courses as french italian geez arabic and amharic additionally some courses in religion mathematics law and calligraphy were offered adane 1993 although menelik ii valued vocational curricula and promoted the growth and development of science and technology a stronger emphasis was placed on languages pankhurst 1974 the ethiopian education system and its curricular components objectives of education contents or courses to be taught organization of a school and its management and the method of african nebula issue 5 2012 55 evaluation were primarily influenced by the french education system the selection and organization of content were determined by the headmasters and teachers from france and french was used in ethiopia as medium of instruction up to 1935 the application of french methods to ethiopian students presented some challenges for instance the assessment methods used during this period were alien to the ethiopians the monarchy had depended on a nonnativeethiopian curriculum which did not consider local peculiarities for example students in most schools were required to sit for the french government examination of competence zewdie 2000 114 consequently the involvement of foreigners particularly the significant numbers of french and egyptian advisors largely affected the selection and organization of the curriculum which did not necessarily address the needs and interests of the ethiopian people though criticized for being conservative and devoting much of her time to religious purposes empress zewditu menelik the daughter and immediate successor of emperor menelik ii is credited for launching universal education to all schoolage children identified by the empress as ages 721 in the amharic language her education proclamation in 1929 stated all those who do not send their sons and daughters to school so that they can learn writing and reading skills which are necessary to identify the good and evils and develop fear of god and the king will be punished 50 birr the money solicited from punishment will be given to the church for the feeding and clothing of the poor   all god fathers should advice their religious followers to send their children to school and if they refuse to do so they have to report to local authorities as they have violated the proclamation  all church leaders in the rural areas apart from their religious preaching should teach reading and writing ayalew 2000 159 empress zewditu also understood the relevance of vocational education which enabled youngsters to secure money for livelihood to this point the proclamation stated after learning writing and reading to secure money for his life the child has to learn one of the handicrafts available in our country ayalew 2000 159 this idea was radical at the time as leatherwork smithing and clay making were considered low caste jobs though the empress promoted her vision to address equity in education through universal primary education to all children in the country there were many obstacles there were not enough schools throughout the country to accommodate all schoolage children moreover the implementation of universal primary education required availability of educational materials and trained professionals both in quantity and quality as teachers school administrators supervisors curriculum planners etc because of these pressing problems it has until recently been difficult to realize universal primary education for all school age children in the country another important event in the expansion of modern education was the advent of the late emperor haile selassie i as regent and heir to the throne in 1916 he was a graduate of the first school established in menelik iis palace he was credited for establishing the first printing press which greatly helped the expansion of modern education through wellorganized textbooks newspapers and other educational materials and works nevertheless ethiopias educational african nebula issue 5 2012 56 system experienced some challenges as the high cost of printing caused shortage of books references textbooks and other educational materials emperor haile selassie opened a new school in his name and empowered the different land lords the notable owners of lands to do the same in various provinces of the country consequently the aristocracy expanded modern schools in different parts of the country the schools were typically named after those who established them to show their political influences teferi mekonen school focused on the teaching of religion mathematics law and calligraphy as a continuation of menelik ii school it was also during this period that the first school for girls was established by empress menen in 1931 this seems to be the first attempt to practice gender equity in education by giving the girls an equal educational opportunity the education system from its inception until the occupation by italian fascists 1935 was criticized for being too european and unable to respond to the actual needs of ethiopian society plagued by a dearth of materials alien curriculum and educational content and untrained and inefficient teachers the educational system was not expected to succeed yigzaw 2005 the ethiopian curriculum was also criticized for the lack of emphasis on vocational education not until the 1930s few schools prepared pupils for technical and professional works through courses related to production one of such schools was lycee haile selassie which offered courses in mathematics physics chemistry civil engineering veterinary science and modern languages another modern school was menen girls school which offered courses in dressmaking drawing home management and physical training after colonization many african leaders and authorities perceived a need for competent wives skilled in modern house management needed to welcome their european visitors at home similarly at the outset menen school focused on providing courses that train girls to be good wives later this school included courses in science and mathematics the schools also have a leadership challenge while policy makers were made up of the aristocrats emperor and foreign advisors there were no supervisors and coordinators at the district level who were responsible for looking after the schools and maintaining channels of communication between the schools and decision makers middletier academic management individuals had to be brought in from elsewhere most of whom were egyptians and french for example egyptians headed menelik ii school whereas teferi mekonen school 1925 and the menen school 1931 had a french headmaster and a french headmistress respectively in general this period 19081935 is characterized by french dominance as teachers and headmasters were not only french examinations were also conducted in french therefore it is referred to as the french period the efforts of the two successive governments to expand modern education in ethiopia hoped by many to be the basis for the countrys development were disrupted by the italian occupation according to seyoum the occupation was short lived however it did a lot of harm 19963 indeed a pronounced bottleneck for the growth of education was created by the italian invasion of ethiopia from 1935 to 1941 the devastating war of aggression and its consequences resulted in a significant and lasting negative effect on the growth and development of education during the italian occupation schools were either closed or used for military camps and the educated few were either eliminated or joined the guerrilla fighters of the country tekeste african nebula issue 5 2012 57 1990 the only school that was opened in the country was that of the catholic mission which emphasized religion the italian language and subservience to the mussolini regime notable improvement of the education system was lacking in this period the major aim of education was to create citizens that would be loyal to italy the content of education focused on reading writing and simple arithmetic semivocational skill training and internalizing fascist values to promote loyalty to the regime moreover they suggested that local administration languages amharic oromipha and tigrigna replace the unified national languages of ethiopia which were used for classroom instruction this decision was not based on the pedagogical principle that instruction in ones mother tongue can help children understand and learn faster and relate what is taught in schools with their immediate environment but rather with the intention to create disunity among the various ethnic groups in the country adane 1993 during the occupation ethiopian teachers who knew the local languages were employed under the supervision of priests and nuns with an emphasis on the socialization of the italian ideology however in practice all instructions in governmentoperated schools were primarily in italian textbooks were written in italian and focused on italian history policies opposed equal opportunity for schooling and implemented rigid discrimination in the schools with different schools used for italians and ethiopians education for ethiopian nationals was restricted up to grade 4 while italians were provided schooling similar to students of their home country during this period there was neither uniform and standardized curriculum nor a standardized assessment method in the schools reconstruction 19411955 the liberation of the country in 1941was accompanied by a period of reconstruction that lasted to the midfifties like that of the previous governments the government of this period also believed that the countrys independence could be assured through its educated citizens as a result the government encouraged the development of education in doing so the ministry of education and fine arts was established in 1942 and the effort to modernize education started all over the country again consequently schools started blossoming in some of the urban centres of the country seyoum 1996 great britain which assisted ethiopia in becoming liberated from italian aggression was interested in the education system of ethiopia accordingly mr erj hussey who had wide experience in africa was appointed as an advisor in the ministry of education in 1942 from 1942 to 1954 the ethiopian education system was highly influenced by the british advisors these advisors greatly influenced the structure of ethiopian education the medium of instruction and the evaluation system zewdie 2000 once again this education system did not reflect the cultural social and economic situation of the country because it was dominated by the british education system therefore this was known as the period of british domination an expatriate educator at that time observed that there was nothing ethiopian in the classroom except the children seyoum 19964 consequently it was difficult for the education system to respond to the needs and problems of the society as indicated previously the fundamental principle which directed the development and implementation of school curriculum until 1952 was the political agenda of the aristocracy and african nebula issue 5 2012 58 their foreign advisors zewdie 2000 after 1953 reforms regarding the involvement and participation of educated ethiopians were put in place human resource development was given due attention in this period which led to the involvement of ethiopians in areas ranging from policymaking to classroom practice the educational expansion was primarily aimed at producing a workforce that could serve in government eventually replacing expatriates with native personnel tekeste 1990 it was important to produce educated people who could fill the modern administration system alongside those who were already there and who had survived the italian war of aggression moreover training of technicians for service sectors like transport and commerce and officers for police and the armed forces was emphasized to meet these needs academic secondary schools and technical and vocational schools were opened furthermore during this time a gradual advancement in curriculum development occurred the first formal written curriculum was published in 194748 it was developed by committees consisting of ethiopians and foreigners of varying nationalities later on the structure of the education system was changed on the basis of the perceived interests of the ruling class after the development of the first curriculum a total of seven revisions were made between 1948 and 1968 in 1953 a long term planning committee under the chairmanship of the vice minister of education and fine arts had recommended that the fundamental principle for developing and implementing school curriculum was a careful assessment of the need and purposes of the people of ethiopia with a particular focus on the cultural social and economic characteristics of the country the period was marked by the development of various curriculum materials initially the structure of the education system was designed to be a threetier 444 system four years of primary intermediate and secondary education by the long term planning committee bekele 1966 in 1947 the first 10 year education plan was drafted and a 664 system six years of primary school six years of junior secondary education four years of senior secondary education was introduced it was in 1947 that the first official elementary school curriculum for grades 16 which covered a wide range of subjects was published it was later improved in 1949 and was extended to include grades 7 and 8 the secondary school curriculum was issued in the same year tesfaye and taylor 1976 the subjects offered at this level were amharic english science art geography history arithmetic music handicraft and physical education amharic was the medium of instruction in grades one and two in grades three and four english was used as a medium of instruction for teaching of art science physical training handicraft music geography history and arithmetic in grade five and six all subjects with the exception of amharic were taught in english ayalew 1964 generally the curriculum was not based on the economic social and cultural realities of ethiopia rather its components were copied from other countries textbooks for primary education were translated from other languages without reflecting the ethiopian situation the secondary school syllabus was based on the london school leaving certificate examination moreover the methods and materials used for classroom instruction were inadequate as there african nebula issue 5 2012 59 was a shortage of textbooks and other teaching aids the bible served as an amharic textbook from grade one to four as a result nonchristian peoples were obliged to follow the bible ayalew 1964 the revised version of the first curriculum otherwise known as the second curriculum became operational from 1949 to 1963 the pattern of school organization was an 84 structure eight years of primary education and four years of secondary education the major reason for the change of curriculum was the need to expand education and alleviate english language deficiencies ayalew 1964 as a result the language of instruction became english starting at grade 4 generally the curriculum continued to be detached from the cultural context of ethiopia it was replicated from great britain and african countries like kenya and sudan from the mid1940s and throughout 1950s students were expected to sit for the general school leaving certificate examination of great britain the practice began to decline with the successive growth of the university college at addis ababa in 1951 by the mid1960s the ethiopian school leaving certificate examination had become the only valid diploma tekeste 1990 with the introduction of 664 school structure in 1963 a national examination was set for evaluating the achievements of students in grades 6 and 8 the national grade 12 test which was introduced in 1954 became the ethiopian school leaving certificate examination eslce at this time the eslce became a test prepared by subject matter experts at the haile selassie i university zewdie 2000 modern education from 1955 to 1972 between 1950 and 1955 there was a gradual reduction of british influence as americans began working in the ministry of education in 1955 the government set up what was known as the long term planning committee the committee focused on the speedy promotion of universal fundamental education as well as the relevance of the curriculum to the needs of the society the american influence on ethiopian education was reflected in new grade structure 624 that was introduced this combination meant that a student had to go through six years of primary two years of junior and four years of senior high school education another significant change made during the time of american influence was the promotion of amharic the medium of instruction at primary school level according to tekeste this change was the most significant reform of the decade 1990 8 and was the first significant attempt made to implement multicultural education in the countrys formal education system this was strengthened by the general agreement for technical cooperation between the governments of ethiopia and united states that marked the dominance of the american education system in ethiopia from 1965 onward as americans began to increase their influence on ethiopias educational system they began to assume headmasterships and teaching positions in schools and started to participate in the process of policy making through the education advisory group zewdie 2000107 this group was involved in the operations of the long term planning committee and in the 1971 education sector review because many perceived foreign involvement in ethiopias educational system to be excessive the government gradually began to ethiopianize the education system initially the government was interested in appointing mostly qualified and experienced ethiopians in the african nebula issue 5 2012 60 process of policy making along with the education advisory group the government also focused on the training of teachers supervisors and school administrators for various community teacher training centres teacher training institutes and the faculty of education hsiu using interviews with a sample of ethiopians in various occupations the education commission conducted a study on the education system in the country in 1962 the results of the study identified the following problems girma et al 1974 a the ethiopian education system lacked a philosophy and its aims and objectives are not properly articulated b curriculum materials teaching methodologies and approaches were based on foreign countries and instructional materials had to be adapted for ethiopians c ethiopian needs in particular with respect to culture and language were not well treated by the education system d the social needs of ethiopian students were not clearly reflected in the curriculum and the goals of education system had been equally hazy e the inequalities in education opportunities in the past had to be evaluated in response to such problems the study generated recommended objectives in the education sector review moe 1972 ii16 1116  to foster a rational and scientific outlook on life to cultivate objectivity intellectual curiosity tolerance and broad mindedness  to replace the traditional negative attitude towards manual work by a positive one  to increase the earning capacity of the individual by providing the relevant skills and knowledge to make people economically selfreliant  to cultivate the desire for lifelong education when formal schooling has been completed  to provide scientific technical and vocational education particularly at secondary level in keeping with the needs of the ethiopian society and economy  to ethiopianize the content of education to make amharic the medium of instruction at the higher level and to give practical orientation to instruction at all levels  to create an integrated society by drawing upon the diverse cultural and linguistic elements and creating the condition for the formation of a truly national culture  to reduce the generation gap between the educated young and the traditionallyoriented old to bridge the gap between school and society  to prepare the nations youth to live in a world community  to equalize access to education among all parts of the country  to provide universal access to education as rapidly as possible to meet these objectives a 444 system with the proposal for basic formation education ie 42 years was approved with the following structure a four years of 14 of minimum formation education to be made available to all children as rapidly as permitted by financial constraint b two years of basic formation for youth who have been unable to attend the minimum formation education mfe programs african nebula issue 5 2012 61 c a four years middle school 58 and four years senior secondary school 912 program for a limited number of graduates of mfe and basic formation program d an extensive system of nonformal educational program for youth and adults which would be closely related to the formal system as can be seen from the proposed objectives the education sector review was an innovative approach to make education more relevant to actual ethiopian culture and needs it was a program designed primarily to integrate education with vocational and environmental education significantly the educational objectives were designed to be free from any form of domination of emperor loyalty and church morals nevertheless strong opposition came out of this proposal from the teachers students and parents because the review suggested a fouryear education for most children and reduced the salaries of certain teachers although the education sector review had its strong as well as weak points one can conclude that it was an important event during this period the study tried to link education with the actual societal activities the study emphasized the importance of universal primary education before the year 2000 the restructuring of the educational system that was recommended was never fully implemented due to strong opposition from various corners of the society some of the oppositions may have been a reaction to the decision to keep the policy document secret from the educated citizens and the public at large the secrecy caused rumours and misinformation which fueled resistance from the society consequently significant measures were not taken to change the fundamental educational principle the third curriculumexperimental curriculum this curriculum which was highly influenced by the americans became operational from 1952 to 1974 it was essentially instigated by a long term planning committee under the chairmanship of the vice minister of education and fine arts american advisors were also members of this committee this committee recommended that the fundamental principles for developing and implementing a national school curriculum must be based on a careful assessment of the needs of the people with respect to cultural social and environmental characteristics in 1957 amharic was chosen to serve as the medium of instruction in the schools the department of research and curriculum development conducted a pilot study on amharic as a medium of instruction prior to nationwide implementation at the end of the pilot program it was concluded that the teachinglearning process had been significantly improved with amharic instruction habtemariam 1970 the fourth curriculum the fourth curriculum was initiated as a result of a pilot project and then implemented after 1963 the school structure was six years of primary education two years of junior secondary education and four years of senior secondary education in this new structure amharic continued as language of instruction at the primary level which was divided into academic and nonacademic components amharic english arithmetic social studies natural science and health and safety subjects were included in academic syllabus the nonacademic subjects were morals agriculture arts and crafts home makings physical training and games and music african nebula issue 5 2012 62 subjects offered in junior secondary schools were history geography mathematics science amharic english and physical education despite the efforts made by the emperor to make education relevant for nationbuilding and modernization the educational reforms of the fourth curriculum did not go far enough to address the educational deficiencies of the country the education system was criticized for being elitist academicoriented and irrelevant to the world of work and for being alien more importantly it was criticized for being urban and malebiased most of the schools were located in a small number of locales such as addis ababa shoa province and asmara in 1974 the enrollment rate of girls in primary and secondary was 32 and 29 percent respectively in 1961 with only 33 percent of the primaryschoolage population and 0 5 percent of secondarylevelschoolage population enrolled in school ethiopia had one of the lowest enrollment rates in africa tekeste 1990 that year at the unescosponsored addis ababa conference of african states a goal was set to provide universal primary education by 1980 ethiopias prospect of achieving this target by 1980 seemed unlikely at the time the problem of trained manpower in the teaching profession in all levels was presumed to be one of the major causes of poor education quality among the challenges was the fact that more than half of the secondary school teachers were foreigners and the training for primary school teachers was conducted in english while the language of instruction in primary schools was amharic in october 1971 government initiated a comprehensive study of the education sector this study which came to be known as the education sector review esr was indeed one of the boldest attempts at educational reform taken by the old regime seyoum 1996 the aims of education sector review were to analyze the education and training system of ethiopia and its capability of promoting economic social and cultural development it also aimed to make education relevant to the society national integration and development and to prioritize studies and investments in education and training the esrs comprehensive review concluded that the education system was too elitist and that it emphasized rote learning and passing of the rigidly set examination and did not provide employable and relevant skills to raise the earning capacity of graduates from these schools moreover the esr concluded that the education system was designed to produce a few intellectuals as only six percent of the total primary school enrollment reached a higher level of education after 12 years its advantages were seen as being limited to those living in urban and industrial areas birhanu and demeke 1995 the esr report presented proposals to be included in the national goals and objectives of education the national goals became the following to speed up economic development of the country so that the living standards of the people would improve to create a society that appreciates its own cultural heritage and would be able to innovate with a strong feeling for modern civilization and to build a generation that was selfreliant and who would be globally competitive tekeste 1990 the objectives of education were to popularize the dignity of work and get rid of the traditional dislike of manual work to produce trained manpower for economic development by teaching science and technology and to make individuals selfreliant by raising their learning capacities african nebula issue 5 2012 63 to realize these objectives certain policyrelated considerations were raised the education system should be developed in such a way that it would be useful and related to lifelong learning therefore education would be linked to agriculture smallscale industry cottage industry commercial enterprises etc education would therefore be integrated with daily living and not remain only theoretical and academic furthermore the report recommended an integrated economic development program as well as the establishment of community skill training centers in various parts of the country in 1972 the council of ministers discussed the policyrelated issues raised by the esr report and accepted them unanimously however certain proposals from the review drew criticisms from teachers and other educators on the grounds that they were allegedly designed to turn the majority of the students into tenants for the landlords under the feudal land tenure system by introducing a fouryear education moe 1984 yusuf cited in birhanu and demeke 1995 pointed out that the major reasons why the esr report was unacceptable was that it failed to consider adequately the socioeconomic and psychological condition of the country it was also noted that the method of study was inappropriate and elitist consequently teachers and students protested against the implementation of the esr recommendations this opposition was presumed to be one of the factors that contributed to the overthrow of the feudal government modern education from 19741991 derg regime the derg regime came to power in 1974 chanting socialism as the fundamental political philosophy of the government marxistleninist philosophy was the central theme that guided the political economic and social life of the country there had been no other time in the ethiopian history that education was conceptualized as an important means to secure political power as a result the curriculum during this period was highly politicized that students were required to take courses in political education tekeste 1990 the education system of the derg regime was influenced by several factors these factors included the strong determination and commitment of the derg government for expanding the communist ideology and the development of curriculum based on the philosophy of eastern european education system consequently the overall education system was aimed towards the attainment of communist ideology this view was articulated through national democratic revolution in 1976 general directives of ethiopian education in 1980 and the guidelines of the working party of ethiopia in 1984 under the derg eastern european governments east germany bulgaria hungary etc served the ethiopian government as policy advisors the central theme of the eastern european socialist ideology was serving better the interests of the masses and enhance its contribution towards the establishment of a socialist society zewdie 2000 79 as a result the education system of the country strongly followed the eastern european educational system and the aims content and materials of education were designed in alignment with socialist principles the fundamental aim of education was to cultivate marxistleninist ideology in the young generation to develop knowledge in science and technology in the new culture and arts and to integrate and coordinate research with production to enable the revolution to move forward and to secure a productive citizenry tekeste 1990 20 these broad objectives were later summarized into three slogans namely education for production for scientific research and for political consciousness african nebula issue 5 2012 64 some specific aims of this educational system were  eradicating illiteracy through the provision of universal education to the public masses  providing schooling to help citizens develop their consciousness participating in class struggle and using the principles of marxism and leninism  enabling students to acquire and own progressive cultures so that they abide by the principles of socialist morality and discipline  providing education that would enhance scientific research and practice so that students would be able to integrate theory with practice know their environment and the society in which they live  providing education that liberates the society from primitive systems of production by producing manpower trained in various professional disciplines it was believed that a student developed by these educational objectives would not have a narrow academic education nor be a producer alone he would be provided with academic and a productive education he would be a humane and productive worker he would not be living on the produce of others nor would he be dependent on others for his livelihood tekeste 1990 20 this statement implies that the schools were supposed to consider the relevance of the curriculum to producing a workforce in the attempt to create a modernized ethiopia to implement these new socialist ideas a task force was set up with the aim of revising the curriculum to align with the new educational goals the new curriculum was referred to as the transitional curriculum general polytechnic education with the aim of producing middlelevel trained manpower was proposed to ameliorate the problem of unemployment of graduates of secondary education however a lack of sufficient financial investment and the downfall of the communist ideology led to the collapse of the programme in the late 1980s birhanu and demeke 1995 the reasons for the failure of polytechnic education were not well documented aside from the governments announcement that the programmme was discontinued due to budgetary problems the pros and cons of the programme were not studied even the schools which were serving as experimental sites did not have the necessary data this period during the times of both the emperor and the derg brought a dramatic increase in enrollment at primary and secondary schools one of the immediate measures taken by the revolutionary regime was to address the issue of primary education accordingly in a policy directive issued on december 20th 1974 it was proclaimed that under the banner of education for all citizens shall have the right to free fundamental education pmac cited in seyoum 1996 on the basis of this declaration the ministry of education took a step to reconcile its educational priorities so as to advance universal primary education within the shortest period of time using the available resources moe 1977 1 to accomplish this educational reform the ministry of education designed a new curriculum developed new textbooks teachers guides and other materials for nearly all subjects and grades of the regular schools the instructional materials were produced in consonance with government guidelines the national democratic revolution programme and later on the workers party of ethiopias programme the 10years economic and social development african nebula issue 5 2012 65 prospective plan and other economic political social and cultural proclamations tekeste 1990 proclamation no 103 of 1976 ensured the public ownership of schools to reconcile the management of schools with the socialist system of ownership however some schools for the children of the politicians and wealthy families remained free from government control consequently there was a difference in the quality of education for upper class and lower class children reflecting the idea that in any society education serves the dominant class ballentine 1997 one of the significant contributions of the derg regime was its launching of a vigorous national campaign against illiteracy in 1979 by july 1990 which marked the eleventh anniversary of the literacy campaign a 753 percent national literacy rate was reported the reduction in illiteracy rate from 95 percent at the start of the ethiopian national literacy campaign enlc to 247 is certainly an outstanding achievement seyoum 1996 in terms of expansion the number of primary schools increased at a high rate in all parts of the country the national enrollment rate reached 341 percent ayalew 1989 the slogan of the ethiopian government was to spread education as much as possible and the nations economic and social development problems would take care of themselves though a quantifiable expansion of the educational system on face value appears to be quite impressive significant problems lie behind the figures firstly it was not possible to make education equitably accessible to all regions in this respect a study by ayalew 1989 41 on regional disparities in primary school participation on ethiopia was quite revealing the southern part of the country received greater educational resources than the northern part secondly the quality of education had gradually started to deteriorate due to a number of factors for example the meagre educational resources had to be thinly spread because of the uncontrolled expansion of schools seyoum 1996 tekeste 1990 most of the literature indicates that educational quality was decreasing as compared with the previous periods seyoum 1996 tekeste 1990 these problems were identified by the derg government including a review of the countrys economic and educational needs the review was primarily aimed at solving the problems created in the employment sector due to rapid expansion of secondary schools to address this concern the government passed a resolution to expand technical and vocational education to meet the employment demands of the country birhanu and demeke 1995 and tekeste 1990 soon after the resolution the moe initiated a project known as the evaluation research on the general education system of ethiopia ergese the evaluation of the education sector was carried out by four committees organized from moe and addis ababa university the study focused on curriculum development and teaching learning process educational administration structure and planning educational logistics supportive services and manpower training and educational evaluation and research tekeste 1990 seyoum 1996 the major findings of the study were  though the syllabus of secondary school subjects reflected the national objectives textbooks do not reflect national educational objectives and they focus on the instruction itself rather than learning dimensions african nebula issue 5 2012 66  the subjects suffer either from lack of clarity coherence and consistency of content or from poor style of presentation  amharic as a medium of instruction in the primary school grade 16 has created difficulties for students whose mother tongue is not amharic  using english as medium of instruction from grades seven twelve created difficulties for both teachers and students  the educational structures namely primary grade 16 junior secondary 78 and senior secondary 912 are not satisfactorily integrated and coordinated  the expansion of the education system is not in accordance with the economic resources and capability of the state  the problem of ethiopian education is a result of poor textbooks lack of instruments and widespread incompetence among teaching staff most of the recommendations forwarded by the ergese were already considered by the ten year national perspective plan 19841994 in 1984 tekeste 1990 consequently the recommendations were not implemented the dergs education system was somewhat inhibited by problems such as budget shortfalls which in turn affected the supply of basic educational materials including textbooks and a shortage of qualified teachers both at primary and secondary schools to resolve the problem of the shortage of qualified teachers the government took an aggressive measure by recruiting 5 500 untrained teachers recruited immediately after the completion of 12 grade it is not difficult to imagine how the huge recruitment of untrained teachers affected the quality of education but this measure has to be seen from its contribution to the expansion of education to the rural part of the country and equal educational opportunity for all to resolve the problem of teachers qualification at elementary level the government designed a summer program lasting over three years to certify teachers this strategy continues to be employed as one of the mechanisms to train teachers at the primary and secondary levels today recommendations for the future paradoxically ethiopias economic development is largely dependent on an educated workforce yet one of the greatest limitations to educational progress is a disadvantaged economy hoot szente tadesse 2006 fortunately the ethiopian government understands the value of education and currently dedicates a significant amount of resources towards its development at all levels recognizing the need for 21st century workers who are skilled in science technology mathematics and engineering stem ethiopian universities are steering students towards these stemrelated degrees the following recommendations are thus offered to help ethiopia develop its most precious resource the ethiopian people in a sustainable way to enhance the quality of life and economic prosperity for all first it is understood that the history of foreign involvement in ethiopias history particularly in the area of education  where curricular decisions selection of instructional languages and cultural considerations  have shaped the evolution of education in ethiopia consequently while foreign investment and aids will likely play an important role in ethiopian education those who are developing the educational system are strongly encouraged to focus primarily on meeting the needs of the ethiopian people with the knowledge and skills necessary to be successful not only in the cultural and political context of east africa but also to prepare ethiopians to be world african nebula issue 5 2012 67 citizens skilled at operating in a global marketplace of commerce and ideas consequently the educational system of ethiopia must simultaneously be culturally relevant and flexibleresponsive this may be accomplished when international nongovernmental organizations ingo partners effectively with local nongovernmental organization lngo osullivan 2006 second ethiopia must invest heavily in teacher training and development an educational system is only as good as its teachers one of the consequences of a rapidly expanding educational mission is the inability to build and maintain instructional capacity ethiopia has a deficit in quality teacher training and continuing education hoot szente and tadesse 2006 it is therefore recommended that the training of teachers should be made a priority there is also a need to increase the use of technology to aid the medium of exchange and communication third gender equity must also be reflected in ethiopias educational system the concept of inclusive education is broad and encompassing not just physical inclusion but also the active participation of all learners hussein 2008 thus the mere presence of girls in schools is necessary but insufficient for gender equality the curriculum and instruction in ethiopia must engage all learners as the system should prepare boys and girls to meet the countrys economic and social needs erulkar and ferede 2009 emphasize the importance of building girls social capital to enhance social outcomes and ethiopian schools would be wise to adopt this approach finally greater effort must be made to provide educational opportunities to students in rural areas naturally this goal is tied to economic and political factors particularly the provision of communication and transportation to connect rural areas and improve accessibility as telecommunication and internet usage increases its reach across the country schools in rural ethiopia will have greater connectivity not only to urban ethiopian schools but also to educational institutions worldwide to address this pressing problem of education there must be an effort to minimize the cost of photocopies computer printing and publishing of textbooks and books references adane t 1996 a historical

education creates an opportunity to be employed in good positions in reducing unemployment scholars debate whether education reduces rural unemployment some scholars argue that education is a powerful weapon to reduce rural unemployment others encounter that education does not necessarily decrease rural unemployment this paper describes the effects of schooling on rural unemployment in ethiopia we used a quantitative approach with a descriptive research design in this study a sample of 8700 participants based on the ethiopian central statistics agency data collected in 2021 was obtained we used descriptive and probit models to analyze the data the descriptive results showed that rural unemployment is unequally distributed based on education sex and regional states the majority are still participating in the agriculture sector besides the finding also reveals that lack of job opportunities training experience and unrelated jobs to education in rural areas is the cause of unemployment however the probit model result shows that schooling has a statistically significant positive effect on employment as a result for a oneunit increase in education the probability of employment increases by 015 it concludes that schooling is paramount in decreasing rural unemployment in ethiopia if much attention is given we recommend that the government should transform rural areas

results revealed that school leaders and teachers perceived preparation for national examination and higher education as the major intent of secondary education they had no adequate understanding of the role of secondary education in preparing students for the world of work the study identified that communication skills teamwork time management independent work ability and readiness to learn and selfmanagement are the competencies employers require from employees who graduated from secondary school however a teachercentered instructional approach that has an insignificant contribution to acquiring the required work skills was the dominant pedagogical strategy employed in the schools thus it is concluded that the space provided to prepare students for work in secondary school

which was inspired more by the desire to further the interests of their adjoining colonies than to help solve the variety of problems which confrontedthe ethiopians he rejected the importation of any complete system european or american and started from the principal that ethiopians must have an ethiopian system or at least one tailored for them whatever the new sources of inspiration he had travelled elsewhere in africa and was critical of the colonial concern for fixing the metropolitan culture upon the subject african i am anxious that ethiopia at least be permitted to develop its culture and in fact be aided in so doings instruction he urged should not even be in a european language alien to all but in amharic which had the advantage of being already a written ethiopian language he was confident that it could be modernized to deal with any subject of instruction by creating an academy to draw on geez for creating a richer and integral vocabulary hethought it worse than wasteful that students should labour over a totally foreign language which gave them access only to a literature about distant lands and peoples he scoffed at the exercise by which ethiopians learned to read about napoleon garibaldi or gladstone depending on whether the pupil had laboured with french italian or english but almost nothing about ethiopia and menelik6 this alien baggage he wished to throw out ethiopian boys and girls should be educated in their own language learn about itbeir own country and men and interesting things as well as the world in general7 i  i i in listing the priorities which had determined his recommendations work placed first the need to use a local languiige and therefore to prepare textbooks in that language and about ethiopia next he set the goal of freeing ethiopian education from reliance on foreign teachers to train a corps of ethiopian teachers he saw no alternative to the founding of a university of ethiopia beginning with a teachers

should give advice only and not encroach on the prerogatives of the director general he saw one of the greatest needs to be the training of ethiopian teachers to take over the existing schools and to staff new ones he objected to foreigners on the grounds of expense and because he thought a new kind of education would gain acceptance more readily if offered by ethiopians themselves he favoured the founding of a university as a means of training this corps of teachers and also because ethiopians would not then have to go abroad in large numbers for long periods of time he was especially critical of the literature he found available to students there is rut present a complete lack of textbooks suited in any way for ethiopia any improvement in education indeed any education 9 southard to state

the emperor of ethiopia and to his excellency sahle sedalou director general of public instruction unsigned undated carbon copy of a typescript in which fulure dates of june july and 1 october 1931 appear i am indebted to dr f watts history dept wooster college wooster ohio and to his african history students for this and the other two unpublished documents cited in this paper they were obtained from the widow of fe work in philadelphia pennsylvania and photocopies are deposited in the institute of ethiopian studies ms collection 5 5 ethiopian journal 0 education viii which would not alienate the student from his environment he warned would require a complete set of especially prepared textbooks in english and french as well as amharic so that they might be used in all schools by allteachers written from the ethiopian point of view with as much good material about ethiopia as can be found standard ethiopian texts were not simply intended to convey knowledge but to assure our students getting to know the same things about their own country and increase unity and patriotism among our people as ijt is our boys are being educated away from ethiopian things and toward europe it is well enough to know about europe but we must not neglect ethiopia this was to be a favorite theme and was closely linked to the question of which system bthiopias schools should be modelled upon no school system he answered flatly in use in a foreign and far distant country however effective it is there should be adopted as a whole in another country where conditions are greatly different but a good schools system should be made to suit the local conditions he concluded his general remarks in this report by the further warning that unless the government could carry out its plans for building good roads rapidly no effective school system could ever be extended beyond the capital in his report work made a series of specific practical suggestions for immediate action to ethiopianize wherever possible existing positions of school director ito require in new contracts that teachers agree to abide by the decisions of their superiors in the ministry ito consult teachers through regular meetings to introduce a standard curriculum even if it proved to be temporary the very next academic year he also recommended thalt standard textbooks be written from the ethiopian point of view and that a teachers training school be established which might gradually grow into a university but its first great work should be to train teachers he concluded by asking for a tenewal of his own contract undertaking to asslst the director general in introducing a standard curriculum and with the help of an assistant to prepare textbooks containing ethiopian material for use during a trial period in english classes he further offered to serve the ethiopian government by going to america to secure money for the teachers training school or university and to recruit americans to each in it rather oddly he also proposed that while employed by the government he give lectures in the usa and write newspaper articles to present the real ethiopia and its hopes and plans in order that american people may become more acquainted wijth ethiopia and become greatly interested in this country the curriculum he promised would be drafted before his current contract expired in any event 6 6 ethiopian journal of education viii a much longer report including a proposed curriculum for elementary chools was duly prepared and presented 13 much space was dedicated to expounding his priorities for reform at greater length it is very much more important he repeated to the ethiopian citizen that he should know the history of his own ooudjtry that he may understand and deal intelligently with his present problems than that he should know all about alexander or napoleon in addition new themes appear the time is at hand when bthiopia must train her own people to take part in the duties and responsibilities of government the businesses and the profes sions it is neither possible nor desireable that an independent country should long continue to have the major part of this work done by foreigners every country to do well must have a great intelligent middle class of business and professional workers in the introduction to his long report work drew attention to the kinds of education training future leaders and a popular mass education he often reverted to his scheme for a teachers training school which he now equated with founding a fouryear university he also projected the establishment of sixyear secondary schools in each province although these were to be vocational as well as feeders for an eventual university despite this topheavy plan work was emphatic when he got to the elementary schools that they were the most important of all because they are for the education of the masses and will be the only school available for the greart majority of the people he qualified such institutions as village or community schools urging that inspired teachers not fine buildings be the precondition for opening many of them and that these local teachers not then be neglected by officials in the ministry in addis ababa there is no more useful individual in any country work affirmed than the well prepared conscientious local teacher such men in the village schools he anticipated would combine skills in gardening and handicra ts with exceptional character and some academic training schools should exist for i1he development of the whole man while he placed great weight on the teachers moral duties in the community he also made a long list of practical skills which the local teacher through the village schools was to diffuse the funotioning of the human body the science of plant and animal life hygiene and sanitation household arts and child care were to be at the centre of the curriculum it seems to me that one of the most unfontunate results of the education thus far 13 a suggested plan for ethiopias school system prepared for his majesty haile sellassie i by f ernest work 57 pp signed carbon copy of a typescript with later 7 annotation 1931 ies ms collection 7 7 ethiopian journal of education viii carried on in ethiopia he added is that it has increased the depreciation of labor  especially for labor with the hands  in the opinion of students rather than having shown them the dignity and importance of laboring with our hands as well as wilth our minds farming and other kinds of hand labor should receive large consideration in our school plan and this he underlined fromthe elementary grades along with academic and business subjects he rounded out his proposal of the subjects to be taught in the whole system by insisting that to listen ito lectures or read about abstract matters should not monopolize teaching at any stage the concrete and definite character of industrial and scientific education is 1 tc1  jt7 1a  jhotj 0 mflt
