The agreement is not a coalition agreement or a confidence and supply, but Plaid Cymru can appoint advisers to offices of the Welsh Government.\n\nIt was announced in November 2021, by the leaders of the two parties, Mark Drakeford, leader of Welsh Labour and First Minister, and Adam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, following months of talks. The agreement was ratified by both parties, voted for by Plaid Cymru's party membership, but criticised by the Welsh Conservatives and some Welsh Labour representatives.\n\nBackground \nSince the establishment of the Senedd, its usual largest party, the Welsh Labour party, has not gained an outright majority in the devolved parliament. To allow past government plans to pass, formal coalition agreements had been agreed, previously with the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru or individual members including Dafydd Elis-Thomas and Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams. Confidence and supply agreements have also been used. The 2021 agreement is not a coalition or supply and confidence agreement, and described by the parties as a \"bespoke agreement\".\n\nPreviously, the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru and Welsh Labour had a coalition agreement, One Wales between 2007 and 2011, and in 2016 agreed to a \"compact\" deal, following that year's assembly elections.\n\nFollowing the 2021 Senedd election, the Labour Welsh Government won 30 of 60 seats, one below an absolute majority, forming a Minority government. Plaid Cymru won thirteen seats. Following the election Welsh Labour announced it planned to govern without any formal assistance with members from other parties. But Welsh academic, Laura McAllister, argued a deal with another party was needed if Welsh Labour wanted to pass big or radical legislation through the Senedd.\n\nAgreement\n\nInitial talks \nTalks were conducted over summer 2021, with the two parties publicly reporting they were in talks in September 2021. Reports of the two close to reaching a final agreement were raised on 19 November 2021, although details were not provided as it still required ratification by both parties.\n\nWhen reports of talks were raised in September 2021, BBC News stated the two parties are likely to agree on Senedd reform, social care, council tax reform, free school meals and tackling second homes, but disagree on Welsh independence.\n\nThe Welsh Liberal Democrats, who have one MS, just enough to achieve a working majority with Welsh Labour, was not involved in any talks with the Welsh Government, despite a previous coalition between the Liberal Democrats and Welsh Labour. The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds MS, said not being in talks was \"right\". UK Liberal Democrats leader Ed Davey, supported the Welsh branch not being in talks, allowing Dodds, the party's sole Welsh MS, to be an independent opposition voice, and said a deal was never proposed to the party by the Welsh Government.\n\nThe executive committees of Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru approved a deal for the two to cooperate in the Senedd on 21 November 2021. Also further support from Plaid Cymru's party membership was still required at the time.\n\nAnnouncement and ratification \nThe agreement was formally announced on 22 November 2021, by both leaders in front of the Senedd building. Welsh Labour leader and first minister Mark Drakeford stated the agreement would bring a \"stable Senedd\" which can deliver \"radical change and reform\". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, called it \"historic\" for Wales, and allowed the party to both push its main priorities and criticise Labour on issues not in the agreement. At Plaid Cymru's conference on 26 November, Price described the agreement as \"a new kind of politics\" and a \"down-payment [...] on independence\", that allowed the party to become a \"co-opposition party\" rather than just a traditional opposition party. The agreement involved only Welsh Labour government ministers and not the party's backbench members, according to those backbench members.\n\nThe Plaid Cymru membership ratified the agreement during their annual conference on 27 November 2021 after 94% of the party's members supported the agreement, and on 1 December 2021, the agreement came into force after the two parties officially signed the agreement.\n\nPlaid Cymru can appoint special advisers to work within offices of the Welsh Government, but as it is not a coalition, no members of Plaid Cymru's Senedd Group can join the Welsh Government as ministers or deputies. Plaid Cymru would appoint a designated lead member for the agreement. While committees formed of Welsh Government ministers and designated members of Plaid Cymru would be formed to agree on issues covered in the agreement. Funding for the agreement were made part of the Welsh Government's budget. The Welsh Government stated Plaid Cymru can contribute to Welsh Government press releases, and there would be regular joint media briefings with leaders of the two parties.\n\nThe agreement was described by the leader of the Scottish National Party, Nicola Sturgeon, as grown up politics. While the Welsh Liberal Democrats commended it. The Conservatives condemned the deal. UK Labour, and its leader Keir Starmer, did not comment on the deal reached by its Welsh branch. Some senior Labour MP's in Wales did not comment on the agreement, a week after it was announced, with only four Labour MP's in Wales commenting with different amounts of praise.\n\nBy June 2023, the agreement's designated members from Plaid Cymru were Siân Gwenllian and Cefin Campbell.\n\nThe agreement lasts three years and involved the two parties working together in \"46 policy areas\".\n\nAgreed policies \nThe 46 policy areas, under four rough categories, in which the two parties aim to implement for Wales are as follows:\n\nSocial and Health \n\n Free school meals to all pupils in primary schools during the agreement.\n Free childcare for children up to two-years-old, with a focus on Welsh-medium education.\n Look into creating a \"National Care Service\", by creating an \"expert group\" to look into the proposal.\n Tackle the second homes crisis and unaffordable housing, using the property, land planning, and taxation systems.

Concerns over the lack of healthcare measures were also raised by the Liberal Democrats. On 1 December, UK Conservative Secretary of State for Wales, Simon Hart, called it an \"absolute travesty\", that allows Plaid Cymru to \"claim credit\" for government policies while also acting as an opposition party.\n\nThe Welsh Conservatives described the deal in December 2021 as undermining the work of the Welsh parliament. The Conservatives questioned Plaid Cymru's opposition status, and that for the government to be properly scrutinised, changes are to be made. If Plaid Cymru is considered as \"effectively in government\" rather than an opposition, one of the parliament's two presiding officers, Elin Jones of Plaid Cymru has to be from an opposition party instead. However, the rules specify a party's \"executive role\" defined as having government ministers which Plaid Cymru do not have as part of the agreement.\n\nIn December 2021, Labour MS Alun Davies, stated that while the deal \"might not be a coalition, [...] it looks like one\", and that Plaid Cymru is \"clearly part\" of the Welsh Government. This was rejected by Welsh business minister Lesley Griffiths who stated \"this is not a coalition\", as well as Plaid Cymru. Davies stated that backbench members of Welsh Labour had not been party to the agreement, which involved only Welsh Labour ministers. Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, did say he would prefer a coalition agreement. Hefin David, Labour MS, called on the presiding officer to make appointees of Plaid Cymru to also be called to answer questions in the Senedd, while also supporting the deal.\n\nIn July 2022, the Welsh Conservatives claimed that Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price failed to challenge the Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford because of the deal. Plaid Cymru stated, they do oppose the government \"strongly\" on issues outside the agreement.\n\nIn February 2023, Hefin David, Labour MS, criticised the agreement, saying it gave Plaid Cymru \"power without responsibility\". During the debate on the Welsh Government's budget, Plaid Cymru abstained to allow the budget to pass, but criticised ministers for not raising income tax to increase NHS funding. David argued for a formal coalition government or a confidence and supply agreement over the current deal, which David described as \"worst of both worlds\".\n\nIn May 2023, Ken Skates, Labour MS and former Welsh Government economy minister, called for the agreement to end, following a report into inappropriate behaviour tolerated within Plaid Cymru. Skates states he wouldn't like to work \"with bullies, misogynists or anyone who discriminates against others\". Following the report, Mark Drakeford, Welsh Labour leader, suggested the agreement is under review following the developments within Plaid Cymru.\n\nReferences \n\n2021 establishments in Wales\nWelsh Government\nPlaid Cymru\nWelsh Labour\n2021 in British politics", "unikey": "2021 Welsh Labour–Plaid Cymru agreement", "summary": "First Minister of Wales Incumbent\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Agreement", "Agreed_policies", "Criticism", "References"], "contents": ["Since the establishment of the Senedd, its usual largest party, the Welsh Labour party, has not gained an outright majority in the devolved parliament.

support our nation today  please donate here skip to content support us advertise contact home news opinion culture sport shop opinion keir starmers silence on the welsh labourplaid cymru deal is deafening 24 nov 2021 5 minute read differences in emphasis of policy issues there are notable difference between welsh and westminster labour when it comes to wales for example welsh labour is quite happy to accommodate independent views in the party mark drakeford was quite relaxed about allowing three labour senedd candidates supporting welsh independence westminster labour on the other hand constantly berates independence indeed the only time that stephen kinnock and chris bryant labour mps that have seats in wales seem to have anything to say about wales is to vilify welsh independence furthermore starmer has shown no interest in welsh politics causing irritation with some in welsh labour in his party leaders conference speech he only mentioned wales once moreover according to alun davies welsh labour am for blaenau gwent starmer has failed to meet the senedd labour group in wales since becoming leader and couldnt even be bothered to conduct a zoom meeting with the group mr davies said he found it extraordinary that westminster labour was not interested in hearing the views of a party who can hold on to marginal seats in wales that westminster labour cannot  for example wrexham starmer has also said that he would not work with the snp as mr davies said such an attitude could keep the tories in power indefinitely given starmers disdain towards talking to nationalist parties it seems reasonable to assume that the reason for starmers silence is partly because he disagrees with any deal with plaid cymru starmer has also shown himself to be wedded to the first past the post fptp system by rejecting it even though 80 of delegates at the labour party conference in october 2021 backed a motion to introduce fptp however drakeford is keen on electoral reform westminster labour may also be ambivalent of the deal because of a trend towards reducing welsh westminster mps and increasing powers and numbers of senedd mss the deal does contain a commitment to increase the number of mss above the current level of 60 to around 90 there are also differences on brexit the starmer strategy is not to talk about it or even discourage his party from doing so according to the guardian labour mps are being asked by the partys high command not to focus on problems caused by brexit when asking questions in parliament this is in marked contrast to drakeford and his mss who have constantly talked about the adverse effects of brexit such as through trade deals with australia which will hit the welsh economy finally there are notable differences on the climate crisis starmer to his credit has committed labour to more investment in green energy but he says little about how it will be paid for or how it to reconcile the move away from fossil fuels he did not even attend the cop26 summit by contrast drakeford and other members of welsh labour were in the thick of cop26 attending the conference and active in promulgating policy detail at the welsh level for example lee waters deputy minister for climate change has been remarkably candid and brave in stating that unpopular decisions such as the scrapping of a coal mining licence for aberpergwm colliery near glynneath will have to be cancelled to ensure carbon reduction targets final thought mark drakeford said we dont have a monopoly of good ideas when announcing the deal with plaid cymru

the leadership tried to block motions they didnt like they suspended many delegates therefore stopping them speaking at conference some suspensions were 24hrs before conference and no suspensions had to give a reason many members remain suspended with no recourse to justice so they tried to weight the deck in their favour and still the motions passed were bold  transformative leadership then said
