{"id": 70550690, "key": "Joshua 5", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua%205", "text": "Joshua 5 is the fifth chapter of the Book of Joshua in the Hebrew Bible or in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. According to Jewish tradition, the book was attributed to the Joshua, with additions by the high priests Eleazar and Phinehas, but modern scholars view it as part of the Deuteronomistic History, which spans the books of Deuteronomy to 2 Kings, attributed to nationalistic and devotedly Yahwistic writers during the time of the reformer Judean king Josiah in 7th century BCE. This chapter focuses on the circumcision and Passover of the Israelites after crossing  the Jordan River under the leadership of Joshua, a part of a section comprising Joshua 1:1–5:12 about the entry to the land of Canaan, and the meeting of Joshua with the Commander of the Lord's army near\n\nText\nThis chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language. It is divided into 15 verses.\n\nTextual witnesses\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls including 4Q47 (4QJosh; 200–100 BCE) with extant verses 1?, 2–7.\n\nExtant ancient manuscripts of a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (originally was made in the last few centuries BCE) include Codex Vaticanus (B; B; 4th century) and Codex Alexandrinus (A; A; 5th century). Fragments of the Septuagint Greek text containing this chapter is found in manuscripts such as Washington Manuscript I (5th century CE), and a reduced version of the Septuagint text is found in the illustrated Joshua Roll.\n\nAnalysis\nThe narrative of Israelites entering the land of Canaan comprises verses 1:1 to 5:12 of the Book of Joshua and has the following outline:\n\nA. Preparations for Entering the Land (1:1–18)\nB. Rahab and the Spies in Jericho (2:1–24)\nC. Crossing the Jordan (3:1–4:24)\nD. Circumcision and Passover (5:1–12)\n1. Canaanite Fear (5:1)\n2. Circumcision (5:2–9)\n3. Passover (5:10–12)\n\nThe second section of the book contains the narratives of Israelites conquering the land of Canaan comprising verses 5:13 to 12:24 and has the following outline:\n\nA. Jericho (5:13–6:27)\n1. Joshua and the Commander of the Lord's Army (5:13–15)\n2. Instructions for Capturing the City (6:1–5)\n3. Obeying the Instructions (6:6–21)\n4. The Deliverance of Rahab's Family and the City's Destruction (6:22–25)\n5. Curse and Renown (6:26–27)\nB. Achan and Ai (7:1–8:29)\nC. Renewal at Mount Ebal (8:30–35)\nD. The Gibeonite Deception (9:1–27)\nE. The Campaign in the South (10:1–43)\nF. The Campaign in the North and Summary List of Kings (11:1–12:24)\n\nCircumcision of the new generation (5:1–9)\nThe main subject of chapter 5 is \"beginning in new land\", as the people of Israel finally entered the promised land \"flowing with milk and honey\" (verse 6), the male population having circumcision, then the timely and correct celebration of the Passover (cf. Exodus 12:43–49), followed by the cessation of Manna (cf. Exodus 16:35). Circumcision was widespread among ancient Semites, but for the people of Israel, it marked the covenantal relationship with God, traced back to Abraham, with a statement that 'no uncircumcised male can be regarded as an Israelite' (Genesis 17:9–14). it is also a condition to be ritually pure to celebrate Passover in the new land, in contrast to God's decree banning the previously circumcised generation from Egypt to step in the land of Canaan (verses 4, 6; cf. Numbers 14:22–23; Deuteronomy 1:34–40). The term 'a second time' shows, that Joshua did not initiate the practice in Israel. With the circumcision, the \"disgrace of Egypt\" has been 'rolled away' (the verb in Hebrew resembling the name \"Gilgal\").\n\nVerse 1\nAnd it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the Lord had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.\nThe mention of 'Amorites' and 'Canaanites' for the inhabitants of the land of Canaan follows Deuteronomy 1–3, in which the Amorites are understood as the inhabitants of mountainous parts (Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 20; Joshua 10:6), whereas the Canaanites are more to the west, toward the Mediterranean Sea, so geographically viewed from the position of the Israelites at this time, the Amorites are mentioned before the Canaanties. Earlier it was recorded how the Israelites' hearts 'melted' because of the Amorites and the sons of Anakim (Deuteronomy 1:27–28), and then rashly took on the enemy unprepared (Deuteronomy 1:41–45), now it is the Amorites and the Canaanites who tremble before the approach of Israel and YHWH. \n\nVerse 5:1 shares the same language pattern as verses 9:1; 10:1 and 11:1, each of which introduces a new part of narrative.\n\nIn the Hebrew Masoretic Text, this verse is marked as an 'unconnected unit', bracketed with a parashah setumah (\"closed portion marking\") before and after.\n\nFirst Passover in the land of Canaan (5:10–12)\nThe first Passover in the land of Canaan was held in Gilgal at the correct date as commanded in the Book of Exodus, although here the rituals are not recorded in detail (cf. the Feast of Unleavened Bread that followed Passover for seven days, Leviticus 23:5–6). Rather, this Passover is associated with the ceasing of the Manna (cf. Exodus 16) and the eating of the produce of land. The 'unleavened cakes' recalls the 'unleavened bread' which had been the food of hasty flight from Egypt (Exodus 12:15-20; Deuteronomy 16:3), and eating along with 'parched grain' is consistent with a people not yet settled, but already begun to enjoy the legitimate possession of the land (Deuteronomy 6:10-11).\n\nVerse 10\nAnd the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.\n\"The fourteenth day of the month\":  The Passover in the land of Canaan on this exact date on the 41st years of the Israelites' wandering completes the bridge with the Exodus which started with the Passover in Egypt.\n\nCommander of the Lord's Army (5:13–15)\n\nThe narrative of Joshua's encounter with the 'commander of the army of the LORD' close to Jericho marks the beginning of the war of conquest. Joshua saw and presumed that this man is not an Israelite (hence the question \"Are you for us or for our enemies?\"). This commander indeed appears to be an 'angel (or messenger) of the LORD', who represents the presence of YHWH himself (cf. Judges 6:14; 13:20–22), sometimes in military function (Numbers 22:23; 2 Samuel 24:16–17; 2 Kings 19:35) or at other times in commissioning, as with Gideon (Judges 6:11–12); both are present here (cf. Moses' encounter with the angel of YHWH in the \"burning bush\"; Exodus 3:2, 4–6). Joshua evidently realized the angel's military role (verse 13) and the representation of God when he bowed down to worship this figure, experiencing a direct commissioning from God, like that of Moses, at the beginning of the real test of his leadership.\n\nVerse 14\nAnd he said, “No; but I am the commander of the army of the Lord. Now I have come.”\nAnd Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped and said to him, “What does my lord say to his servant?”\n\"Worshipped\": or \"paid homage\"\nThe terse response \"No\" from the commander makes clear that Israel needs to join God's battle instead of God joins them, and indicates that it is possible for Israel in some way not to join God in the battles.\n\nSee also\n\nRelated Bible parts: Exodus 12, Exodus 16, Deuteronomy 1, Joshua 3, Joshua 4.

swete and a few other scholars use the letter s a greek manuscript of the old and new testaments of the greatest antiquity and value found on mount sinai in st catherines monastery by constantine tischendorf he was visiting there in 1844 under the patronage of frederick augustus king of saxony when he discovered in a rubbish basket fortythree leaves of the septuagint containing portions of i par chron jer neh and esther he was permitted to take them he also saw the books of isaias and i and iv machabees belonging to the same codex as the fragments but could not obtain possession of them warning the monks of their value he left for europe and two years later published the leaves he had brought with him under the name of codex fridericoaugustanus after his patron they are preserved at leipzig on a second visit in 1853 he found only two short fragments of genesis which he printed on his return and could learn nothing of the rest of the codex in 1859 he made a third visit this time under the patronage of the czar alexander ii this visit seemed likewise fruitless when on the eve of his departure in a chance conversation with the steward he learned of the existence of a manuscript there when it was shown to him he saw the very manuscript he had sought containing beyond all his dreams a great part of the old testament and the entire new testament besides the epistle of barnabas and part of the shepherd of hermas of which two works no copies in the original greek were known to exist thinking it a crime to sleep tischendorf spent the night copying barnabas he had to leave in the morning after failing to persuade the monks to let him have the manuscript at cairo he stopped at a monastery belonging to the same monks they were of the orthodox greek church and succeeded i having the manuscript sent to him there for transcription and finally in obtaining it from the monks as a present to the czar tischendorfs patron and the protector of their church years later in 1869 the czar rewarded the two monasteries with gifts of money 7000 and 2000 roubles each and decorations the manuscript is treasured in the imperial library at st petersburg tischendorf published an account of it in 1860 and under the auspices of the czar printed it in facsimile in 1862 twentyone lithographic plates made from photographs were included in this edition which was issued in four volumes the following year he published a critical edition of the new testament finally in 1867 he published additional fragments of genesis and numbers which had been used to bind other volumes at st catherines and had been discovered by the archimandrite porfirius on four different occasions then portions of the original manuscript have been discovered they have never been published together in a single edition the codex sinaiticus which originally must have contained the whole old testament has suffered severely from mutilation especially in the historical books from genesis to esdras inclusive the rest of the old testament fared much better the fragments and books extant are several verses from gen xxiii and xxiv and from num v vi vii i par ix 27xix 17 esdras ix9 to end nehemias esther tobias judith joel abdias jonas nahum habacuc sophonias aggeus zacharias malachias isaias jeremias lamentations i 1ii 20 i machabees iv machabees apocryphal while the canonical ii machabees and the apocryphal iii machabees were never contained in this codex a curious occurrence is that esdras ix 9 follows i par xix 17 without any break the note of a corrector shows that seven leaves of i par were copied into the book of esdras probably by a mistake in the binding of the manuscript from which codex sinaiticus was copied our esdras is called in this codex as in many others esdras b this may indicate that it followed esdras a as the book called by jerome iii esdras see esdras is named in ancient codices the proof is by no means sure however as iv machabees is here designated machabees d as was usual although the second and third books of machabees were absent from the manuscript the new testament is complete likewise the epistle of barnabas six leaves following barnabas are lost which probably also contained uncanonical literature the shepherd of hermas is incomplete and we cannot tell whether other works followed in all there are 346 12 leaves the order of the new testament is to be noted st pauls epistles preceding acts hebrews following ii thess the manuscript is on good parchment the pages measure about 15 inches by 13 12 inches there are four columns to a page except in the poetical books which are written stichometrically in two columns of greater width there are 48 lines to a column but 47 in the catholic epistles the four narrow columns give the page the appearance of an ancient roll it is not impossible as kenyon says that it was in fact copied from a papyrus roll it is written in uncial characters well formed without accents or breathings and with no punctuation except at times the apostrophe and the single point for a period tischendorf judged that there were four hands engaged in the writing of the manuscript in this he has been generally followed he has been less happy in obtaining acceptance of his conjecture that one of these scribes also wrote the new testament of the vatican codex he recognized seven correctors of the text one of them contemporaneous with the writing of the manuscript the ammonian sections and the eusebian canons are indicated in the margin probably by a contemporary hand they seem to have been unknown to the scribe however who followed another division the clerical errors are relatively not numerous in gregorys judgment in age this manuscript ranks alongside the codex vaticanus its antiquity is shown by the writing by the four columns to a page an indication probably of the transition from the roll to the codex form of manuscript by the absence of the large initial letters and of ornaments by the rarity of punctuation by the short titles of the books the presence of divisions of the text antedating eusebius the addition of barnabas and hermas etc such indications have induced experts to place it in the fourth century along with codex vaticanus and some time before codex alexandrinus and codex ephræmi rescriptus this conclusion is not seriously questioned though the possibility of an early fifthcentury date is conceded its origin has been assigned to rome southern italy egypt and caesarea but cannot be determined kenyon handbook to the textual criticism of the new testament london 1901 p 56 sqq it seems to have been at one time at caesarea one of the correctors probably of seventh century adds this note at the end of esdras this codex was compared with a very ancient exemplar which had been corrected by the hand of the holy martyr pamphilus  which exemplar contained at the end of the subscription in his own hand taken and corrected according to the hexapla of origen antonius compared it i pamphilus corrected it pamphilus was with eusebius the founder of the library at caesarea some are even inclined to regard codex sinaiticus as one of the fifty manuscripts which constantine bade eusebius of caesarea to have prepared in 331 for the churches of constantinople but there is no sign of its having been at constantinople nothing is known of its later history till its discovery by tischendorf the text of codex sinaiticus bears a very close resemblance to that of codex vaticanus though it cannot be descended from the same immediate ancestor in general codex vaticanus is placed first in point of purity by contemporary scholars and codex sinaiticus next this is especially true for the new testament of the gospels the differences are more frequent in the old testament where the codices sinaiticus and alexandrinus often agree john f fenlon retrieved from httpsenwikisourceorgwindexphptitlecatholic_encyclopedia_1913codex_sinaiticusoldid4652053 category
