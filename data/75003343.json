It was founded in 1927 out of a predecessor organization whose roots went back to 1924. Its headquarters were in Paris, but in 1932 the French organization was disbanded. Under the name Liga zur Verteidigung der Negerrasse, there was a German section in Berlin from 1929 to 1935.\n\nHistory of origins\n\nLigue universelle de défense de la race noire \nThe Ligue universelle de défense de la race noire was founded on April 30, 1924, by Kojo Tovalou Houénou who also acted as chairman. It was the first major rallying organization of specifically Caribbean- as well as African-descended black people in France.  It published the bimonthly journal Les Continents from May 1924, headed by René Maran. Tovalou negotiated (unsuccessfully) with activists such as W. E. B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey during a trip to the United States in August 1924 to make Paris the headquarters of an international Pan-African organization. Upon his return to Paris, these contacts were deemed dangerous by French authorities and Tovalou was forced to leave the country. The simultaneous publication in the magazine of a sharp text by Maran against the first African member of the French parliament, Blaise Diagne, led to a libel suit. Weakened by the absence of its chairman, the Ligue disbanded.\n\nComité de défense de la race nègre \nFrom the ranks of the dissolved Ligue, Lamine Senghor and Joseph Gothon-Lunion founded a new organization, the Comité de Défense de la Race Nègre (CDRN), in March 1926. It edited the magazine La Voix des Negres. Particularly through the efforts of Senghor, who traveled through French port cities and gave speeches to workers, offshoots of the Comité de Défense were founded there as in West Africa. In 1926, the Comité had about 1000 members, 250 in Marseille, 150 in Bordeaux, 300 in Le Havre and 200 in Paris.\n\nHowever, content-related disputes quickly developed in the leadership of the Comité. On the one hand, there was the question of whether the term nègre or the term noir should serve as a self-designator - the retention of the term nègre was important to Senghor; he wanted to reappropriate the term and \"pull this word out of the mud through which they drag it to make it a symbol.\" According to him, the term nègre symbolized African origins and political radicalism, whereas noir was associated with colonialist political ideas.\n\nAt the center, however, was the question of the group's political radicalism. The assimilationist part of the committee was concerned with the decidedly anti-colonial as well as more working-class and consequently communist orientation of the Left Fraction and its willingness to openly criticize the French government, which could be interpreted as anti-French. These disputes led to a split in the CDRN at a general meeting on February 27, 1927. The moderate faction under Afro-Caribbean leadership took over the Comité and renamed it the Comité de défense de la race noire.\n\nLigue de Défense de la Race Nègre \nAs a result of the split, Senghor, Tiemoko Garan Kouyaté, and Camille Sainte-Rose founded the Ligue de Défense de la Race Nègre in May 1927, initially led by Senghor. From June, the monthly magazine La Race Nègre appeared as the publication of the group.\n\nNow without restrictions from the moderate and assimilationist members, the League formulated anti-colonialist positions such as the demand for independence of the colonies and linked them with communist ideas. It had active groups in all major port cities, with a total of about 1,000 members. Like its predecessor and successor organizations, the LDRN was monitored by the authorities. Of the 50 or so members spied on in Paris, about half worked as service providers or laborers, 7 were students and 5 were lawyers, and the rest were mostly small employees.\n\nWhile there was agreement on the basic anti-colonial principle, the exact demands within the group were quite variable. While some members articulated nationalist positions, others espoused pan-Africanist ideas. Although independence of any kind for the colonies was an undisputed common goal, the group also fought for improvements in the everyday status quo of French Africans. The communist ideas cultivated by the leadership repeatedly met with misgivings in parts of the group because this would keep out anti-imperialist-minded but noncommunist possible members of the group. Ludovic Lacombe, a Haitian member of the group, put it this way, saying that he was a \"nationalist but anti-Communist Negro who did not want a master, white or red.\"\n\nSenghor died as late as 1927. He was succeeded by Tiemoko Garan Kouyaté, who in the following years built up an international network, including with a Congolese group in Brussels, a short-lived group around Jomo Kenyatta in London, with American activists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, and in French colonies such as Senegal and Cameroon. To Cameroon, Kouyaté also smuggled in propaganda material, which greatly alarmed French authorities. For a short time, there was also a direct offshoot of the league in Kribi. In 1931, a dispute over the leadership of the group began between the communist wing around Kouyaté and a \"merely\" anti-imperialist wing around Émile Faure. Then, in April 1931, two different issues of La Race Nègre appeared, one by Émile Faure, André Béton, and Ludovic Lacombe, the other by Kouyaté. In August, Kouyaté changed the title of his journal to Le Cri des Nègres and in 1932 founded the Union des travailleurs nègres as an undogmatic communist successor to the Ligue, but it was soon taken over by dogmatic communists and expelled Kouyaté. In 1939, the UTN dissolved itself.\n\nThe German chapter - Liga zur Verteidigung der Negerrasse \nIn Berlin on September 17, 1929, seven men from Douala, Cameroon founded the Liga zur Verteidigung der Negerrasse (LzVN). With this step, they opposed worsening economic difficulties and racial prejudice in Germany and wanted to establish an organisation for political work and some mutual moral and financial support.Over the course of the year, about 30 black men and women came together, some of whom had already met in the Afrikanischer Hilfsverein, the first organisation of Black Germans, centered on mutual support, which had disbanded in the mid-1920s. The founding of the German section of the LDRN was supported by Willi Münzenberg, founder of the League Against Imperialism, who had already been bringing together important people from the African community in Berlin for anti-colonialist motives since 1926. He also established contact with Tiemoko Garan Kouyaté, who was present at the founding meeting. A few months earlier, Kouyaté had already had copies of La Race Nègre distributed in Berlin via Münzenberg.\n\nMost members came from the former German colony of Cameroon, some from West Africa, such as Togo. All black Germans and their relatives could become members of the association. The president was Victor Bell, other board members were Thomasul Kuo Ngambi, Louis Brody, Richard Ekamby Menzel and, as secretary general and central figure, the Pan-Africanist and communist Joseph Bilé, who was increasingly active in international politics with the help of his mentors George Padmore and Kouyaté.\n\nIn its statutes, it declared as the purpose of the association to achieve the \"liberation of the Negroes\" internationally and to fight nationally for a large, independent African state. It advocated the independence of African states, especially the defense of the independence of Liberia and Ethiopia, encouraged black Germans to join German unions, and urged its members to provide mutual moral and material support, a legacy from the Afrikanischer Hilfsverein.\n\nThe LzVN was organizationally part of the League Against Imperialism, was financed by it and also had its headquarters in its rooms at Friedrichstraße 24. It cooperated with the Communist International and a larger network of black internationalist organizations and activists in Europe and Africa, in addition to its French sister organization. The group smuggled political writings such as the statutes of the LzVN, among others, to Cameroon and maintained contact with activists there; most likely, they were also involved in anti-colonial protests in Duala. In 1930, the group performed Brody's play Sunrise in the Orient in Neukölln, the first half in Duala, the second in French, English and German. The play presented African history and culture of Africans probably for the first time in Germany without resorting to contemporary stereotypes. However, plans to establish its own \"race theater\" were not realized because the financial resources expected by the Ligueof Kouyaté were not available. Also in 1930, Bilé attended the First International Conference of Negro Workers in Hamburg as a delegate of the LzVN, which enhanced his status within the anti-colonial movement, as did subsequent discussions about him in the League Against Imperialism and the Comintern, which earmarked him for training in Moscow and deployment as an agitator in Africa.\n\nAs the debate over Bilé continued, there were also accusations by the LzVN against the League Against Imperialism that it was not providing the group with sufficient financial support. According to Bilé, the responsible supervisors, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and Bohumír Šmeral, had failed to honor several funding pledges; according to Kouyaté, Chattopadhyaya had even opposed any further funding for the group, seeing it as no loss if it disbanded. As a result, the LzVN refused to continue working with the LgI and instead turned to the KPD for support. Although this pacified the conflict, the personal hardship of the members led to internal squabbles and intrigue. With the Nazi seizure of power, the group became defenseless. The KPD and the League Against Imperialism had been dissolved, Padmore and Münzenberg had left the country, and Kouyaté had been expelled from the French Ligue. As a result, the LzVN ceased its work completely. Many members of the LzVN left Germany; by August 1934, according to Bell, the group had only two members left. In 1935 the group was officially disbanded.\n\nReferences \n\nAnti-imperialism\nComintern\nHistory of colonialism\nHistory of France\nHistory of Germany\nPan-Africanist organizations in Europe\nAnti-imperialism in Europe", "unikey": "Ligue de défense de la race nègre", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["History_of_origins", "Ligue_de_Défense_de_la_Race_Nègre", "The_German_chapter:_Liga_zur_Verteidigung_der_Negerrasse", "References"], "contents": ["### Ligue universelle de défense de la race noire\nTheLigue universelle de défense de la race noire[Wikidata]was founded on April 30, 1924, byBeninesePan-AfricanistKojo Tovalou Houénouwho also acted as chairman.

Led by Émile Faure as president, it took a resolutely pan-African and anti-colonialist position, attacking assimilationists as well as communist anti-colonialists and theNégritudemovement.La Race Nègrewas published sporadically until it ceased in 1936, representing \"the core of a full-blown doctrine of nationalism, cultural and political, the first breakthrough of this kind among French Negroes\".The LDRN was finally suppressed in 1937 by French authorities, and Faure was arrested and banished to theSaharauntil the end ofWorld War II.\n", "In Berlin on September 17, 1929, seven men fromDouala, Cameroon founded theLiga zur Verteidigung der Negerrasse(LzVN).

author robbie aitken joseph bilé the negro worker july 1932 vol2 no7 p28 on the 8th of december 1929 at alexanderplatz in berlin the sozialistischer schülerbund union of socialist school pupils staged an antinationalist and anticolonial demonstration this was part of the increasing anticolonial events being organized and run by the political left within germany under the direction of the communist international comintern the second speaker of the afternoon was joseph ekwe bilé bilé from douala cameroon was enthusiastically greeted by his audience which reports suggested included a further five africans this essay focuses on the political career of joseph bilé in order to highlight aspects of the largely forgotten political activism of africans who were living in germany particularly berlin in the late 1920s it examines the creation of the lzvn as well as several concrete examples of members political activities including a remarkable theatre project staged by the group in 1930 these in turn highlight the presence of germanbased africans within wider transnational networks of anticolonialism and antiracism often in connection with the comintern and transnational networks of black internationalism blacks in interwar berlin bilé was one of around 250500 black residents and their germanborn children living in berlin in the late 1920s the vast majority of whom could trace their roots back to germanys former african colonies most originally came from cameroon while a handful of others came from togo or the former german east africa presentday tanzania burundi and rwanda like the overwhelming majority bilé arrived in germany pre1914 he was the son of the influential trader james bilé a mbule and his wife georgette eyango and like an older brother robert ebolo and sister esther sike was sent by his parents to be educated in germany indeed dozens of children from elite cameroonian and togolese coastal families went to school or served an apprenticeship in imperial germany in bilés case he attended the technical school in hildburghausen in thuringia from 1912 to 1914 qualifying as a civil engineer while his siblings returned to douala before the outbreak of world war one bilé like several hundred african contemporaries became effectively stateless and stranded in europe as a result of the fighting and the subsequent peace process the latter saw germany stripped of its overseas empire and its colonies placed under mandate protection in general the new mandate authorities primarily the french and the british were unwilling to allow africans from the now former german colonies to return home now stuck in europe after serving briefly in the german army during the war bilé like many african contemporaries struggled to find longterm stable employment he moved around from east prussia to berlin to vienna and back to berlin over the course of the 1920s and it is against this context of increased economic crisis by late 1920s and rising racial prejudice that the lzvn was created its creation can be seen as part of a longer history of anticolonial protest amongst africans living in germany that developed out of personal experiences of actual colonialism as well as their experiences of living in germany and being subjected to exclusionary and discriminatory practices examples included the early pre1914 activism of the duala men alfred bell and mpundu akwa the formation of the selfhelp organisation afrikanischer hilfsverein african welfare association in hamburg in 1918 of which bilé was a member and the petition sent to the national assembly at weimar in the immediate postwar period by a group of africans led by the cameroonian martin dibobe the latter initiative called for a renegotiation of the relationship between cameroon and germany which would free cameroon from the hold of colonialism and help bring about the countrys development the petitioners were to be disappointed but a number including bilé found a new outlet for their activism in the lzvn tiemoko garan kouyaté willi münzenberg and the league against imperialism from the beginning the lzvn was under the influence of both the comintern and wider related and developing networks of black internationalism it was formed in the presence of the french sudanese radical tiemoko garan kouyaté who was secretary of the similarly named organization the ligue de défense de la race nègre based in paris the league for the defence of the negro race what do we know about the lzvn membership was open to all black people partly reflecting the black internationalist ethos of the organization as well as the diversity of germanys black population in addition white wives were also allowed to join a report drawn up by bilé the groups secretary suggests that there were around thirty members including several women the majority were from cameroon but a handful came from togo and other parts of west africa most were based in berlin where the group had an office within the headquarters of münzenbergs league against imperialism at friedrichstrasse 24 this address served as meeting center for a wide range of german and foreign nationals bringing diverse activist groups into contact and enabling collaboration and exchange the groups constitution was a hybrid product of competing concerns we can see the influence of the socialist revolutionary vision of the comintern kouyatés black internationalist outlook as well as the more daytoday concerns of germanbased africans thus among other things it stressed the need for unity between white and black workers worldwide called for independence for african states the defence of liberian and ethiopian independence the liberation of african americans and it encouraged black germans to join german trade unions in addition members were to provide moral and material support to one another in times of illness and unemployment echoing elements of earlier black german selfhelp initiatives all too little is known about the groups political activities members were actively engaged in an exchange of information between germany and africa smuggling propaganda material including copies of the groups constitution in private letters being sent to friends and relatives on the west coast of africa indeed the french mandate authorities expressed concern in the early 1930s that anticolonial literature as well as copies of the communist newspaper die rote fahne were reaching douala and being distributed further inland perhaps the most intriguing example of activism however is the one we know least about berlin  vienna  baltimore in january 1930 the baltimore afroamerican newspaper drew readers attention to the creation of a race theatre in berlin announced by victor bell the lzvns presidentan announcement that hints at other transnational connections germanys black population had established according to multiple reports it was his colleague the actor bebe mpessa better known under his stage name of louis brody who was behind these plans the first half of the revue performed partly in an unspecified bantu language likely duala was set around 1880 and was to critically engage with the impact of european colonialism on africa from an african perspective the second half set in the present was performed in french english and german the show was composed of thirty black male performers eight black female performers three white performers and included a jazz orchestra hopes to recruit black performers from the united states and receive funding from kouyatés group in paris appear not to have been realised all the props and costumes were made by the black performers themselves while a berlin artist helped with the design of the sets although rehearsals started at the beginning of 1930 it was not until december that sunrise in the orient received its premiere at kliems ballroom in the hasenheide neukölln a venue with strong links to the workers movement just how often the revue was staged and how it was received by berlin audiences remains largely unknown although it did draw some unwanted attention the nazi mouthpiece the völkischer beobachter produced a scathing article expressing surprise at the very thought of a play centring on african culture being performed in berlin james ford george padmore joseph bilé it is difficult to believe that bilé would not have been involved in this project at the same time over the course of 1930 he was emerging as the lzvns most influential figure and was being drawn into wider anticolonial and black liberation circles in july he was the groups representative at the first international conference of negro workers and there is some evidence to suggest that he was involved in helping to organise the event over the course of the conference participants drew up political demands for equality for africans and the realisation of the right of selfdetermination or the creation of independent african states bilé and ten others then travelled to moscow to attend the fifth congress of the international trade union and to celebrate the creation of the itucnw once back in berlin bilé was debriefed about his moscow experience by officials of the league against imperialism and he participated in advisory discussions concerning future communist activities in africa as a further sign of his growing influence he was increasingly active as a political agitator in various large factory and street cells as an agitprop leader amongst other things bilés connection to padmore helped to establish him as a key speaker who featured at a number of related demonstrations often in berlin where he frequently spoke to audiences of up to one and a half thousand people the french mandate authorities were also subject to his criticism his critique however covered all forms of colonial control and echoed demands coming from cameroon itself that cameroon be granted its independence such political activities resulted in him being arrested twice bilé in moscow while bilé was increasingly involved in comintern agitation the lzvn increasingly fell victim to infighting this was partly on account of the strains placed upon members by their dire financial and social situation in germany which led to the development of intrigues and jealousies padmore suggested closing the group down and set about trying to rescue bilé from his situation in keeping with comintern efforts to expand its support base amongst african workers and in africa he argued that bilé be sent to moscow for training and future work in cameroon in summer 1932 bilé arrived in moscow to attend the communist university of the toilers of the east at the university and under the alias of charles morris bilé was part of section 9 an englishspeaking section devoted to africans during his eighteen month stay he attended classes with future kenyan president jomo kenyatta and he came into contact with a number of influential africans and africanamericans all of whom were similarly mobile within the transnational networks of african political activity he undertook a variety of courses in political and economic theory focusing on themes such as the soviet economy leninism and dialectical materialism as well as a course on party and trade union activism his progress was frequently reported on tutors were divided over whether he was a fiery nationalist or whether he avoided nationalist entanglements some complained that he was too bourgeois and even too german having spent too long in europe nonetheless they agreed that he was a model student and entirely dependable politically from paris to cameroon in february 1934 after completing his training bilé left moscow for paris he was provided with a letter of reference to join the french communist party but little else in paris he was penniless without papers and had no hope of returning to germany where he had left behind a daughter and all his possessions during his time in moscow the context of black internationalist and anticolonial politics in europe and cameroon had changed in germany following the nazisseizure of power the cominterns anticolonial movement had been wiped out münzenbergs league against imperialism had been shut down padmore had been forced to flee and the lzvn had effectively ceased functioning lzvn president victor bell appears to have been invited to discuss the groups future at the nazishorstwesselhaus in berlin at the beginning of 1933 officially the group was wound up in 1935 meanwhile bilés mentors kouyaté and padmore had both broken with the comintern as the latter shifted towards closer collaboration with the western powers in order to combat the threat of nazism for several years bilé had expressed a desire to return to cameroon primarily for family reasons but his political connections had made that impossible after renouncing communism however the french mandate authorities allowed him to return home in 1935 back in douala he largely withdrew from political life started a family and found work as an architect interview with guilaume dina ekwe bilé douala 17 march 2006
