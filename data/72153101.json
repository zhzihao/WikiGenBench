Algeria was a center of the Trans-Saharan slave trade route of enslaved Black Africans from sub-Saharan Africa, as well as a center of the slave trade of Barbary slave trade of Europeans captured by the barbary pirates. \n\nSlavery was formally prohibited in 1848, but the French colonial authorities in Algeria was slow to enforce emancipation because of fear that it would lead to unrest among the Algerians against the French, and slavery and slave trade was still ongoing in the early 20th-century.\n\nSlave trade\n\nAfrican slave trade \n\nSince antiquity, Algeria was a center of the Trans-Saharan slave trade of enslaved Africans from Sub Saharan Africa across the Sahara desert to the Mediterranean world. \n\nThe oasis Ouargla in Algerian Sahara, which was trategically situated between the Niger River and the Mediterranean Sea, was a major trade hub of ensalved Africans from what the Arabs referred to as the bilad al-Sudan (\"Land of the Blacks\") south of the Sahara across the desert to be sold to the Southern and Eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.  \nAfrican slaves trafficked across the Sahara desert, journey which most of them was forced to undertake on foot, was kept to rest at the oasis after a dangerous  journey many of them did not survive, before they continued to the Mediterranean slave market.   The slaves were taught rudimentary Arabic to be able to communicate with their future masters, and some slave traders also taught them Islam in preparation of conversion.   \n\nThe slave trade from sub-Saharan Africa continued openly until the mid 19th-century.\n\nOver 28 million subsaharans were enslaved in North Africa over the course of the trans-saharan slave trade.\n\nEuropean slave trade\n\nThere is historical evidence of North African Muslim slave raids all along the Mediterranean coasts across Christian Europe. The majority of slaves traded across the Mediterranean region were predominantly of European origin from the 7th to 15th centuries. In the 15th century, Ethiopians sold slaves from western borderland areas (usually just outside the realm of the Emperor of Ethiopia) or Ennarea.\n\nBetween the 16th-century until the early 19th-century, Morocco was a center of the Barbary slave trade of Europeans captured by barbary pirates in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBarbary corsairs and crews from the quasi-independent North African Ottoman provinces of Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and the independent Sultanate of Morocco under the Alaouite dynasty (the Barbary Coast) were the scourge of the Mediterranean. Capturing merchant ships and enslaving or ransoming their crews provided the rulers of these nations with wealth and naval power. The Trinitarian Order, or order of \"Mathurins\", had operated from France for centuries with the special mission of collecting and disbursing funds for the relief and ransom of prisoners of Mediterranean pirates. \n\nAccording to Robert Davis, between 1 and 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves between the 16th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe slave trade of Europeans ended after the Barbary wars in the early 19th-century. There was a continuing campaign by various European navies and the American navy to suppress the piracy against Europeans by the North African Barbary states. The specific aim of this expedition, however, was to free Christian slaves and to stop the practice of enslaving Europeans. To this end, it was partially successful, as the Dey of Algiers freed around 3,000 slaves following the Bombardment of Algiers (1816) and signed a treaty against the slavery of Europeans. However, this practice did not end completely until the French conquest of Algeria.\n\nThe Dey freed 1,083 Christian slaves and the British Consul and repaid the ransom money taken in 1816, about £80,000. Over 3,000 slaves in total were later freed. Drescher notes Algiers as 'the sole case in the sixty years of British slave trade suppression in which a large number of British lives were lost in actual combat.' However, despite British naval efforts, it has been difficult to assess the long-term impact of the Bombardment of Algiers, as the Dey reconstructed Algiers, replacing Christian slaves with Jewish labour, and the Barbary slave trade continued under subsequent Deys (see Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)). Algiers' involvement with the slave trade did not end conclusively until the French invasion of Algiers in 1830.\n\nFunction and conditions\n\nFemale slaves\n See also: Islamic views on concubinage and Ma malakat aymanuhum\n\nFemale slaves were primarily used as either domestic servants, or as concubines (sex slaves). \n\nSome women who fell victim to sexual slavery as concubines ended up in the harems of influential men, and as favorite concubines, they could sometimes achieve influence, which was noted in contemporary diplomatic reports. In a report from 1676, Mohammed Trik, the  Dey of Algers, is noted to have been married to a former slave concubine, described as a \"cunning covetous English woman, who would sell her soule for a Bribe\", with whom the English viewed it as \"chargeable to bee kept in her favour… for Countrysake\".\n\nMale slaves\nMale slaves were used as laborers, eunuchs or soldiers. The conditions of slavery could be very hard, and male slaves were made to work in hard labor in heavy construction, in quarries, and as galley slaves, rowing the galleys, including the galleys of the barbary corsair pirates themselves.\n\nAbolition\n\nAbolition of the Barbary slave trade\n\nThe slave trade of Europeans ended after the Barbary wars in the early 19th-century. \n\nOn 11 October 1784, Moroccan pirates seized the American brigantine Betsey. The Spanish government negotiated the freedom of the captured ship and crew; however, Spain advised the United States to offer tribute to prevent further attacks against merchant ships. The United States Minister to France, Thomas Jefferson, decided to send envoys to Morocco and Algeria to try to purchase treaties and the freedom of the captured sailors held by Algeria. \n\nThe Barbary pricay was eradicated after the Second Barbary war. \n\nWhen the French took control over Algeria and abolished slavery in 1848, only Black African slaves are mentioned.\n\nAbolition of African slave trade and slavery\n\nSlavery was abolished in Algeria after the French conquest of Algeria in 1830-1848. The abolition was a consequence of the fact that slavery was abolished in France and Algeria was a part of France, being a French colony, and therefore fell under French law. \n\nThe passage of the 18 July 1845 law that afforded greater rights to slaves was seen as a predecessor to the liberation of slaves. \nThe issue was also debated with colonial French officials in Algeria. In 1847 Marechal Bugeaud advised strongly against the abolition of slavery in Algeria and warned that the Algerians submitted to France only if their religion, custom and property was respected and that they could very likely revolt if slavery was abolished.\nThe Revolution of 1848, followed by the decree making Algeria a part of France and thereby lible to French law, made it clear that any French abolition would also become law in French Algeria, and on 27 April 1848 the French Parliament proclaimed legal abolition of slavery and slave trade and the emancipation of all slaves throughout the French empire and its colonies, including French Algeria.\n\nEnforcement \nThe enforcement of the abolition law differed between different parts of Algeria and the French officials locally responsible, as the colonial administrators used the local enforcement of the law as a way to punish or reward local elites in accordance with French interests. The result was that the actual abolition of slavery and slave trade in Algeria was highly localized and gradual.\n\nThe French officials in Algeria enforced emancipation slowly and gradually, and the instructions to local officials was to take great care in enforcing the law: \n\"Seeing that the emancipation of the Black slave race in Algeria represents a threat to Arab property, it should be undertaken only gradually, beginning with the coastal cities, and extend it to those of the interior, and from there to the Arab tribes.\" \nSeveral officials warned that to enforce the emancipation decree the French would have to reimburse the slave owners otherwise there might be a rebellion.\n\nOne decade after the formal emancipation, it was clear that the actual enforcement had been slow and that the slave trade still took place. The Marechal Governeur General wrote to a local French official on 12 November 1857: \"Slaves have been recently sold in certain markets of Algeria. I do not need to remind you that this commerce is against the law, but I must recommend that you take great care to ascertain that the letter of this law is respected. Black men and women brought in to Algeria to be sold must be immediately liberated without allowing the traders to claim any indemnity whatsoever\".\n\nAs late as 1906, French officials reported that slave trade was still openly ongoing in the oasis of the Algerian Sahara, where slave trade was seen as legal and legitimate and any enforcement of the emancipation decree of 1848 would result in a rebellion, causing the French to issue a new decree of July 1906 reiterating the illegality of slave trade in Algeria.\n\nAfter the emancipation decree, slaves started to apply for manummission from the French civil officials, apparently aware of the law; also slaves from Morrocco and Liby, where slavery was still legal, crossed to borders in to French Algeria to apply for liberation from the French.\nSlaves continued to apply for manumission from their Arab owners by the French authorities from the Emancipation Proclamation in 1848 until World War I.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n History of slavery in the Muslim world\n History of concubinage in the Muslim world\n Human trafficking in the Middle East\n\nReferences\n\n Roger Botte, Esclavages et abolitions en terres d'islam.

The sex slave-concubines of rich Urban men who had given birth to the son of their enslaver were counted as the most priviliged, since they became anUmm Waladand became free upon the death of their enslaver; the concubine of a Beduoin mainly lived the same life as the rest of the tribal members and the women of the family.Female domestic slaves lived a hard life and reproduction among slaves was low; it was noted that the infant mortality was high among slaves, and that female slaves were often raped in their childhood and rarely lived in their forties, and that poorer slave owners often prostituted them.\nSome women who fell victim to sexual slavery as concubines ended up in the harems of influential men, and as favorite concubines, they could sometimes achieve influence, which was noted in contemporary diplomatic reports.

grabmeierohio state news grabmeier1osuedu editors note 32120 for an update on this story visit why is a 16yearold book on slavery so popular now a new study suggests that a million or more european christians were enslaved by muslims in north africa between 1530 and 1780  a far greater number than had ever been estimated before in a new book robert davis professor of history at ohio state university developed a unique methodology to calculate the number of white christians who were enslaved along africas barbary coast arriving at much higher slave population estimates than any previous studies had found most other accounts of slavery along the barbary coast didnt try to estimate the number of slaves or only looked at the number of slaves in particular cities davis said most previously estimated slave counts have thus tended to be in the thousands or at most in the tens of thousands davis by contrast has calculated that between 1 million and 125 million european christians were captured and forced to work in north africa from the 16th to 18th centuries daviss new estimates appear in the book christian slaves muslim masters white slavery in the mediterranean the barbary coast and italy 15001800 palgrave macmillan much of what has been written gives the impression that there were not many slaves and minimizes the impact that slavery had on europe davis said most accounts only look at slavery in one place or only for a short period of time but when you take a broader longer view the massive scope of this slavery and its powerful impact become clear davis said it is useful to compare this mediterranean slavery to the atlantic slave trade that brought black africans to the americas over the course of four centuries the atlantic slave trade was much larger  about 10 to 12 million black africans were brought to the americas but from 1500 to 1650 when transatlantic slaving was still in its infancy more white christian slaves were probably taken to barbary than black african slaves to the americas according to davis one of the things that both the public and many scholars have tended to take as given is that slavery was always racial in nature  that only blacks have been slaves but that is not true davis said we cannot think of slavery as something that only white people did to black people during the time period davis studied it was religion and ethnicity as much as race that determined who became slaves enslavement was a very real possibility for anyone who traveled in the mediterranean or who lived along the shores in places like italy france spain and portugal and even as far north as england and iceland he said pirates called corsairs from cities along the barbary coast in north africa  cities such as tunis and algiers  would raid ships in the mediterranean and atlantic as well as seaside villages to capture men women and children the impact of these attacks were devastating  france england and spain each lost thousands of ships and long stretches of the spanish and italian coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants at its peak the destruction and depopulation of some areas probably exceeded what european slavers would later inflict on the african interior although hundreds of thousands of christian slaves were taken from mediterranean countries davis noted the effects of muslim slave raids was felt much further away it appears for example that through most of the 17th century the english lost at least 400 sailors a year to the slavers even americans were not immune for example one american slave reported that 130 other american seamen had been enslaved by the algerians in the mediterranean and atlantic just between 1785 and 1793 davis said the vast scope of slavery in north africa has been ignored and minimized in large part because it is on no ones agenda to discuss what happened the enslavement of europeans doesnt fit the general theme of european world conquest and colonialism that is central to scholarship on the early modern era he said many of the countries that were victims of slavery such as france and spain would later conquer and colonize the areas of north africa where their citizens were once held as slaves maybe because of this history western scholars have thought of the europeans primarily as evil colonialists and not as the victims they sometimes were davis said davis said another reason that mediterranean slavery has been ignored or minimized has been that there have not been good estimates of the total number of people enslaved people of the time  both europeans and the barbary coast slave owners  did not keep detailed trustworthy records of the number of slaves in contrast there are extensive records that document the number of africans brought to the americas as slaves so davis developed a new methodology to come up with reasonable estimates of the number of slaves along the barbary coast davis found the best records available indicating how many slaves were at a particular location at a single time he then estimated how many new slaves it would take to replace slaves as they died escaped or were ransomed the only way i could come up with hard numbers is to turn the whole problem upside down  figure out how many slaves they would have to capture to maintain a certain level he said it is not the best way to make population estimates but it is the only way with the limited records available putting together such sources of attrition as deaths escapes ransomings and conversions davis calculated that about onefourth of slaves had to be replaced each year to keep the slave population stable as it apparently was between 1580 and 1680 that meant about 8500 new slaves had to be captured each year overall this suggests nearly a million slaves would have been taken captive during this period using the same methodology davis has estimated as many as 475000 additional slaves were taken in the previous and following centuries the result is that between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly 1 million and quite possibly as many as 125 million white european christians enslaved by the muslims of the barbary coast davis said his research into the treatment of these slaves suggests that for most of them their lives were every bit as difficult as that of slaves in america as far as daily living conditions the mediterranean slaves certainly didnt have it better he said while african slaves did grueling labor on sugar and cotton plantations in the americas european christian slaves were often worked just as hard and as lethally  in quarries in heavy construction and above all rowing the corsair galleys themselves davis said his findings suggest that this invisible slavery of european christians deserves more attention from scholars we have lost the sense of how large enslavement could loom for those who lived around the mediterranean and the threat they were under he said slaves were still slaves whether they are black or white and whether they suffered in america or north africa share this page when europeans were slaves research suggests white slavery was much
