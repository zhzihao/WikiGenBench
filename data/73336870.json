{"id": 73336870, "key": "Mother of Mercy: The Call of the Horse", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%20of%20Mercy%3A%20The%20Call%20of%20the%20Horse", "text": "\"Mother of Mercy: The Call of the Horse\" is the series premiere of the American science fiction drama television series Mrs. Davis. The episode was written by series creators Tara Hernandez and Damon Lindelof, and directed by executive producer Owen Harris. It was released on Peacock on April 20, 2023, alongside the three follow-up episodes.\n\nThe series follows Simone, a nun holding a grudge against Mrs. Davis, a powerful artificial intelligence that was able to prevent wars and famine by giving everyone what they wanted. Due to her past, Simone despises Mrs. Davis, and is part of the reason why she joined the convent. Soon, Simone is thrown into a world of chaos as she decides to accept a quest.\n\nThe series premiere received positive reviews from critics, who praised the series' ambition, performances, writing and tone shifts.\n\nPlot\n\n1307\nIn Paris, a group of Knights Templar are publicly burned for heresy. The next day, soldiers raid a convent, claiming that the occupants are hiding the Holy Grail. The nuns reveal themselves to also be Templars and kill the soldiers, although all but one perish in the process. The last surviving Templar is told to escape with the Grail.\n\nPresent day\nAt an island, a sailor named Arthur Schrodinger (Ben Chaplin) has been shipwrecked with his cat for the past ten years. At night, he uses a rocket to send fireworks, hoping a boat will notice it. The next morning, he is saved by a boat. He is informed by a crew member that she is aware of his history, despite the fact that he was on board for just one hour. The woman explains that ever since he went missing, an artificial intelligence known as Mrs. Davis was deployed to stop famine and war, giving people what they want. She invites him to ask \"her\" anything through an earbud.\n\nIn Reno, Nevada, a married man is being driven by a woman for a one-night stand. When they almost hit a cow, the car crashes into a billboard, beheading the woman. Two police officers arrive at the scene, and the man tries to buy his way out of the incident. Suddenly, a nun named Simone (Betty Gilpin) arrives on a horse, and exposes the officers as magicians who tried to set him up, revealing that the cow is not real and the woman was safe in the trunk. As she leaves, the man is called by Mrs. Davis, who wants to talk to Simone. Simone refuses, and calls her as an \"it\".\n\nThe next day, Simone and the other nuns are informed by the Mother Superior (Margo Martindale) that she is selling the land and they will need to move. Simone deduces that this is result of her constantly ignoring Mrs. Davis. While stopping at a diner, Simone is subdued by a group of Germans, who want to know where \"it\" is, with Simone confused over what they want, or they will use a detonator to kill her horse. She escapes from them and is saved by Wiley (Jake McDorman), her ex-boyfriend. He takes her to the desert and lets her inside a hatch, with their conversation revealing that Simone used to be named Lizzie and that Wiley is part of a movement opposing Mrs. Davis. He dismisses her claims that the detonator kills her horse and activates it, until they discover that it actually killed the horse.\n\nAngry, Simone drives away in a motorbike. She meets with her husband Jay (Andy McQueen), who suggests that Mrs. Davis really wants to meet her. She arrives at her old kindergarten school, where she meets with a woman. The woman is representing Mrs. Davis, who finally gets to talk to her. Simone realizes that Mrs. Davis manipulated the nuns to leave the convent, which would allow Mrs. Davis to buy it. Mrs. Davis offers Simone a wish for anything she wants, if she joins a quest. A tearful Simone says that her wish is for Mrs. Davis to turn off. Mrs. Davis accepts to do so, explaining the Simone's quest involves finding and destroying the Holy Grail. Although confused, Simone accepts.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe project was announced in May 2021, when Peacock announced a series order for the series, with Damon Lindelof and Tara Hernandez serving as co-creators. The concept explored the idea of faith fighting technology, something that Lindelof considered an universal theme, \"I have said everything that I have to say that's even remotely interesting about the afterlife, but I do feel that this is the primary fixation of what it is to be a human being on the planet.\" He further added, \"Before we were talking about Mrs. Davis, we were feeling this real anxiety about technology. This idea of we need it, we love it, but we think we're using it too much. And we think we're using it for the wrong stuff. Is there a way to talk about this in a slightly goofier way? And to embody it in a story around a nun who is told to go find the Holy Grail and if she is successful she is able to defeat the A.I. She could be our avatar or superhero.\"\n\nThe episode was written by Tara Hernandez and Damon Lindelof, and directed by executive producer Owen Harris.\n\nCasting\n\nIn March 2022, Betty Gilpin was announced to star in the series, having previously worked with Lindelof in The Hunt. Originally, Gilpin was unavailable after giving birth to her child, but was approached once again after meeting with Lindelof and Hernandez. Her father, Jack Gilpin, is an Episcopal priest who introduced her to nuns in preparation for the role.\n\nIn May 2022, Jake McDorman was announced to star opposite Gilpin as part of the main cast. The following month, Andy McQueen, Ben Chaplin and Margo Martindale were announced to join the series.\n\nWriting\nThe writers intended to use as many significant tropes associated with the Holy Grail, with Hernandez explaining, \"one of the things that I think we all leaned into is this being a quest for the Holy Grail. Because [the show] centers on this algorithm which embraces, loves and repeat cliches, we looked at the Grail expectations.\" Both Hernandez and Lindelof settled on the idea that Simone wouldn't use faith as her coping mechanism, a concept that Lindelof explored in his previous series, \"I'm using my belief as a way of coping with the mystery. But [Simone] doesn't have that mystery in her life.\"\n\nCritical reception\n\"Mother of Mercy: The Call of the Horse\" received positive reviews from critics. Jenna Scherer of The A.V. Club gave the premiere an \"A-\" grade and wrote, \"Bizarre, shaggy, funny, and surprisingly profound, Mrs. Davis isn't a show so much to be described as experienced.\"\n\nAlan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone wrote, \"The series constantly feels at war with itself creatively, as if no one involved quite knows exactly what they are making, or at least how to make what they want. But it's fascinating, charming, frequently hilarious, and at times surprisingly moving to watch them try.\" Sean T. Collins of Vulture gave the episode a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"I'm happy to report that compared to all three of its predecessors, Mrs. Davis is shaping up to be a very minor work. No, really, I mean that as a compliment! It's just a fun story about a roguish nun with a grudge against stage magicians who gets recruited to find the Holy Grail to shut down the kindly artificial-intelligence algorithm that has conquered humanity. You know, the usual!\"\n\nJoel Keller of Decider wrote, \"While the first episode of Mrs. Davis took a bit of effort to wrap our minds around, we were hooked on it by the end, thanks in no small part to Betty Gilpin's lead performance.\" Miles Surrey of The Ringer wrote, \"Mrs. Davis won't be for everyone, but given the many WTF moments that make the show unlike anything else on television, it also won't be mistaken for something cooked up by an algorithm.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2023 American television episodes\nAmerican television series premieres\nTelevision episodes written by Damon Lindelof", "unikey": "Mother of Mercy: The Call of the Horse", "summary": "\"Mother of Mercy: The Call of the Horse\" is the series premiere of the American science fiction drama television series Mrs. Davis.

this job asks 100 percent of me and i immediately was like ive been waiting my whole life for this she told the hollywood reporter on thursday night while standing on the blue carpet inside las dga theatre for the premiere it feels like a thousand genres in one and so it was like a cat toy for my brain really a big reason for that is while simone may be a nun on a mission she has a layered backstory that unfolds as the season goes to reveal a depth that gilpin found thrilling it would be spoiling the plot to go into detail so best leave it to gilpin to explain it in broad strokes i feel like i either play these hardened sarcastic sardonic or wry characters or characters who have their arms wide open and are vulnerable and hopeful this character really is both gilpin said she may have started as the first kind but her faith really changed her as a person we see a lot of flashbacks to what she was like before she was a person of faith for myself not being a person of faith it was an

hayespeacock clara mathilde ollivier appears in episode 1 of season 1 of mrs davis photo sophie kohlerpeacock damon as someone who often explores parental trauma and faiths impact on our lives in your series what about simones journey appealed to you damon lindelof cocreator and writeri think that the idea of living in a dickensian construct where parents are fairly terrible and selfish and narcissistic and the kids are now basically working through and trying to absolve themselves of the things that were put on them versus the fundamental parts of their own nature and then to tell it inside of this insane playground definitely felt very familiar to me but i think that when it came to particularly creating this path tara was very resolute  and it was such a northstar for all of us  in saying this is not a story where simones faith is a coping mechanism as you know doesnt have that mystery in her life simone and wylies adventure simone betty gilpin and wiley jake mcdorman appear in episode 1 of season 1 of mrs davis photo colleen hayespeacock betty when tara and damon pitched you the role of simone  lizzie did they give you some insight about how to get your head around playing her betty gilpin sister simone  lizziewhen tara hernandez and damon lindelof and i first talked its so hard to talk about the show without spoiling stuff and they didnt want to spoil anything for me but they still wanted to give me a general idea of what it was about they just gave me the pilot and it was really exciting to me i had done the hunt with damon so i knew that he was a master at creating his own genre and is a genius about hiding your vegetables in that he asks really big thesis statement questions about our society in a very joyful and strange genre way and tara turns out to be a genius at that as well reading the script i was so intrigued by the character and just really marveled at even though its so profoundly strange the whole thing  and id never read anything like it  it really does touch on so many of the things that i wonder about our lives today so i was in what was your first scene playing her and did it help center you for what was to come gilpinthe first scene we shot was the motorcycle chase we did all of that first i remember the production assistant grace gaither saying out on the walkie thats a wrap on the ostriches were moving on to exploding clowns jake mcdorman and i just burst out laughing which set the tone for the rest of the time it was really fun related recap in the series premiere mrs davis leaves us with many questions and few answers jakedid you understand from the audition who wylie was or did that come after you got the role jake mcdorman wileyi think i did i first got the scene but based on that argument in the scene between simone and wiley you could pick up on the fact that heres a guy who is trying to unabashedly win back his ex but pretend like hes not present himself cool like han solo but shes deconstructing that image sentence by sentence with him it does have such a unique tone and tara and damon walked such a fine line where you dont want to play it too silly because on the next page theres some high stakes drama that you want to have people come with you on then i did get a script that was like holy sh this is like an explosion at the emoji factory was there a first scene filmed that helped clarify wiley for you mcdorman one of the first scenes that betty and i did together was that scene under the rock and getting to go toe to toe with with betty was so much fun theres not a better actor to walk that line so perfectly with to really break your heart and go as deep as she can go with the drama and then make you laugh as hard as she does with the comedy shes the perfect instrument to bring that script to life and so just following her lead on that and getting to play on that level set the tone for i think everybody episodes 14 ofmrs davisare now availableon peacock related
