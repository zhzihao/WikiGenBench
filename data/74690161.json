intricate crystal clusters known to bloom in the qatari desert the national museum of qatar nmoq is one of the countrys most iconic buildings while it may seem like youll need all day to explore the jean nouveldesigned museum occupying a vast swath of dohas historical center its exhibition halls occupy only a fraction of the structure opened in 2019 the nmoqs 11 interconnected galleries tell the story of qatar from its geological formation some 700 million years ago to the oilrich nation of 26 million residents today films help to bring many of its expertly curated exhibits to life with audio guides designed to be used both in the museum and at home the discovery of oil in 1939 that launched qatars industrial development propels exhibits into the modern era with possibly the most controversial envelope in sporting history  revealing qatar as the host of the 2022 fifa world cup  among the artifacts on display but the nmoq experience doesnt end there with the visitor trail continuing outside to the restored original palace of sheikh abdullah bin jassim al thani who ruled from 19131949 as the third emir of qatar theres not much to see inside the modest structure yet the traditional building offers a rare glimpse into a bygone era it would be remiss to bypass the gift shop where undulating wooden surfaces that mimic the museums organic form give this surreal space a cavelike feel the museum also has an alain ducasse restaurant jiwan where camel rissoles are known to grace the contemporary qatari menu msheireb museums dohas historical core was controversially razed to construct the citys ultramodern msheireb downtown district in the early 2010s fortunately four neighboring heritage homes were spared by the bulldozers and now house msheireb museums one of dohas most interesting free attractions the largest of the four museums bin jelmood house also explores the most compelling subject matter slavery and the exploitation of human labor while qatars role in both is largely focused on the past the subversive space nonetheless forces visitors from the gulf and beyond to reckon with historical human rights abuses that continue into the 21st century next door is company house an ode to qatars petroleum industry from where a side door leads to the smaller and more interesting radwani house built in the 1920s it has been furnished to present a window into traditional qatari family life during that era across the road mohammed bin jassim house hones in on dohas architectural heritage particularly the redevelopment of msheireb mathaf arab museum of modern art a great excuse to explore dohas futuristic education city precinct the mathaf arab museum of modern art is home to the worlds largest collection of modern and contemporary arab art flanked by a sculpture garden the museum building is somewhat unremarkable for a qatari arts institution but mathaf was never meant to be permanent with french architect jeanfrançois bodin recruited to transform a former school to temporarily house a collection assembled over three decades by sheikh hassan bin mohamed bin ali al thani a cousin of the emir of qatar sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani the mysterious symbols found carved in qatars deserts opened in 2010 mathafs 12 galleries occupy two floors with galleries 17 featuring temporary exhibitions and 812 showcasing a rotating selection of works from the museums 9000strong permanent collection major themes explored in exhibits include the aesthetics and politics of change and progress from the development of the middle easts petroleum industry to the role of women in arab society lightening the mood are colorpopping geometric works by moroccan painter mohamed melehi and lebanese artist gebran tarazi both found in gallery 11 with

are plenty of gems to be discovered including an impressive collection of qurans and a traditional damascene home featuring exquisite tiling and latticework visitors looking for the saddam hussein room will find the contentious exhibition is no longer open to the public but classic car fans wont be left disappointed with around 300 vehicles from the sheikhs immense collection now showcased in an enormous new wing while a significant investment in curation would serve the main museum well the opportunity to peek inside the coffers of one of the worlds 3000 richest people makes it well worth the 30minute uber journey from dohas city center 321 qatar olympic and sports museum its not difficult to guess which other major international sporting event qatar has its sights on hosting at the
