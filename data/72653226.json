Tonally described as \"Dante's Inferno meets Office Space\", Part One was released on April 29; Part Two was released on May 27; Part Three was released on June 24; Part Four was released on September 23; and Part Five was released on October 21 (all in 2020). The series' demonic visions of Rick and Morty were later made available as playable characters in the free-to-play role-playing video game Pocket Mortys.\n\nReceiving a generally positive critical reception, the series will be republished in April 2023 as the first volume of Rick and Morty Deluxe Double Features, an omnibus with Ever After by Sam Maggs and Sarah Stern & Emmett Helen.\n\nOverview\nBased on the same multiple timeline concept as described in the Rick and Morty first season episode \"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\", Rick and Morty Go to Hell follows the alternate universe Smith family from The Rickoning as they descend into Hell after the destruction of their parallel universe at the hands of the Rickluminati's universe-destroying bomb, with no memory of their deaths. As the family separately explore the realm, Summer attempts to find true love, Jerry unwittingly inspires a revolution, and Rick remains in denial as Morty attempts to reach and make a deal with the Devil, Lucifer Morningstar / Lucius Needful (from \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\").\n\nPremise\n\nPart One\nWell, it finally happened. Following The Rickoning, Rick and Morty are in Hell, and we don't mean the DMV. It's fire, brimstone, and torture for all eternity. Typical Rick, he sees a way out of this mess and drags Morty with him on a horrific adventure to speak to…the manager.\n\nPart Two\nHaving filed an appeal with the dark lord almighty, Rick and Morty must begin the treacherous paperwork: enduring circles of Hell leading to the devil himself. First up, Rick and Morty must endure the ultimate regret and shame of a life well-lived…well, lived anyways.\n\nPart Three\nRick and Morty must face horrors of their past within the digestive tract of an unfathomable beast. Meanwhile, a mutiny in Hell begins a brewin' and it's all Jerry's fault, because, of course.\n\nPart Four\nNearing the end of their journey through Hell, Rick and Morty must face their greatest challenge yet, one that will reveal the true nature of their souls. Can our titular heroes overcome the Devil's task before Hell collapses under civil war?\n\nPart Five\nRick and Morty are finally face to face with ol' Lucifer himself, but the hordes of Hell want to cut in line. Can Rick and Morty successfully appeal their case, or are they doomed to suffer for all eternity? The shocking conclusion to Rick and Morty Go to Hell!\n\nDevelopment\nWhile Oni Press' original contract to publish an ongoing comic book series based on the animated series Rick and Morty expired after five years with the publication of the final issue of The Rickoning in March 2020, announced as the conclusion of the series and brand as a whole, Oni Press signed a new contract for a succession of limited-run series from different writer/illustrator teams, beginning with Rick and Morty Go to Hell, an epilogue series to The Rickoning following its alternate reality Rick, Morty, and Smith family as they find themselves in Hell following their deaths (and the destruction of their universe) at the end of The Rickoning. Announced in January 2020, to be written by Ryan Ferrier and illustrated by Constanza Oroza, with a premise of \"Dante's Inferno meets Office Space\", Ferrier described the series as \"some of the best comedy I've [ever] written. And I’ve always had a propensity for writing comedy, and especially satire. I think it's really fun [to bring] a ridiculous amount of laughs [to] the realm of fire and brimstone\", further elaborating on \"wreak[ing] havoc in the Rick and Morty sandbox [as] a total thrill\", describing his collaboration with Oroza as forming a \"phenomenal, equally twisted team [to make] weird, irreverent, and most importantly, funny comics,\" finally summarising the affair as \"Mad science fiction and devil business are two of my favorite things, and we're taking extreme joy in throwing these characters into the figurative and literal fires. Rick and Morty are going to Hell, and we're taking you down with us!\". To promote the series, two different covers drawn by Brian Smith were made available, along with an \"insane\" variant cover limited to 1,000 copies by Zé Burnay made available through Oni's website in the \"Exclusive Editions\" section of their store.\n\nReception\n\nComics XF lauded the overall narrative of Go to Hell for \"only get[ting] sharper and more interesting as Rick and Morty trawl Hell's depths\", in particular bringing attention to the \"remarkable thing from a storytelling standpoint [in] that all of the characters [except Beth have something to do [in] Rick and Morty both mak[ing] some emotional breakthroughs as they react to their various tortures, Jerry tr[ying] to rally the denizens of the underworld against Rick[,] and Summer learn[ing] that courtship is hell everywhere… especially in Hell\", concluding to say the \"narrative depth [of the series] stacks up nicely to any of the show’s episodes and is right there with the best of [Kyle] Starks’ run\" — the \"apex\" of A Tale of Two Jerries.\n\nAaron Phillips of But Why Tho? praised the \"dialogue heavy[,] rip-roaring, existential debate [had by Rick and Morty while they traverse the rocky terrain of [the] afterlife\", with writer Ryan Ferrier having \"done justice to the opening issue in the series by laying the foundations for the plot by having Rick and Morty essentially on opposite ends of the spectrum as they tackle this abstract concept. The joy of the story is in the intelligence of the discussion between the two characters[…] Morty serv[ing] as a good narrative instrument for the visuals we see in the panels [and] Ferrier really test[ing] the limits of Rick’s rationality throughout the issue by throwing obstacle after obstacle, but then counteracts it with a level of reasoning, mixed with a level of disdain at the mere mortals that surround him, that would definitely come from someone with the intellect of Rick Sanchez\", in addition to praising the consistency of Oroza's artwork and Stern’s coloring. Tanner Dedmon of ComicBook.com similarly complimented the series as \"a pretty generic Rick and Morty adventure\" with a \"perfect use of the Rick and Morty formula\".\n\nLucas Fashina of Comic Crusaders lauded Go to Hells continuation of the television series' themes of Rick Sanchez's conflicting views on the existence of God, alternating from openly expressing atheism to recognising (but not respecting) the existence of God and the Devil, not respecting either, but nonetheless fearing death, and the conflicting options of an abyss over Hell, describing the character's initial denial of his damnation as \"puzzling\", praising Constanza Oroza's \"pretty good\" art style while expressing disappointment at a general lack of Easter Eggs, while Jody Cardona of Monkeys Fighting Robots praised \"Oroza['s] fantastic job of capturing the feel of the original series while adding extra details.\" On the resolution of the fifth and final issue of Go to Hell \"wrap[ping] up with a bang\", Jesse Bereta of Bubbleblabber called it \"the stand-out piece of the series. If one were to skip the rest of the books and just read this conclusion, it would be better, and likely still make sense[…] deserv[ing] the recognition of being a good read on its own\".\n\nElvie Mae Parian of WomenWriteAboutComics criticised the series as being \"pretty run-of-the-mill when it comes to any other Rick and Morty story\" in spite of its \"fiery premise\", describing Constanza Oroza's art as \"spot on, perfectly translating the animated series' house style in this comic form with a looser interpretation that is mostly accurate to our familiarity with this cartoon cast. [Sometimes] slightly off-model, but in a way that is intentionally dynamic to add freneticism to the still images\" while comparatively complimenting it in comparison to writer Ryan Ferrier's previous work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Universe and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Stephen Schleicher and Robert Mammone similarly described the series as being as \"competently done\" as The Simpsons Comics, praising \"Ferrier [as having] the characters down pat. Their dialogue, their reactions, all fit[ting] with what we’ve seen in the series\", in particular an \"astonishing juxtaposition of Morty [Smith]'s self-involved lament, with a moment of true mourning [among] stand out laugh lines\" in a rendition of \"Amazing Grace\", positively compared to former U.S. President Barack Obama, while complimenting \"Oroza's artwork [as] evok[ing] the series very well\", with the \"only gripe [of] that if you're going to set a story in Hell, make the surroundings more…hellish\", concluding to state Go to Hell to have been \"a decent stab at transferring the television characters to the printed page [with] the writing more or less match[ing] the tone of the show\".\n\nCollected editions\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Rick and Morty Go to Hell at Oni Press\n\n2020 graphic novels\nGo to Hell\nOni Press titles\nSequel comics\nFiction about the Devil", "unikey": "Rick and Morty – Go to Hell", "summary": "Rick and Morty Go to Hell is a limited series graphic novel, written by Ryan Ferrier, illustrated by Constanza Orozo, and colored by Sarah Stern, which was published in five parts in 2020 by Oni Press, as an epilogue to The Rickoning, the twelfth and final volume of the first ongoing comic series based on the franchise by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon,[7] while also serving as an alternate reality sequel to the television series episode \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\" by Mike McMahan.

volume and concludes a major story arc next weekco oni pressas it initiallyemerged from the primordial sludge of the creative process rick and morty the adult swim series from justin roiland and dan harmon was a demented riff on back to the future a vulgar reimaging of doc with a drinking problem whos saddled with a dopey or maybe dopier depending on your view of the original character marty but like all complex organisms the show has evolved beyond its original premise and over the course of two seasons it has proven to be one of the most creative and insightful shows currently on televisiongiven the shows success and appeal it was only natural to seek outlets beyond cable tv and the crew at comic book publisher oni press has been working with the rick and morty license for almost two years now producing what current series writer kyle starks says amounts to episodes of the television show albeit in print and while there have been changes to the creative team oni press managing editor ari yarwood has been a constant influence on the series recruiting both starks and series colorist katy farina to work on the bookin honor of both the fourth volume of the series now in stores and the conclusion of the masterful doofus jerry story arc out next week in issue 23 we now present part three of a 100year millionarticle series as we talk via email with the rick and morty creative team on what its like to play in such a funny dark and always strange universewere you a fan of the show before you signed on to work on the book what did you think about itkyle starks writer huge fan i was a giant community dan harmons nbc sitcom fan and a huge rick and morty fan i thought and think it  like community  is one of the smartest shows on television its whip smart funny repeatedly astoundingly clever and capable of hitting those great emotional notes its a really great showkaty farina series colorist im a huge fan of the show  i didnt start watching until after season 2 ended but i marathoned it all in one day and have since rewatched it a bunch of times it has such a great mix of humor and fatalism that feels true to our own lived experiences regardless of this fantastical world that rick and morty takes place inmarc ellerby backup writer and artist its an incredible show as soon as the pilot went up i was all in funny dark stupid honest really weird with a copious amount of dick jokesrick and morty vol 4 coverwhat has been your favorite moment of working on the seriesfarina from this arc its definitely been doofus rick and have created you dont have to just make something good  you have to make something that good repeatedly its a high target to aim forellerby thinking about it the biggest challenge is working in four pages for the backups i always always always without fail write too many jokes or too many scenes so stuff always gets cut the first backup i wrote with doofus rick and jerrys day of fun could have been a whole issue i mean just look at what kyle and cj did rightalso whereas its not a challenge per se but the thing im most aware of and the thing i want to get absolutely right is to meet the expectation of the fandom the shows fans are die hard for something that has only 20ish episodes but the fans can smell a rat  they know when somethings not right and i feel that pressure with the book to meet the quality of the show its tough as the show has set an almighty bar but i think we do good jobfarina adapting to the aesthetic of the show was a challenge to begin with i have a habit of adding superfluous details when i color but the show is very clean and precise with its lookkaty what are some of the guiding principles in your approach to coloring the main stories do any of the colors ricks hair mortys shirt etc have specific names whats the hardest one to keep track of or get rightfarina i try to keep the colors for the main series in line with the look of the show and that includes textures and lighting as well its also an excellent excuse to rewatch episodesyou know for reference i really get to mess around with alien worlds which is great if the colors have names im not privy to that information  i just call them rick hair and morty shirt and the like the palettes are all pretty unique to the characters but i have to be careful not to mix up the mouth colors since theyre the most similari have to know more about mouth colors like i cant not ask what those are and why theyre specific to each characterfarina haha well each character has three colors for their mouths  the tonguegums their teeth and the darker inside of the mouth each character has their own unique palettes for them although most characters have white teeth with the exception of rick but they are pretty close in color so its easy for me to accidentally switch rick and mortys palettes or forget to use different palettes for each im not sure the exact decision making that went into making them so varied but i suppose its to keep the colors unified for each characters lookrick and morty 23 page 8issue 23 the final chapter in the doofus jerry story arc is coming out next week what can you say about where the story is goingstarks i can say that i feel like i introduced the biggest threat rick has faced to date and its going to be an epic climax also there is dimension hoppingalso cj hits home runsalso there are

dead end rick and morty go to hell 1 ryan ferrier writer constanza oroza artist sarah stern colorist crank letterer sarah gaydos editor june 10 2020 oni press despite its fiery premise rick and morty go to hell is pretty runofthemill when it comes to any other rick and morty story our two titular characters are caught in something that is probably ricks fault and the rest of the family is unfortunately dragged along in it go tohells shtick is that the situation might actually be irreversible rick and morty crash land in some sort of sprawling underground network of caves where lava runs along like rivers and daylight is nowhere to be found we are not given any clue yet as to what dropped the two here morty justifiably is worried seeing nothing but misery and literal signs of being in an authentic fiery underworld rick on the other hand asserts that he is a man of science and that this facade can easily be explainable through a solution that he just hasnt figured out yet moving forward they later run into other people many of whom rick has crossed in the past and are already known to have died a long time agoanother point towards this loose chance that the duo truly might have also died and truly landed in a doomed afterlife several banterings back and forth and an obvious dmv joke later rick and morty are cornered against a fiery pit of lava before them unsure of what is to come next compared to a previous rick and morty comic i reviewed there is so far nothing that indicates go to hell will be a huge upheaval or subversion to the series morty is constantly victimized by his mad scientist grandfather and we currently do not know what else will be the extent of that go to hells first issue plays out straight with every beat one would see in the animated series in the classic rick and morty way there is an answer to everything and when all will be revealed our staple characters will revert back to their old selves rick and morty truly fits the mold of what a cartoon is in which the world and its eccentric ensemble is flexible enough to create a more expansive universe outside of its typical medium with no consequences or challenges to its canon lead writer ryan ferrier sticks to the script approaching go to hell with his own experience writing for comics of other ip like teenage mutant ninja turtles universe and mighty morphin power rangers constanza orozas art is also spot on perfectly translating the animated series house style in this comic form with a looser interpretation that is mostly accurate to our familiarity with this cartoon cast characters at times go slightly offmodel but in a way that is intentionally dynamic to add freneticism to the still images for fans rick and morty go to hell may likely not offer anything new but it is another snapshot within a wacky world that can be enjoyed in conjunction with the animated series latest season advertisements elvie mae parian elvmaepariangmailcom

mins read rick and morty go to hell 3 writer ryan ferrier artist costanza oroza colorist sarah stern letterer crank editor sarah gaydos  robert meyers publisher oni press price 399 release date august 19th 2020 previously in rick and morty go to hell rick and morty along with the rest of mrtys family have ended up in hell to be honest its where they deserve to be but thats by the by while rick believes there is no hell and this is some sort of trick or hallucination morty falls under the sway of his belief in a christian hell meanwhile well meaning jerry seems to have accidentally started a rebellion amongst the souls of the damned you wont believe its not butter back in the day when your reviewer worked at a news agency and comic book store i was an avid simpsons fan back then as well taping the shows watching as the series became a cultural phenomenon it was really a great time to be alive  the satire was fun and fresh and the series was genuinely funny the simpsons made a hit song and then some genius in marketing thought wow what about a simpsons comic the simpsons comic hit the market with a resounding crash i recall that it was extremely popular especially the first few issues hey it was the 90s  everyone and their dog was piling into comics like they were corn futures i bought the first issue read it and never bought another one again the same issue i had with the simpsons comic is what im feeling having read rick and morty go to hell 3 its very competently done it hits most of the beats of its streaming forebear the artwork is very good and some of the dialog is funny and reminiscent of what i love about the show the characters are on point more or less but rick and morty go to hell 3 doesnt quite live up to the actual viewing experience it has to do with the comic format rick and morty is a lively anarchic feverishly inventive series within one episode the characters are put through the mill in a wide variety of locations it never dawdles or stops to examine its navel too much the main characters are always hopping to the next thing and then the next thing rick and morty go to hell 3 didnt quite meet my expectations the a and b plots all revolve around the same locale rick and morty spend most of the issue navigating the digestive system of a giant sandworm which in and of itself is amusingly gross in the way the series can be amusingly gross but it lacks that sense that anything could happen the television series has in spades and while jerrys actions are in character no one he encounters seems to be suffering enough to want to rise up and take on hells satanic minions it all seems boringly suburban which yes is a type of hell but not the take the series would do but none of this is the fault of the creators within the bounds of the comic book format writer ryan ferrier and artist costanza oroza do an excellent job otherwise in evoking the television series putting aside my reservations above ferrier has the characters down pat their dialogue their reactions all fit with what weve seen in the series mortys whining and self doubt leap off the page and his confession that he ate his goldfish fin diesel to shut summer up is both exactly what morty would do and startlingly hilarious when morty breaks out into amazing grace in memory of his late lamented and undoubtedly tasty fish it instantly reminded me of when former president barack obama sang that same song while eulogising the victims of a mass shooting its that astonishing juxtaposition of mortys self involved lament with a moment of true mourning that provides rick and morty go to hell 3s stand out laugh lines costanza orozas artwork evokes the series very well the characters are as readily identifiable as what you see on your screens but this is in no way a copy and paste project while the settings may feel samesame theres no doubting what the characters are doing and why they are doing it my only gripe is that if youre going to set a story in hell make the surroundings morehellish bottom line facsimile rick and morty go to hell 3 is a decent stab at transferring the television characters to the printed page if the issue had featured more of the series wildly inventive locations and characters it wouldve been a much more entertaining read that said the writing more or less matches the tone of the show and there are some genuinely amusing lines especially from rick and morty if you love the series you will like this comic book dear spoileriteat major spoilers we strive to create original content that you find interesting and

pull list  new comicscc apparelcrusaders team shops search for comic books reviews review rick and morty go to hell 1 by lucas fashina 4 years ago the first thing i thought of when i saw the title is wait a minute rick doesnt believe in heaven or hell so what is happening herehere is why this 5 issue miniseries is so important rick established his atheism in the very first scene of rick and morty there is no god summer he says in the pilot you gotta rip that bandaid off now youll thank me later which kinda made sense hes a scientist and with a lack of evidence in his universe of god he doesnt believe in such a conceptâ also seeing how there are an infinite number of alternate realities there must be one where god and the devil exist rightlater rick turns to praying to godâ in season 2 episode 1after rick morty and summer defeat the fourth dimension being rick finds himself falling to his death through the abyssâ im okay with this rick says resigning himself to deathâ then when he sees the last collar he changes his tune i am not okay with this oh sweet jesus please let me live oh my god i  ive gotta fix this thing please god in heaven  please god oh lord hear my prayersâ at the same time we also see a cut from one or more other possibilities where rick assumes hes about to dieâ prayingplease god if theres a hell please be merciful to me after rick inevitably figures out how to fix the collar and saves himself his triumphant outcry is yes fuck you god not today bitchâ also we know he believes in the devil rick and mortyâdepicted the devil only a few episodes prior inâsomething ricked this way comesin rick and morty go to hell 1 rick seems to deny all of itâ which is puzzling for all the things we already knowâ the art by constanza oroza does not perfectly emulate the show but it is still pretty goodâ i was a little disappointed that there werent more easter eggs the most important thing is that i am now intrigued and cant wait for issue 23 stars out of
