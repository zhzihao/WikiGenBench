{"id": 74436919, "key": "November 2023 Ohio Issue 1", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November%202023%20Ohio%20Issue%201", "text": "The 2023 Ohio reproductive rights initiative, officially titled \"The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety\", and listed on the ballot as Issue 1, is a citizen-initiated constitutional amendment that will appear on the ballot on November 7, 2023. If a for vote passes, the initiative would codify reproductive rights in the Ohio Constitution, including contraception, fertility treatment, whether to continue one's own pregnancy, and miscarriage care. It would restore Roe v. Wade-era access in Ohio, protecting \"the right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability\" while permitting restrictions after.  \n\nIn 2019, the Ohio legislature passed a near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for the health of the mother, rape, incest, or minors. This current statute became briefly active after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. During the time it was in place, multiple children fled the state for abortions after being raped. One of these cases involved a ten-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio who traveled to Indiana to get the procedure, generating nationwide attention and becoming a central issue in the campaign. A state court put the ban on hold while a challenge alleging it violates the Ohio Constitution is heard. In late August 2023, former President Donald Trump condemned six-week abortion bans, including Ohio's, as going \"too far\" and a \"terrible thing and terrible mistake\". The referendum is widely seen as determining whether Ohio's statute will remain in place; several members of the \"against\" campaign called for bans on forms of birth control that prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg and in vitro fertilization if the referendum fails.\n\nThe \"yes\" campaign has drawn support from Ohio medical organizations, doctors, economists, trade unions, editorial boards, reproductive rights groups, and several religious organizations. They have argued that a \"yes\" vote would further what they see as limited government, protect bodily autonomy and religious liberty, while preventing interference with patient-physician privacy. It has run as an ideological big-tent, with \"the main force behind the ballot initiative\" being physicians. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, alongside other professional associations of doctors, has campaigned for Issue 1. \n\nThe \"no\" campaign has mainly drawn support from fundamentalist Protestants. In August 2023, the campaign suffered controversy after Ohio Right To Life's communications director Lizzie Marbach, an evangelical and self-described Christian nationalist, called for restrictions or bans on birth control, statements that the Veneration of Mary in Catholicism is \"idolatry\", and implied that non-Christians would go to hell. Marbach also controversially described the \"against\" campaign as a way to enact fundamentalist Protestant supremacy in law. Former Vice President Mike Pence is expected to campaign against the measure.\n\nText \nBe it Resolved by the People of the State of Ohio that Article I of the Ohio Constitution is amended to add the following Section:\n\nArticle I, Section 22. The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety\n\nA. Every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on:\n\n contraception;\n fertility treatment;\n continuing one’s own pregnancy;\n miscarriage care; and\n abortion\n\nB. The State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against either:\n\n An individual’s voluntary exercise of this right or\n A person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right\n\nunless the State demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.\n\nHowever, abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability. But in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.\n\nC. As used in this Section:\n\n “Fetal viability” means “the point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures. This is determined on a case-by-case basis.”\n “State” includes any governmental entity and any political subdivision.\n\nD. This Section is self-executing.\n\nBackground\n\n2022 Ohio child-rape and Indiana abortion case \n\nIn 2019, the Ohio legislature passed a near-total ban on abortion, without exceptions for the health of the mother, rape, incest, or minors. \n\nThis current statute became briefly active after Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. During the time it was in place, at least multiple children fled the state for abortions after being raped. The most notable case involved a ten-year-old girl from Columbus, Ohio, United States, traveled to Indiana on On June 30, 2022 to get an abortion because current statutory law in Ohio does not provide an exception those who became pregnant because of rape. Her case drew national attention and commentary from public figures, due in part to its proximity to the June 24, 2022, decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states, including Ohio, to impose unlimited limitations on abortion access. \n\nHer rapist was arrested by July 13. Before this arrest was made public, Ohio politicians who oppose legal abortion access called the story a hoax; Ohio's attorney general Dave Yost said, \"Every day that goes by, the more likely that this is a fabrication.\" After news of the arrest validated the Star story, these sources did not apologize for claiming the story was a hoax. Jim Bopp, the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee, said in an interview that the girl should have been forced to bear the child under law, and that \"She would have had the baby, and as many women who have had babies as a result of rape, we would hope that she would understand the reason and ultimately the benefit of having the child.\" In September 2022, shortly after Ohio's 6-week abortion ban went into effect, a woman made national news when she almost bled to death after an Ohio hospital refused to treat her miscarriage. Presently, \"a state court put the ban on hold again while a challenge alleging it violates the state constitution plays out\".\n\nBallot measure submission \nOn February 21, 2023, Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom, the group leading support for the initiative, filed the amendment's language with the office of Ohio Attorney General, Dave Yost, who certified it on March 2, sending it to the Ohio Ballot Board, who further certified the proposed amendment on March 13, permitting supporters to begin collecting signatures. On July 5, supporters filed 709,786 signatures, nearly 300,000 more than the minimum number required. Ohio Secretary of State, Frank LaRose, certified the petition on July 25, 2023, after certifying 495,938 valid signatures, more than the approximately 410,000 required.\n\nAttempt to change threshold \nThe Ohio Republican Party tried to thwart this constitutional amendment by attempting to change the rules so as to increase to 60% the threshold required for referendum passage in an August 8 special election, known as August 2023 Ohio Issue 1. The voters of Ohio rejected this change 57%-43%, keeping the threshold for passage at 50%+1.\n\nBallot challenge rejected\nOn August 11, the Ohio Supreme Court unanimously rejected a lawsuit filed July 28 that would keep the initiative off the ballot.\n\nCampaign \nThe \"for\" campaign drew support from Ohio scientific and medical communities, economists, trade unions, editorial boards, human rights, and many religious organizations. They have argued that a \"yes\" vote would limit government, protect bodily autonomy and religious liberty, and prevent interference with personal medical decisions, including another situation similar to the aforementioned abortion case. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology, alongside other professional associations of physicians, will prominently campaign for the citizen-initiated constitutional amendment. \"The main force behind the ballot initiative\" has been physicians and other groups in medicine. \n\nWhile several Ohio's Catholic dioceses condemned the measure, many Catholic voters are expected to vote for \"yes\", along with several dissenting groups, including Catholics for Choice.\n\nControversies\n\nComments by Ohio Right to Life activist Lizzie Marbach \n\nThe \"against\" campaign has suffered from intense infighting after comments made by Lizzie Marbach. A fundamentalist Protestant who was communications director for Ohio Right To Life, she labeled a depiction of Our Lady of Guadalupe in a Catholic Church as \"idolatry\", implied that non-Christians would go to hell, and repeatedly called for an end to the separation of church and state. Marbach has since proceeded to describe the \"against\" campaign as a means of enacting fundamentalist Protestant supremacy in law, and called for restrictions or bans on birth control and in vitro fertilization if the referendum fails. After  comments described as anti-Jewish and anti-Catholic, she was fired in mid-August 2023. Jewish Republican congressmen Max Miller (OH-7) responded to Marbach on Twitter that \"this is one of the most bigoted tweets I have ever seen\" and to \"delete it, Lizzie.\" The conversation continued with Miller stating that \"God says that Jewish people are the chosen ones, but yet you say we have no hope. Thanks for your pearl of wisdom today\" and that \"religious freedom in the United States applies to every religion\". Several Catholic anti-abortion activists urged opponents of the measure to not cast a ballot, or, cast one intentionally spoiled as a protest vote in the wake of the controversy, stating that the \"against\" campaign was furthering anti-Catholicism.\n\nBallot wording and misleading campaign advertisements \nProponents of the amendment initially suggested that the amendment appear in full on voters' ballots in November. However, the Ohio Ballot Board substituted its own summary wording to appear before voters. The summary, written by Ohio Secretary of State and Republican Senate candidate Frank LaRose and approved by the Ballot Board's Republican majority, received criticism for its allegedly biased language, including substituting the word \"unborn child\" for the medically accurate term \"fetus\" and omitting reference to other rights the proposed amendment would protect, including contraception, miscarriage care, and fertility treatment. Abortion rights groups sued to have the full text of the amendment presented on the ballot, but the Republican majority on the Ohio Supreme Court sided with the Ballot Board, allowing the contentious language to appear in the ballot summary.\n\nThe Ballot Board's summary received criticism from medical groups as well as some voices opposed to legal abortion access, who have described it as deliberately deceiving voters to vote \"no\" under false pretexts. National conservative columnist Jude Russo wrote that \"[we] have failed to persuade the American people. Simply put: Lawyerly tricks (and tricky lawyers) are losers. Asking the commons to cede power voluntarily is a loser\" and that \"a rush of [intentionally] badly-worded state referenda is not a program.\" The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology stated: \"The language used to discuss abortion has a profound impact on how people form their opinions about reproductive health care, and the emotionally charged language that will now be presented to voters is neither clinically nor legally sound.\"  \n\nAdvertisements from the \"against\" campaign falsely claiming that the referendum would take away parental rights and force transgender surgery on children has received widespread criticism from legal experts who described it as misleading and baseless.  Constitutional law expert Jonathan Entin writes:The opponents are saying, \"Well, but there's this language that says 'including but not limited to'...\" But that's bogus.and:If you drink too much alcohol, if you ingest certain drugs, if you drive too fast — all of those things could have shorter or longer term implications for your ability to reproduce... That doesn't mean that speed limits and drug laws and alcohol regulations are somehow going to be affected by this amendment if it's adopted.Anti-abortion Catholic columnist Mary Pezzulo criticized the advertisements: \"They’re claiming that the constitutional amendment will somehow lead to children being allowed to get gender transition surgery without their parents knowing or being able to stop it. Again, this is nonsense. Children can’t get elective medical procedures without a parent’s consent. And the proposed amendment says absolutely nothing about gender transition.\" and that \"they’re lying to get people to vote against Issue One.\" \n\nShe went on to state:Opposing abortion is supposed to be all about the personhood of the unborn baby. Why are we [lying] about parents’ rights [being taken away]?\n\nEndorsements\n\nPolling\n\nSee also\nAbortion in Ohio\nInitiatives and referendums in the United States\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\"The Right to Reproductive Freedom with Protections for Health and Safety\" official text at Ohio Attorney General\nOhio Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative (2023) at Ballotpedia\n\nOhio Issue 1, 11/2023\nAbortion in the United States\nAbortion referendums\nOhio ballot measures\nUnited States state abortion legislation\nWomen in Ohio\nU.S. state constitutional amendments", "unikey": "November 2023 Ohio Issue 1", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Text", "Background", "Campaign", "Endorsements", "Polling", "Financial_contributions", "Results_by_county", "Reaction", "Voter_demographics", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Be it Resolved by the People of the State of Ohio that Article I of the Ohio Constitution is amended to add the following Section:\nArticle I, Section 22.

It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1\".\nTwo days after the result, Ohio State RepresentativesJennifer Gross,Bill Dean, Melanie Miller, and Beth Lear, all Republicans, released a statement calling Issue 1 \"deceptive\", declaring that \"Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative\" so that only Ohio legislators can \"consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws\", instead of Ohio courts.\nRick Santorum, a Republican and former U.S. Senator, commented on the result of Issue 1 anda simultaneous Ohio voter ballot measure successfully legalising recreational marijuana: \"You put very sexy things like abortion and marijuana on the ballot, and a lot of young people come out and vote. It was a secret sauce for disaster in Ohio …pure democraciesare not the way to run a country.\"Conservative commentatorSean Hannityurged Republicans to adopt a \"safe, legal, and rare\" framework on abortion.\nAccording to Jessie Hill, professor and associate dean at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, the only way the Issue 1 amendment could be challenged is if there were a change to federal law regarding abortion or if another Ohio constitutional amendment restricting abortion was passed, which would mean another election that over 50% of Ohio voters would need to approve.\nOn December 15, 2023, TheOhio Supreme Courtdismissed the state of Ohio's challenge to a lower court ruling from Hamilton County which stayed Ohio's 6-week abortion ban.

republican politicians to make it harder for voters to amend the state constitution by a 14point margin last month now abortionrights supporters are suing many of those same republicans accusing those on the ohio ballot board of blatant inaccuracies in the language they voted to put on the ballot but as the abortion debate has raged theres been a lot of focus on the medical implications of ohios harsh restrictions and less on their economic impact on ohio women of limited means some data suggest that women have gotten abortions because they at least think they cant support the child if the pregnancy is carried to term in 2021 61 of women who got abortions in ohio already had children while 32 did not and another 7 didnt report that information according to the ohio department of health in addition black people make up about 14 of the states population but they have a poverty rate of almost 28 which is nearly three times the poverty rate among white people because of that its perhaps not surprising that even though black people make up only about oneseventh of the female population in 2021 they got almost half of the abortions 49 while it appears that many ohio women get abortions on the calculation that they dont have the resources to support another baby most economists surveyed by the columbus firm scioto analysis said they thought protecting abortion rights would help

educational attainment higher labor force participation and higher wages thirteen of the 18 agreed they would the others were uncertain there is some good research showing that better economic outcomes do arise robert gitter of ohio wesleyan university said in the comments section of the survey it is generally lowerincome women who cannot travel outofstate that benefit economically from the

economist who was uncertain michael jones of the university of cincinnati said the economic question was beside the point taking the life of an innocent baby is evil and immoral he said framing this decision as an economic one shows the depravity of our society jonathan andreas of bluffton university said such arguments illustrate why abortion is so fraught an issue  the clear economic benefits to women of abortion are never going to be nearly big enough to convince anyone who thinks that abortion is murder to change their mind he wrote all other costs and benefits are trivial in comparison

which the board was supposed to conduct their business this is a dangerous amendment that im going to fight tirelessly against gavarone said but thats not why were here today gavarone also claimed as antiabortion groups throughout the state do as well that the amendment is an assault on parental rights neither the amendment nor the summary approved by the board mention parental rights of any kind the senator continued her comments during the board meeting saying the true nature of the amendment is hidden behind overly broad language despite the fact that the board summary took out pieces of the full text the summary passed by the board does not include a list of the rights to reproductive decisions spelled out in the ballot measure including contraception fertility treatment continuing ones own pregnancy and miscarriage care all of which would be impacted under the new constitutional amendment a clause in the proposed amendment that says the state shall not directly or indirectly burden penalize prohibit interfere with or discriminate against the exercise of the amendment by an individual or an assistant of the individual was reduced to the citizens of the state of ohio in the

for reproductive rights requesting that the ballot language mirror the amendment itself so voters could see the entire constitutional change when they vote in november lauren blauvelt a member of the coalition decried the changes made to the language and said the group is considering a lawsuit to fight back the entire summary is really propaganda and we are going to talk about all of the reasons why ohio voters should just be able to see the language for what it is blauvelt said after the board meeting antiabortion groups argued against using the full text saying it was unnecessary and ohio right to life president mike gonidakis pushed back on calls for a lawsuit against the summary any litigation filed on this is going to be thrown out by the ohio supreme court because the statutory responsibility of the ballot board is to provide a fair and accurate representation thats what the law requires and thats what they did today gonidakis said gonidakis said he did not work with anyone on the ballot board on the summary language but he wished the language was stronger mike gonidakis president of ohio right to life talks to the press after the ohio ballot board meeting thursday photo by graham stokes for ohio capital journal republish photo only with original article look at the end of the day people are going to make up their minds before they go in the ballot box anyways and theyre not going to go in and then try to figure out what they want to do by reading something on a screen he said the proposed amendment has gone through a rollercoaster of activity since the ohio ballot board approved the measure in march as compliant with the regulations for a constitutional amendment proposal allowing a petition campaign that resulted in nearly 500000 supporting signatures from ohio voters amid all the necessary hoops through which the abortion rights campaign has jumped abortion rights groups have also had to battle against lawsuits attempting to block the amendment from voters another lawsuit alleged the ohio ballot board hadnt taken enough time or consideration before certifying that the amendment was compliant the ohio supreme court rejected both lawsuits

marijuana two top statehouse republicans floated the notion of chipping away at or altering both measuresas of about 1030 pm a constitutional amendment establishing a right to abortion access passed 555 to 445 marijuana passed by roughly 56 to 44 per preliminary resultsregardless house speaker jason stephens and senate president matt huffman  both of whom oversee broad republican majorities in the general assembly  suggested plans to chip away at ohioans new rightson abortion stephens said in a statement that the state legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life this loss he added is not the end of the conversationhuffman via a spokesman made similar remarksthis isnt the end it is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace issue 1 he saidon marijuana huffman said lawmakers may consider amending the new state law to clarify the questionable language regarding limits for thc and tax rates as well as other parts of the statute stephens suggested lawmakers would alter how tax revenue from marijuana sales is allocatedinvesting in county jail construction and funding law enforcement training across ohio should be our top priority to make our communities safer he saida spokesman for gov mike dewine said the office would not be issuing any statement tuesday eveningthe vote shows a yawning gap between the will of the voters and that of lawmakers bills to expand abortion access or create a recreational marijuana program in ohio have been introduced over the years theyve failed to develop any real tractiontom haren a spokesman for the campaign backing recreational marijuana said voters spoke and lawmakers should respect thatthis was a landslide victory and i cant believe that in 2023

mary pezzulo 0 comments ohios abortion amendment why is the prolife movement lying september 13 2023 mary pezzulo i keep seeing signs telling me to vote no on issue one and this time theyre not talking about augusts issue one where republican lawmakers attempted to yank ohioans ability to amend our constitution we voted that one down by a huge margin almost a supermajority these are about the november election when ohioans will vote on a constitutional amendment prohibiting state laws that ban abortion up until viability or birth control im not surprised that many people here in steubenville are against issue one and want laws banning abortion but i was surprised at the tag line under vote no most of the signs say protect parents rights protect parents rights why would they say that why wouldnt they say protect the lives of unborn babies thats what weve been fighting for all this time isnt it unborn babies thats what i was told when my confirmation class took buses to washington to the march for life we had picket signs with pictures of chubby babies on them we wore lapel pins with the precious feet somebody had a sign with horton the elephant on it that said a persons a person no matter how small we got free bumper stickers with abortion stops a beating heart printed over a jagged line even though none of us were old enough to have cars opposing abortion is supposed to be all about the personhood of the unborn baby why are we talking about parents rights at first i was confused and thought it was to do with giving the parent the right to choose whether to get an abortion which would make voting yes a vote for parents rights of course thats not what theyre talking about theyre not talking about the parent of the baby at all theyre talking about the grandparents of the baby the prolife movement is using scare tactics claiming that the constitutional amendment will allow planned parenthood to give a minor an abortion without their parents consent or knowledge which is ludicrous and beside the point if abortion is wrong its not wrong because parents should get a say its wrong because the baby is a person the rest of the vote no on issue one signs in my neighborhood sport a different logo protect our children and again i thought that was an odd way of saying that we should protect the lives of unborn children but again it isnt it turns out that this too is part of a scare campaign to claim that issue one will hurt children i mean born children without their parents consent theyre claiming that the constitutional amendment will somehow lead to children being allowed to get gender transition surgery without their parents knowing or being able to stop it again this is nonsense children cant get elective medical procedures without a parents consent and the proposed amendment says absolutely nothing about gender transition its about reproductive choices abortion miscarriage care contraception its only a couple hundred words you can read the whole thing in thirty seconds it turns out that these scare campaigns are being deliberately pushed by a prolife outfit called protect women ohio and theyre lying to get people to vote against issue one the ohio right to life isnt innocent of spreading this nonsense either heck even jim caviezel is involved in this shenanigan why are they doing itwhy is it necessary i dont think that babies should be hurt or killed is actually a noncontroversial stance few people if any would oppose you on that and then you could go about arguing your position that an unborn baby is a baby which would involve knowledge of biology and medicine and talking to people who saw things differently than you did and then with our knowledge of biology and medicine and our moral convictions maybe we could sit down and map a course that respects the health safety and rights of the two people involved a mother and a baby we could decide what to do about all the tragic and horrific gray areas that dont get talked about very much like the many cases where a baby is terminal but not quite dead yet and putting the mother in danger we could work for a more just world this constitutional amendment will somehow secretly lead to children getting lateterm abortions and genital surgery behind their parents backs by a secret means i cant really explain is not something somebody says if theyre working for a just world if the prolife movement is really on the side of the angels why are they constantly pulling nonsense like this why do they do so many underhanded and terrible things if they really respect unborn babies and think of them as persons with dignity and rights why so many stolen and exploited corpses for example who would treat a human they respected that way if theyre really standing up for truth why do they lie so often if they want justice why do they want to take away our ability to vote if they really respect life from conception until natural death why the racism the vaccine conspiracy theories the sadism unless of course being prolife isnt really about any of the things i was told again and again i come back to that being prolife isnt about babies at all it isnt about a person being a person no matter how small its about something else altogether i dont think a reasonable person can deny that at this point that infuriates me and makes me sad it ought to be about persons but its not politics and religion abortion abortion abortion ban ohio prolife protect women ohio right to life previous post september 12 2023 rattling the tin cup for autumn

pregnant in july it was her first pregnancy at age 33  everything was new but during the ultrasound at her initial prenatal appointment in washington dc there was no heartbeat bloodwork taken a few days apart showed her pregnancy hormone levels were dropping a doctor from her obgyns office called her to confirm that the pregnancy had ended in a miscarriage they laid out her options take medication to make the pregnancy tissue come out faster have a dilation and curettage or dc procedure to remove the pregnancy tissue from her uterus or wait for it to come out on its own the doctor suggested she wait but didnt tell her how long that can take after a few weeks with no change she looked online and read that for some people it takes weeks before vaginal bleeding starts so i counted myself as one of those women  it was just taking longer for my body  and i tried to put it out of my mind she says soon after that zielke and her husband greg holeyman took the sevenhour drive from dc to northeast ohio for a wedding party for her younger brother on the drive to ohio i had some really heavy bleeding  to the point we had to stop and clean out the car and change all the clothes she says she assumed her body had passed the pregnancy tissue and that was really probably it but that wasnt it the next night at around 4 am she started to bleed again  a lot shots  health news how has

says the couple was confused by this it felt to them like zielke was still experiencing a medical emergency they said they needed to prove there was no fetal development she says i was told that i could come back in two days for a repeat hormone test to confirm i was miscarrying zielke objected  she told them she already had that laboratory confirmation of the miscarriage weeks earlier in dc she tried to show them her medical records on her phone and offered her obgyns contact information but she says she didnt get a response katie watson bioethicist lawyer and professor at northwestern university holeyman zielkes husband says hospital staff seemed hesitant the two of them wondered at the er if that was because of ohios new sixweek abortion ban i wish someone had come out and said hey this is a state law this is what were afraid of and was a little more frank he says instead he says paraphrasing what he heard it was well we dont know if this is viable this could still be viable this is the information you got in dc but we need to confirm it zielke says she didnt want to leave the er but she didnt know how to protest on discharge papers where she had to sign she says she wrote i disagree then she and her husband drove about twenty minutes back to her dads house at this point im assuming that the worst has passed me she says as much as she was scared to leave she thought the bleeding would stop and she would start feeling better but when she pulled up to her dads house i didnt make it back through the door again until there was blood running down into my shoes the situation christina zielke was discharged from an er in ohio without treatment for her miscarriage even though shed been bleeding profusely for hours the state law when zielke was in ohio in early september the state had a law known as a heartbeat bill in effect which bans abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy the law was passed in 2019 and went into effect the same day the supreme court overturned roe v wade on june 24 in midseptember a judge in hamilton county blocked the law ohios republican attorney general has begun the appeals process and the case is ultimately expected to go to the state supreme court health care providers who violate the law face fifthdegree felony charges up to a year in prison loss of their medical license and fines up to 20000 whats at stake ohios abortion restriction doesnt explicitly restrict the treatment of miscarriages or emergency care but it can have that effect anyway health care providers use the same clinical tools to manage a miscarriage as they do to perform abortions  the medications and surgical options are identical that can mean when someone seeks care during a miscarriage a pharmacist or doctor who suspects a patient is seeking an abortion might deny or delay providing treatment fearing prosecution shots  health news at 18 weeks pregnant she faced an immense decision with just days to make it shots  health news heres where abortions are now banned or severely restricted a miscarriage may urgently need those medical interventions when it doesnt resolve on its own explains dr kamilah dixon assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the ohio state university who was not involved in christina zielkes care heavy bleeding can occur if the miscarriage had started and theres still pregnancy tissue inside of the uterus she explains thats because the tissue can interfere with the normal contractions of the uterus which help shut down small blood vessels and control bleeding another risk during a miscarriage is that the retained pregnancy tissue causes an infection which can lead to a potentially lifethreatening infection in the blood called sepsis the way to stop heavy bleeding or to address an infection from an incomplete miscarriage is with a dc dixon says basically its a procedure where we put instruments inside of the uterus to remove the pregnancy tissue she explains ohios heartbeat law states that abortion procedures are legal when there is a medical emergency or medical necessity whether or not the pregnancy could still be viable however in the months after roe v wade was overturned when this law was in effect there were numerous reports of doctors being unsure of what qualifies for this exception leading them to delay care another hour of bleeding passes and i say i dont think this is right i dont think we should have come home christina zielke cnn reported that tara george was denied an abortion by a hospital lawyer even though her fetus had lethal fetal anomalies and continuing the pregnancy put her health at risk and in an affidavit filed in the case challenging the heartbeat bill dr david burkons said that two patients with ectopic pregnancies which can be dangerous were seen by er physicians who were afraid to treat them without being absolutely certain there was no intrauterine pregnancy in one case the patients fallopian tube later ruptured because of reports like this from around the country the federal government sent every hospital a letter in july reminding them a federal law called the emergency medical treatment and active labor act or emtala supercedes state abortion restrictions when theres a conflict between them katie watson a bioethicist and lawyer and professor at northwestern university says some health care providers dont seem to understand that emtala provides solid legal cover for treating pregnant patients in medical crisis were in a moment of tremendous fear and were working with hospitals and doctors who are not fans of liability she says that has led to situations where physicians or staff say only if i think im 1000 safe will i do necessary potentially lifesaving medical care university hospitals which runs tripoint medical center declined a request for an interview about zielkes care citing patient privacy in a statement spokesperson george stamatis wrote university hospitals complies with ohio laws our position is always that health care decisions are best made between the patient and her physician zielke thinks the requirement to have proof that she had had a miscarriage could have cost me my life that day she later filed complaints with the ohio hospital and her obgyn in dc meredith rizzonpr hide caption toggle caption meredith rizzonpr the impact when she came home from the hospital christina zielke was still bleeding so she climbed back into the empty bathtub her family made some eggs and got her gatorade to try to build up her strength another hour of bleeding passes and i say i dont think this is right she says i dont think we should have come home again her husband helped her call an advice line and a nurse told them right away that they needed to go back to the hospital by then it was around 11 am  shed been bleeding profusely since 4 am  for seven hours i tell my husband alright i just need a minute or two to wash off get myself clean enough to get out of this tub she had been taking photos each time the bottom of the tub filled with blood just trying to prove what was happening because i felt like i wasnt believed she says her husband came to help her get up thats when i started to feel the world slip away she says i looked at him and i said i dont think im okay shed lost so much blood so quickly her blood pressure had plummeted holeyman watched as her eyes rolled back her body went limp  she lost consciousness he caught her neck so she didnt bang her head against the tub i thought she was a goner he says he yelled to her stepmom to call 911 then zielkes eyes opened again and he reassured her that an ambulance was coming telling her just keep breathing stay calm he recalls when the paramedics arrived they used a sheet to pull her out of the bathtub onto a stretcher just hours after being discharged she says she was back in the very same er she doesnt remember much from the period after she fainted but she knows she was given iv fluids and warmed up blood samples showed her hemoglobin level had dropped from 125 grams per deciliter that morning to 97 gdl in the afternoon that is a fairly significant blood loss says dr nicole veitinger of the ohio chapter of the american college of emergency physicians the fact that she had enough loss in a short amount of time to pass out certainly would be concerning after a few hours in the er zielke was admitted to the obgyn department of the hospital and had a dc under general anesthesia she was given the option to stay overnight and recover but chose to go home that evening it wasnt a place i felt safe she says shots  health news because of texas abortion law her wanted pregnancy became a medical nightmare the policy debate mike gonidakis president of the advocacy group ohio right to life which lobbied to pass the heartbeat bill argues that what happened to zielke  based on her account  was not a result of ohios law this woman obviously was having a medical issue based on a miscarriage he says this really has nothing to do with abortion  the baby did not have a beating heart gonidakis who serves on the state medical board disputes the idea that the abortion law is unclear about what constitutes an emergency or that it is causing physicians to delay or deny necessary care there are exceptions for those types of situations in the law he says what were seeing i fear is doctors with an agenda saying well i dont know what to do when in fact they do npr has found no evidence of this in the case of zielkes care jessie hill law professor at case western reserve university who serves as a volunteer attorney for the aclu of ohio in the case challenging the states abortion law calls it appalling to suggest that doctors would harm patients to advance a political agenda it is the classic move to stigmatize providers to push this off on to them and suggest that they should understand the law the way a lawyer does walk all the way up to the line of what may or may not be legal she agrees with gonidakis that  based on zielkes account of her experience at the er  theres nothing explicitly in the law that would have prevented her from being treated but she says when an abortion law puts doctors in the position of facing criminal prosecution prison time fines loss of your medical license  its entirely rational for doctors to steer clear when in doubt of violating the law neither the primary sponsor of the heartbeat bill ohio senator kristina roegner nor senate president matt huffman  both republicans  agreed to nprs request for an interview for this story ohios legislature is republicancontrolled and leaders are reportedly considering a vote on legislation to ban abortion at conception  even earlier than the sixweek limit  before the end of the year the patients perspective christina zielke says she doesnt know for sure why she got sent home without care the first time she went to the hospital but she thinks the requirement to have proof that it was really a miscarriage could have cost me my life that day christina zielke she is grateful for the care she got from the paramedics who pulled her out of the bathtub before we left ohio we took some ice cream bars by the fire station to thank them she says she filed an internal complaint with the obgyn practice in dc that didnt adequately counsel her when she first learned about her miscarriage her doctor was very apologetic she says and assured her that if and when she gets pregnant again she wont be left on her own she also filed a complaint with the ohio hospital i had spent so much of the day fighting to feel seen and taken care of she says it was such a traumatizing experience she is also dealing with bills from two separate outofnetwork er visits totaling more than 10000  and the bills keep coming its taken dozens of calls and emails with multiple insurance companies and providers and not one of them is sorted physically shes recovering

activists are now gathering signatures to get the measure on the ballotantiabortion coalition protect women ohio pwo is fighting the amendment spending millions to buy air time and digital ads focusing on parental consent  not just for abortion  but also for transgender genderaffirming careclaimthe abortion amendment will allow for and even push for sex changes for minors without parental consent the ad erroneously claims under their proposed amendment to the ohio constitution the state shall not interfere with individuals getting abortions or sex changes meaning you could be cut out of the biggest decision of her life the ad narrator says as sadlooking caucasian people hug cry and look into mirrorsyoung girls are vulnerable and also online which makes parents fear the worst the ad continuespushed to change her sex or to get an abortion  you have some right to help her through this but activists want to take all that away the ad baselessly assertsanalysiserin upchurch works with lgbtq kids and their families at kaleidoscope youth center she explained that nothing in the amendment would change the standards of care for transgender minorsi was shocked at the level of opportunism thats being utilized to just throw something in there and its not the truth upchurch said it just literally isnt truethe direct language of the bill states every individual has a right to make and carry out ones own reproductive decisions including but not limited to decisions on contraception fertility treatment continuing ones own pregnancy miscarriage care and abortion but the antiabortion ads say differentlyin an interview with news 5 statehouse reporter morgan trau ohio right to lifes mike gonidakis said parental consent will be taken away if the amendment passes his organization is part of pwowhen asked where the amendment explicitly states anything about transgender care gonidakis asked to take a break from the interview to chat without being recorded trau denied the breakthe actual wording is of the language less than 250 words it says the state shall not interfere with any reproductive rights gonidakis said and it also lists abortion so its not just abortiontrau asked what that has to do with transgender care i think if an individual wants to go through the actual procedure to change their gender that would that would fall under the umbrella of reproductive rights gonidakis saidthe language is vague enough that genderaffirming care could be considered he said genderaffirming care especially for minors has nothing to do with reproductive rights said upchurch who is also a clinician it is not deemed as such medically or in the standards of care she saidnonpartisan constitutional law expert jonathan entin agreed with upchurchthe opponents are saying well but theres this language that says including but not limited to entin said but thats bogusnothing in the amendment speaks to transgender care the expert added saying this is a wide stretch at bestthe claim that this is some kind of mechanism for sneaking transgender rights into the ohio constitution is just wrong entin said its dishonestsome kinds of genderaffirming care like surgery on genitalia might in some way have some bearing on ones ability to reproduce entin said but so do plenty of other things he addedif you drink too much alcohol if you ingest certain drugs if you drive too fast  all of those things could have shorter or longer term implications for your ability to reproduce the legal expert said that doesnt mean that speed limits and drug laws and alcohol regulations are somehow going to be affected by this amendment if its adoptedthe antiabortion opposition is desperate and intentionally distorting what is clearly written in order to completely misrepresent the intent and impact of our amendment said celina coming spokesperson for ohioans for reproductive freedom in a statement to news 5 ohioans know the truth and wont be fooled by the outright lies of the advertisementsif people think the pwo ad is wrong they should file a complaint gonidakis saidwe are focusing our efforts and spending our time engaging with the grassroots

ohiodewine publicly supported issue 1 but kept a lower profile than some other state republicans during the campaign leading to criticism from some abortion opponents after issue 1s defeat dewine signaled to reporters last week he plans to speak often against the abortion amendment in the coming weeks calling it too liberal for ohio he declined to elaborate on thursday but a spokesperson emphasized the governors past comments that he plans to be in the public eye when it comes to the issuethe ohio catholic conference the organization that represents ohios catholic bishops meanwhile officially was neutral on issue 1 although some church officials like columbus bishop earl fernandes urged parishioners to vote for the measure issue 1 would have made it harder for the november abortion amendment and other constitutional amendments in the future to pass by requiring a 60 supermajority vote instead of a 50 majoritythe ohio catholic conference has said it will oppose the november abortionrights amendment though writing in an open letter in february that the measure threatens the dignity of life in its earliest stages the catholic church has been a major opponent to abortion proposals in other states giving at least 6 million to an unsuccessful effort to oppose a similar amendment in michigan last yearother coverage coverage of the ohio abortion rightsconference officials werent available for comment for this story but executive director brian hickey told crux a catholic publication last week that the church plans to have priests speak about the issue from the pulpit among other initiatives amy natoce a spokesperson for protect women ohio said the group is thrilled to have the catholic churchs backingcertainly having their support is crucial natoce saidits no surprise to see a politician trying to insert government into personal decisions that should be between a family said gabriel mann a spokesperson for ohioans united for reproductive rights the campaign backing the abortionrights amendmentthe dioceses and archdioceses in cleveland cincinnati and columbus directly gave a total of 900000 to protect women ohio earlier this year state campaignfinance records showabortionrights supporters so far have outraised abortion opponents 97 million to 53 million amendment backers have said they plan to raise and spend as much as 35 million to help pass the amendmentthe proposed amendment would generally guarantee that patients could make their own reproductive decisions including birth control fertility treatment continuing a pregnancy or abortion and miscarriage care up until viability which is around 22 to 24 weeksafter that point the state could regulate abortion however abortions after that cutoff could be permitted if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patients treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or healthas they did in michigan last year opponents have said the amendment allows for legal abortion too late into a pregnancy applies to minors and that the life or health exemption is too broadsupporters have described the language as like the standard under roe v wade the exact effects of the amendment wont be clear until they get decided by courts if the measure passes although the ohio supreme court has given significant weight to how amendment campaigns described their intended effects to the public when interpreting potentially vague amendment languageabortionamendment opponents also have said the measure could allow children to get gender reassignment

fernandes jul 16 2023 faith bishop earl fernandes my dear brothers and sisters in christ in may all priests in every parish and diocese in ohio were asked to make known the position of the ohio catholic conference regarding the upcoming november ballot initiative to remove any restrictions on abortion in the state of ohio the amendment attacks the fundamental understanding of the human person made in gods image and likeness undermines a fundamental anthropology removes rights from parents could potentially jeopardize the conscience rights of medical professionals and represents an assault on human life and the human family once more i urge all catholics to register to vote and to vote no on the proposed amendment in november upon hearing the priests preach on this issue i received a number of letters stating that the church should not be involved in politics and that the church should not speak on these types of political issues the issue of abortion is a fundamental moral issue touching upon issues vital not only to our lives as catholics and the lives of vulnerable unborn children but also to the common good moral issues are routinely addressed from our pulpits and preaching about these moral issues serves to inform our consciences more fully so that we may participate in the political process to build a culture of life and to defend the weak and the vulnerable in his encyclical letter the gospel of life st john paul ii wrote what is urgently called for is a general mobilization of consciences and a united ethical effort to activate a great campaign in support of life all together we must build a culture of life ev 95 the saintly pontiff also reminded us that the first and fundamental step towards this cultural transformation consists informing consciences with regard to the incomparable and inviolable worth of every human life it is of the greatest importance to reestablish the essential connection between life and freedom these are inseparable goods where one is violated the other also ends up being violated ev 96 some of the letters said that priests said that if one does not vote no in november one commits a mortal sin and that the church should not be telling people how to vote is this the case as a moral theologian i can say that one commits a mortal sin when there is grave matter involved when one knows the churchs teaching or the truth of the matter and one freely chooses the evil anyway how you vote is a matter of your conscience and will involve your freedom however conscience is informed by scripture tradition the magisterium of the church and reason each person bears moral responsibility for his or her vote as chief shepherd of the diocese of columbus i must state that we cannot remain indifferent to the plight of the unborn one need only think of the parables of the good samaritan the rich man and lazarus or the last judgment nor can we as catholics remain silent in the face of grave injustice others objected that in the united states there is a separation between church and state although the constitution ensures separation of church and state that is largely to prevent the government from intruding into religious affairs and to prevent religious groups from running the government it does not mean that catholics and other religious groups should keep their faith private nor does it mean that they should not be involved in the political process to shape a better civilization and to promote the common good in fact because god has so blessed us we have perhaps an even greater responsibility toward our brothers and sisters born and unborn i encourage all the faithful not only to pray for an end to abortion but to use your freedom through the political process to help build a culture of life in which every person is valued cared for and respected no matter how the election goes in november we as catholics have a duty to defend the rights of unborn children and to continue to accompany women and their children putting our faith into action may the virgin mary the mother of the redeemer and st joseph the protector of the holy family assist us in our vocation

yes on issue 1 this november the editorial board strongly encourages people to vote yes on issue 1 and 2 and no on issue 20 issue 1 the right to make reproductive decisions including abortion initiative involves protecting all forms of reproductive health care in the state essentially codifying them into the state constitution this editorial board believes that the health care protected by issue 1 is important to the state of ohio and students at oberlin college after roe v wade was overturned in june 2022 a ban on abortions after six weeks was instituted shortly afterward which was previously vetoed in 2019 on sept 14 2022 a lower court in ohio blocked this ban however if issue 1 does not pass it would mean that the sixweek ban could be reinstated ohioans who need abortions would then have to travel to pennsylvania or michigan to get these restrictive bans such as this have had devastating effects across the country fourteen states have completely banned abortion and two states  georgia and south carolina  uphold the sixweek ban along with the devastating health effects abortion bans have the most significant effect on people of color primarily lowincome black women preexisting mistreatment of women of color within reproductive healthcare will only be exacerbated if issue 1 does not pass therefore this board urges you to vote yes on issue 1 we cannot allow ohio to jeopardize our reproductive rights it is important to note that the issue 1 on next weeks ballot is different from the issue 1 that was voted on in august which if passed would have caused constitutional amendments to be passed by a 60 percent vote instead of majority rule issue 2 is the marijuana legalization initiative if passed adults 21 and older would be allowed to buy recreational marijuana although medical marijuana has been legal in ohio since 2016 this board believes that recreational marijuana should be decriminalized much like abortion the criminalization and stigmatization of marijuana still predominantly affects people of color polls are showing that ohioans are in favor of this constitutional amendment according to a poll by the coalition to regulate marijuana like alcohol out of 843 likely voters 55 percent were in favor finally issue 20 would act to redistrict lorain county if passed districts will be created in lorain county and four more county commissioners will be added this proposal is controversial and people across party lines have spoken out against it the increase in county commissioners would mean that power is diluted among elected officials voters would not be able to vote on the elected county executive who would instead be entirely voted on by the board additionally the sevendistrict map is also problematic as it places oberlin a suburban town within district 2 this district encompasses most of southern lorain county which predominantly consists of rural towns this is not equitable demographically and oberlins vote would not be adequately represented in future elections in lorain county in other words its gerrymandering we urge readers to vote no on issue 20 it goes without saying that we have a significant impact on the town as oberlin students it was particularly encouraging to watch students from the reproductive justice alliance and other organizations phone banking and canvassing against issue 1 in the august election even while the majority of students were not on campus during the summer even after one of the strictest voting id requirements in the country was passed in march ohioans overwhelmingly voted no although this is not a midterm or a presidential election the rest of the country is watching what voters in this state have to say because these changes are necessary and an inevitable sign of progress our vote can make a difference that stretches far beyond our campus educate yourself on local and statewide issues and if you havent already filled out an absentee ballot

contributedcredit contributedideas  voicesby peggy lehnernov 5 2023xthere is perhaps no issue as complicated or divisive as abortion although this issue has divided our nation our state and sometimes even households the fact is broad majorities do agree on a few basic tenets according to an nprpbsmarist poll two thirds of americans believe abortion should be legal in the first trimester but support for abortion drops dramatically later in pregnancy with less than one quarter believing lateterm abortion after viability should be legal broad majorities also believe that parents have a right to be notified if their minor child is seeking an abortion and support requiring doctors to inform patients of potential risks associated with abortion before performing the procedurethis november ohioans will vote on issue 1 and for months both sides have based their arguments often on hypothetical outcomes or unrelated issues rather than focusing on the actual impacts the fact is based on a plain reading of the proposed amendment existing ohio law and decades of supreme court precedent we dont need to speculate on the impact if passed issue 1 will enshrine in our constitution one of the most extreme and permissive abortion laws in our nation  allowing many provisions that are not supported by a broad majority of ohioansexplorevoices i support issue 1 because of my faith not in spite of itfor example issue 1 states that even after the point of viability when less than a quarter of americans believe abortion should be legal a doctor can perform a lateterm abortion if the doctor says it is necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or health this last bit is critical the supreme court has already defined health in this context as all factors  physical emotional psychological familial and the womans age this broad definition does not just protect those rare and tragic situations that sometimes occur late in a pregnancy it would permit a doctor to simply say the pregnancy is affecting a womans health and abortion would be legal for all nine months of pregnancy moms ask yourself what pregnancy does not affect your physical emotional or psychological healthohios current restrictions on abortion after 22 weeks were put in place by the legislature after two babies in the miami valley were born alive during the abortion procedure if issue 1 passes even viable infants will be unprotected once again while some may argue lateterm abortions arent very frequent for nonmedical issues consider the words of a local abortionist in an issue of the american medical news describing how 80 of the over 1000 partialbirth abortions he had performed in the 2024 week range were for purely elective reasonsexplorevoices ohio voters deserve facts on issue 1issue 1 would also invalidate ohios parental consent laws the measure states that every individual regardless of their age has a right to an abortion and would prohibit any burden on exercising that right that would mean ohio parents would no longer have the right to know their daughter was seeking an abortion why is this so important complications from abortion can and do occur a minor may experience symptoms of infection that go untreated until it is too late imagine how long it might take a 14yearold to tell her parents that she thinks she might be having medical issues following an abortion they knew nothing about issue 1 will put minor children at risk and keep parents in the darkohios laws on informed consent would likely be struck down as well meaning doctors would no longer be able to tell women about the medical facts and health risks associated with the abortion procedure currently doctors are required to meet with a patient 24 hours before a scheduled abortion to explain the procedure and its health risks this is information a woman needs to make an informed decision for years women reported they were told by clinics that their unborn baby was just a clump of cells and abortion was simply removing those cells but this is not true by 10 weeks all organ systems are present her heart has started to beat and she may even begin sucking her thumb all that is needed is time to grow a woman deserves to know this before she has an abortionexplorevoices pregnancy resource centers offer ohio women a compassionate alternative to abortionabortion is a complex and intensely personal issue reasonable wellmeaning people can come to different conclusions on the states role in protecting both women and the unborn in ohio were known for our commonsense and mainstream values but issue 1 is not the ohio i know issue 1 would put ohio on the extreme end of abortion laws ignoring the desires of the vast majority who want to see commonsense compromise solutions to complex problems for these reasons i urge my fellow ohioans to vote no on issue 1peggy lehner is the mayor of kettering and a former state senatorin other news1voices a hindu perspective

journal editorial board  akron beacon journaltheres no more deeply personal and difficult decision a woman can make than choosing to terminate a pregnancyits a choice motivated by personal and family circumstances often influenced by the realities of poverty sexism and health concerns that can overwhelm anyone facing the responsibility of bringing a new human life into the worldwe respect those who oppose abortion and view life as beginning at conception but we struggle with our government  especially one predominantly run by men  telling women what they can and cant do with their bodiesthats the dilemma facing ohioans with issue 1 appearing on nov 7 ballotswith a yes vote the constitutional amendment would enshrine reproductive rights including abortion into the states constitution essentially returning ohio to the same legal environment in place before roe v wade was overturned in 2022we understand why many people see issue 1 as a good alternative to the highly restrictive law republicans passed banning nearly all abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected at about six weeks a time when many women dont know they are pregnant the ban does not even allow for abortions in cases of rape or incestwere not endorsing or opposing issue 1 choosing instead to provide an analysis of the issue while addressing regrettable claims made by opponentswhat happens if issue 1 failswithout issue 1 the socalled heartbeat abortion law could again govern abortions in ohio although it remains on hold by a judges late 2022 rulingthe conservative ohio supreme court recently heard arguments on that case and could eventually reimpose the ban physicians could face prison lawsuits and loss of their medical licenses for any violationsvoter guide heres our guide to the 2023 election in summit county and ohiotheres also a chance ohio lawmakers could revise the law and address legitimate concerns doctors voiced during the 82 days it was in effect a proactive move suggested by gov mike dewine whether conservative lawmakers would agree is questionablewe know abortions dropped significantly during those 82 days and ohio doctors only oversaw 1967 cases including just 20 patients treated after cardiac activity was detected under an exception for medical emergencieswe also know many ohioans sought care in other states with less restrictive laws including a 10yearold rape victimwhat happens if issue 1 passesthe proposed 211word amendment is simple and straightforwardit gives ohioans the right to make their own reproductive decisions including contraception fertility treatment continuing ones own pregnancy miscarriage treatment and abortion it prevents the state from interfering in those decisions except by using the least restrictive means until a fetus becomes viable outside the wombviability is defined as the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures a lateterm exception remains to protect the womans life or healthissue 1 restores the status quo in ohio and possibly loosens some restrictions lawmakers have imposed including a 24hour waiting period it also adds protections for other reproductive decisions mentioned by the us supreme court last year in its reversal of roe v wadeparental consent wont changethe simple language of issue 1 has left it open to claims ohio could not even enforce current parental consent laws for minors to receive an abortionits highly unlikely that any judge let alone the ohio supreme court would support a legal challenge to parental consent for abortion under the least restrictive means wording of issue 1 nor do we believe any reputable doctor licensed in this state would perform an abortion without parental consent except in clear cases of abuse by a parentdespite what many abortion opponents fervently push medical professionals involved in abortions are not social deviants seeking as many cases as possiblewith issue 1 ohio could still maintain reasonable sciencebased regulations as it does for all medical care the language also does not in any way cover sex changes or gender issues as some claimlateterm abortions will be rareopponents argue issue 1 will allow abortions up to the day before birth thats a gross misrepresentation of the amendment which would only allow lateterm abortions if doctors determined the mothers health was at riskbased on the data mentioned earlier only 20 abortions were performed after six weeks during nearly three months some surely occurred between six weeks and fetal viability meaning a very small number took place anywhere near 40 weeksno woman should ever have to choose between her life and her unborn childs politicizing a rare situation does not help our political discourseread issue 1 and votethe actual wording of issue 1 wont appear on your ballot due to a questionable move by republicans on the ohio ballot board surprisingly supported by the ohio supreme courtyou can read the amendment with this editorialmost importantly please vote your conscience on this important matter we need as many ohioans as possible to weigh in on this decisionits past time for the people of

committee gathered in a downtown columbus ballroom friday morning ahead of the pledge of the allegiance one committee member urged her fellows not to pause before under god the members dutifully took her advice some even adlibbed born and unborn at the end party chairman alex triantafilou joked we take orders very well and voiced hopes it might be a harbinger of things to come the impromptu inclusion of abortion policy in the pledge of allegiance certainly foreshadowed the days debate as for members falling in line though it didnt quite work out that way born and unborn the first significant issue party members considered was a resolution in opposition to a reproductive rights amendment the proposal could appear on novembers ballot gloria martin argued we have to fight this ballot initiative tooth and nail and opposing the measure would be the most important decision of our term its our duty she said to take a stand as republicans as godfearing americans as decent people who say no to a constitutional amendment that will protect abortionists melanie leneghan took aim at ohio house republicans including speaker jason stephens who have dragged their feet on advancing a ballot issue requiring a 60 supermajority for future constitutional amendments the proposal which lawmakers initially tried to get on mays primary ballot is seen by supporters as a way to hurt the abortion rights amendments chances by imposing a higher threshold for passage we needed to get that on the ballot she argued we had 22 republicans who the republican voters of this state elected to do the work of the republican party and promote our policies who instead chose behind closed to partner with democrats lie to the rest of their caucus and kill the bill the resolution passed unanimously 60 percent later that afternoon the committee took up a resolution imploring lawmakers to get the supermajority measure on the ballot and to pass another bill establishing an august special election supporters want to ensure the supermajority proposal gets a vote in august before the abortion amendment goes to voters otherwise theyd get no benefit from the higher threshold the plans sponsors initially argued the effort had nothing to do with abortion any pretense to that effect is gone the snag is lawmakers got rid of august elections just a few months ago so theyd first need to pass legislation restoring them and the clock is ticking the deadline to get something on an august ballot is may 10 i think its absolutely pathetic that we are standing here five days before the deadline barbara holwadel complained she argued they wouldnt be in such dire straits if not for speaker stephens and his republican supporters the 22 who voted with the democrats she described which in my opinion is unforgivable leneghan called those reluctant republicans the blue 22 even though this body voted to censure them they basically flipped us off and said were gonna continue on this road of hellfire setting this party back 40 years and we dont care what you say or what you do were killing this bill the resolution directs lawmakers to approve the senate legislation which is only waiting on a house floor vote the emphasis on sjr 2 came at the recommendation of the measures sponsor david glass represents the central committee district that covers speaker stephens house district regardless of the outcome he argued stephens must hold a vote if we dont have the votes lets see which legislators are against this motion he said judges get the morning headlines delivered to your

that mayor bibb is advocating for issue 1 which if it passes will legalize painful lateterm abortion up to the very moment of birthafrican americans account for only about 14 percent of ohios population but have over 40 percent of the abortions in ohio it is dismaying that mayor bibb does not see this tragic reality and only wants to make painful lateterm abortion legal in our state issue 1 goes too far for all ohioans whether you are a democrat or republican prochoice or prolife it will eliminate a parents right to know if their underage child is considering an abortion and remove health and safety safeguards issue 1 is too extreme for our state and it is a failure of leadership for mayor bibb to support this dangerous amendment close modal suggest a correction submit δ suggest

proposed constitutional amendment was defeated both sides of the aisle said it is time to shift focus to the november election which will have another hotbutton issue on the ballot  abortion if ohioans value the ability to control and make healthcare decisions about their body with their families and their doctors i urge them to pay attention to this ballot initiative thats coming in november rep casey weinstein dhudson said ohioans will be asked whether abortion should be legal to the point of fetal viability and whether reproductive rights and choice should appear in the states constitution this is going to go beyond what most ohioans are willing to accept rep adam bird rnew richmond said we are a prolife state and we want to protect the unborn these are lives and we want to protect them and it is sad to see our fellow man who is celebrating the ability to terminate the life of someone who is preborn but weinstein said he believes there is broad bipartisan support for codifying abortion rights in the state constitution i think every republicans focus is going to be on campaigning back home against constitutionalizing the right to abortion bird said and we have to

signatures to put an amendment on the november ballot to enshrine abortion rights in the states constitution i hereby certify that petitioners submitted 495938 total valid signatures on behalf of the proposed statewide initiative larose wrote in a letter to petitioners clearing the hurdle of roughly 414000 signatures required to be placed on the ballot this fall the proposed amendment in ohio would ensure every individual has a right to make and carry out ones reproductive decisions the statewide vote would come a year after two of ohios neighboring states  deepred kentucky and the political battleground of michigan  supported abortion rights in their own ballot measures after the announcement ohio democratic party chair elizabeth walters called it an important victory for ohio women outoftouch politicians are relentlessly attacking womens fundamental rights inserting themselves into womens personal medical decisions and laying the groundwork for a total abortion ban in ohio in the days and weeks ahead we look forward to telling these corrupt politicians we wont go back walters said in statement ahead of the november election ohio voters face another key vote an august 8 special election set by the republicancontrolled legislature in which voters will decide whether to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution from the current simple majority to 60 opponents of such a special election include abortion rights activists and two of ohios former republican governors bob taft and john kasich who all point out the session is set to happen during a slow summer season where turnout is expected to be low taft at a forum in dayton last month called it a major mistake adding this is a kind of change that really needs to be considered by all the people who go out and vote in a presidential election ohioans united for reproductive rights which collected the signatures and submitted the petition said in a statement tuesday that sponsors of the august special election have admitted it was placed on the ballot for one reason to silence the voices of the vast majority of ohioans who support reproductive rights and abortion access while the vote on the abortion amendment plays out the procedure in ohio remains legal up to 22 weeks into a pregnancy after a cincinnati judge last year temporarily blocked a fetal heartbeat bill that would have banned most abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy that ban was a trigger law passed in 2019 which took effect when the us supreme court struck down roe v wade with its decision last year in dobbs v jackson womens health organization every person deserves respect dignity and the right to make reproductive health care decisions including those related to their own pregnancy miscarriage care and abortion free from government interference lauren blauvelt and lauren beene executive committee board members for ohioans united for reproductive rights said in the organizations statement now that the petition drive is complete were eager to continue the campaign to enshrine those rights in ohios constitution and ensure that ohioans will never again be subject to draconian reproductive health care policies imposed by extremists they added with the petition recognized larose will send it to the ohio ballot board where language on the amendment will be drafted for its inclusion on the november general election ballot according to ohioans united for reproductive rights  who in the meantime said they will actively participate in the effort to defeat the measure up

amendment ballot board summary for voters with one tweak by ohio capital journal staff ohio capital journal september 20 2023 the ohio supreme court has ordered one tweak to summary language approved by republicans on the ohio ballot board for voters to see in november on a proposed reproductive rights amendment the split state supreme court rejected using the full text of the proposed amendment and declared that that summary language that voters will see on their ballots is not misleading that summary language was written by the office of ohio secretary of state frank larose a republican ballot board member who has spoken out against novembers issue 1 reproductive rights amendment proposal and campaigned vigorously for augusts issue 1 proposal to make amendments harder to pass saying that the aug 8 effort was 100 about keeping a radical proabortion amendment out of our constitution issue 1 in august was rejected by voters 57 to 43 larose said at the aug 24 ballot board meeting that he worked extensively on drafting this november ballot language fellow ohio ballot board member republican state sen theresa gavarone explicitly spoke against the november amendment proposal during that same ballot board meeting where the summary language for voters to see on their ballots was approved by the board in a 32 decision the coalition proposing novembers reproductive rights amendment sued to the ohio supreme court claiming that the summary language is deceptive and asking the full amendment text be used instead they argued that the summary makes changes advocates say alter the language in a biased way such as using unborn child rather than the medically accurate term fetus and changing pregnant patient to pregnant woman the summary also only lists 1 of 5 protected rights included in the amendment focusing on abortion and failing to mention contraception miscarriage care fertility treatment and continuing ones pregnancy moreover the abortion rights groups and individuals said the summary actually inverts protections that would be given in the amendment by saying the amendment would always allow an unborn child to be aborted if a physician determines it necessary amendment supporters say the actual language of the amendment would prohibit such an abortion if the patient objects to it finally the complaint took issue with the summary language saying citizens of the state of ohio would be prohibited from enacting laws regulating abortion in certain ways instead of the state of ohio would be so prohibited the ohio supreme court ruled tuesday that this last part is the only tweak the ballot board must make  they can not use the citizens of the state of ohio instead of the state of ohio proposed amendment b the state shall not directly or indirectly burden penalize prohibit interfere with or discriminate against either 1 an individuals voluntary exercise of this right or 2 a person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right unless the state demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the pregnant individuals health in accordance with widely accepted and evidencebased standards of care c as used in this section  2 state includes any governmental entity and any political subdivision the ohio ballot boards language that needs changed to remove citizens the proposed amendment would  prohibit the citizens of the state of ohio from directly or indirectly burdening penalizing or prohibiting abortion before an unborn child is determined to be viable unless the state demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means  only allow the citizens of the state of ohio to prohibit an abortion after an unborn child is determined by a pregnant womans treating physician to be viable and only if the physician does not consider the abortion necessary to protect the pregnant womans life or health the ohio supreme court wrote they were tasked with determining whether the gop summary language is impermissibly argumentative either in favor of or against the issue regarding the ballot board summarys failure to mention 4 of 5 categories included in the reproductive rights amendment proposal the republican court majority cited the amendments own emphasis on abortion care and said the omission is not material when considering the amendment as a whole regarding the ohio ballot board changing fetus to unborn child in the summary for voters the majority said this is not improper persuasion they did not elucidate an argument but instead quoted precedent from a 2021 court decision f ballot language is factually accurate and addresses a subject that is in the proposed amendment itself it should not be deemed argumentative the court majority referenced this again later in rejecting that other portions of the summary language are weighted against the proposal proposed amendment a every individual has a right to make and carry out ones own reproductive decisions including but not limited to decisions on  3 continuing ones own pregnancy b the state shall not directly or indirectly burden penalize prohibit interfere with or discriminate against either 1 an individuals voluntary exercise of this right however abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability but in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patients treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or health ballot language the proposed amendment would  prohibit the citizens of the state of ohio from directly or indirectly burdening penalizing or prohibiting abortion before an unborn child is determined to be viable unless the state demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means  only allow the citizens of the state of ohio to prohibit an abortion after an unborn child is determined by a pregnant womans treating physician to be viable and only if the physician does not consider the abortion necessary to protect the pregnant womans life or health and  always allow an unborn child to be aborted at any stage of the pregnancy regardless of viability if in the treating physicians determination the abortion is necessary to protect the pregnant womans life or health the court majority wrote while litigants do not like the way in which the language is phrased the structure of statements is not improperly argumentative as stated above this court will not deem language to be argumentative when it is accurate and addresses a subject in the proposed amendment ohio supreme court democrats agreed with ordering the change from citizens of the state to the state but panned the approval of the rest of the ballot boards language justice jennifer brunner a democrat said the ohio ballot board obfuscated the actual language of the proposed amendment by substituting their own language and creating out of whole cloth a veil of deceit and bias in their desire to impose their views on ohio voters democratic justice melody stewart said that the ohio ballot board failed its duty and instead it crafted partisan ballot language designed to do any number of things but not simply designed to do its jobthat is inform voters of the substance of the proposed amendment democratic justice michael donnelly said of the ohio ballot board that its unfortunate that advocacy seems to have infiltrated a process that is meant to be objective and neutral but that hes confident that voters will be informed about the issue in november get the morning headlines delivered to your

friday issued a ruling in the latest lawsuit against the proposed abortion amendment on states november ballot denying the challenge from antiabortion activists who were attempting to keep the proposed amendment off the ballotthe lawsuit originally filed july 28 claimed the proposed amendment did not meet state requirements it specifically referenced a requirement that initiative petitions make reference to any existing statute or constitutional provision that would be amended or repealed if the proposed law or constitutional amendment is adoptedattorney curt hartman filed the complaint on behalf of former state rep thomas e brinkman jr and exlegislative candidate jennifer giroux both republicans from cincinnatiwe simply called upon the court to apply wellestablished legal principles including most significantly to give effect to the law as written not to rewrite the law or to legislate from the bench hartman said on fridayexplorelawsuit seeks to remove proposed abortion amendment from november ballotthe ohio supreme court consists of four republican justices and three democrats six of the seven justices concurred with the challenge being denied and justice patrick f fischer concurred in judgement only the majority opinion discusses the interpretation of the ohio revised code the lawsuit is referencing saying the petition of a proposed constitutional amendment would only have to make reference to the text of any existing constitutional provision not any existing statute proposed laws not proposed constitutional amendments would have to reference existing statutesthe courts conclusion says it denies the challenge because the ohio revised code does not require a petition proposing a constitutional amendment to include the text of an existing statutefischer filed his own opinion which concurred in judgement only saying he also did not agree with the lawsuits reading of ohio revised code fischers reasoning focused on the idea that a constitutional amendment could repeal an existing statute by implicationin addition to citing four specific existing statutes girouxs brief also says the proposed amendment would create conflicts with innumerable existing statutes which fischer points to as another way the girouxs claims dont workexploreohio amendment ensuring access to abortion certified for november ballotif giroux cannot confidently say that relators have identified all the statutes that would be in conflict with the proposed constitutional provision wouldbe proponents of constitutional amendments will not be able to either fischer says giroux has not shown that the proposed constitutional amendment would amend or repeal any existing statutehartman criticized the courts ruling and described the proposed amendment as having a radical scopedisappointedly as a result of the courts decision the proponents of the proposed constitutional amendment will continue to be able to hide from the public the radical scope of a proposal that will outright eliminate existing laws on a broad range of matters including eliminating parental rights while suddenly elevating the role of strangers in all aspects of our childrens lives and sexual development hartman saidthis week organizers behind the proposed amendment said they were not worried about this latest court challengewe knew that this was forthcoming that antiabortion extremists in the state were really going to throw everything they could at us said dr sri thakkilapati of ohioans united for reproductive rights that case against us its pretty absurd and it expects us to have done something that is actually impossible and has no legal precedent said dr lauren beene of ohioans united for reproductive rights we dont actually see it as a significant threat its more of a distraction waste of time and moneyantiabortion groups are decrying the courts ruling with the group created equal saying it plans to run a robust ad campaign against this proposed amendment on the november ballottoday the ohio supreme court cleared the way for an extreme abortion amendment to go on the ballot in november said mark harrington president of created equal the socalled right to

both sides of the issue 1 fight who have now pledged to come out of the ballot measures defeat and move on to the abortion referendum in november both unsurprisingly expect to come out ahead whether its reproductive rights voting rights or labor rights these freedoms should not be subject to the whims of outoftouch politicians us rep emilia sykes dohio said in a tuesday night statement as issue 1 headed for defeat tonight we celebrate but the fight continues in november the unofficial tally showed a resounding rejection of the legislatureproposed amendment to raise the voter threshold to change the ohio constitution from 50  1 to 60 as of wednesday morning with all precincts reporting and more than 35 million votes entered 57 of voters cast a no vote on the issue with 43 of voters on the yes side according to the ohio secretary of states office 58073 absentee and provisional ballots have yet to be counted but the rejection of issue 1 holds an insurmountable 430000 vote lead the ohio christian alliance mentioned this vote deficit in its statement after issue 1 was defeated saying opponents of the measure again used 28 days of early voting to bank the vote against the issue and that margin was just too great to overcome despite early voting leaning democratic since the pandemic ohio voters of any party can vote early if they so choose the defeat of issue 1 means the status quo continues in ohio with no changes to the requirements to approve a constitutional amendment and signature campaign requirements of 44 of 88 counties in the state remaining as they were before the ballot measure the failure of issue 1 allows an equal playing field for future proposed constitutional amendments including the upcoming vote on reproductive freedom in november columbusbased policy organization innovation ohio said in a statement but the group also used celebration of the win to begin reminding voters of the next election nov 7 for which the voter registration deadline is in just two months if it wasnt already apparent abortion rights will be the bigmoney issue for voters with a citizeninitiated constitutional amendment headed for ballots this time around antiabortion groups expressed their disappointment over the issue 1 loss but pushed forth with plans to campaign against what they see as an apocalyptic change to the state constitution the national antiabortion group created equal which often protests using graphic photos to claim the impacts of abortion said they plan everything from television ads to campus outreach and even airborne billboards and overpass outreach above major highways to push their campaign views according to the groups leader mark harrington one of the biggest groups in favor of issue 1 because of the impact it would have on passing the abortion amendment in november  making it more difficult  was protect women ohio a coalition of antiabortion groups the group said the defeat of issue 1 actually proved why the constitution should have been changed pointing to liberal dark money groups and other unnamed entities as culprits of an eleventh hour push against the measure our prolife proparent coalition is more motivated than ever the group said in a statement the group along with other antiabortion rights groups pushed forth with debunked statements theyve made that the november amendment proposal would legalize all lateterm abortion and impact parental rights including the right for parents to make decisions when it comes to genderaffirming care parental rights and genderaffirming care do not appear in the language of the proposed constitutional amendment which was approved by the ohio ballot board in march the ohio supreme court stood by the boards decision after the board was sued by opponents of the measure the lawsuit claimed the board which is led by ohio secretary of state frank larose had abused its power in certifying the language proabortion rights groups such as ohioans united for reproductive rights said the rejection of issue 1 proved a different point that support for abortion rights is a driver for ohioans at the polls ohioans believe that abortion is a personal private decision that should be up to them and their families without government meddling in their business ourr spokesperson rhiannon carnes said in a statement in a fundraising email one of ourrs partner groups prochoice ohio called the issue 1 effort illconceived and the grassroots effort to reject it while still working toward passage of the november abortion amendment a path forward for ohio these extremists had hoped that ohio voters would not be paying attention during their busy summers wrote kellie copeland prochoice ohio executive director in the email but ohioans are paying attention and will not give up their rights to powerhungry legislators not between summer camps or vacations and not ever us sen sherrod brown dohio said he plans to make reproductive rights including the abortion amendment a priority as his own 2024 reelection campaign ramps up and as the november election comes around its still going to be a hard race because opponents are going to lie about the ballot issue and theyre going to spend millions of dollars to do it brown said on a wednesday press call he said hes confident the issue will pass in november even saying he is expecting almost everybody that voted no last night will vote yes in november its clear that the mainstream view in this society is that  abortion rights should be protected just like civil rights should be protected and labor rights should be protected brown said get the morning headlines delivered to your inbox subscribe support news you trust donate ohio capital journal is part of states newsroom a network of

pregnancy to those after 12 weeks of pregnancy ap photochris sewardapsubscribers can gift articles to anyoneby andrew j tobias clevelandcomcolumbus ohio  the fight over a proposed abortion amendment on the november ballot will be waged in pews and at pulpits across ohio but despite a common public perception of how federal tax laws limit political activity by churches and other charities the catholic church and other religious organizations that advocate for and against a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution shouldnt face any legal jeopardy according to legal expertsthe catholic church in ohio is gearing up for this novembers election in a manner that in some ways resembles a political action committee its preparing to distribute literature to parishioners deploy church leaders to highdollar political fundraisers make direct campaign contributions totaling in at least the hundreds of thousands of dollars and even have its priests preach from the pulpit in opposition to a ballot measure that would add legal protections for abortion to the state constitutionin light of these moves brian hickey executive director of the catholic conference of ohio the churchs official state advocacy arm said hes heard from people who believe that churches and other religious organizations arent allowed to wade into politics under federal law that allows them to accept taxfree donationsbut thats not the case hickey saidthe law is very clear we can speak to ballot issues and the underlying issues themselves hickey said and for catholics who disagree with the churchs position on abortion and protections for life were happy to talk about it and why the church teaches what it doesin interviews experts in election and tax law confirmed that under a 1954 taxcode provision known as the johnson amendment churches are barred from endorsing political candidates as part of their taxexempt statusreligious leaders sometimes skirt the edges of those limitations black faith leaders long have been a key constituency for democratic politicians while white evangelical pastors are a core part of the american political right religious backers of donald trump in 2016 got the thencandidate to promise to revoke the johnson amendment named for lyndon b johnson the former legislator and president although he didnt do so and it remains on the books todaybut the provisions rules generally dont apply to issues including campaigns for ballot issues tax law views politicking surrounding things like the proposed abortion amendment as more akin to lobbyingits a misnomer to think that churches dont have a voice in politics said atiba ellis a law professor at case western reserve university its that churches cannot advocate for or against candidates for public officei understand why the rules are confusing when it comes to ballot measures said beth kingsley a washington dcbased attorney who specializes in nonprofit tax law its on the ballot the advocacy around that is regulated by the states campaign finance laws and so it feels like the same thing as endorsing a candidate but from an irs perspective its considered lobbying and that is allowed for charitiesthe catholic churchs role in the fight over abortionthe ohio catholic conference opposes state issue 1 the newlynamed ballot measure that would add legal protections for abortion to ohios constitutionthe proposed amendment would generally guarantee that patients could make their own reproductive decisions including birth control fertility treatment continuing a pregnancy or abortion and miscarriage care up until viability which is around 22 to 24 weeksafter that point the state could regulate abortion however abortions after that cutoff could be permitted if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patients treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or healthohioans united for reproductive rights the campaign backing issue 1 also counts religious groups among its backers including the greater cincinnati board of rabbis and the united church of christthe national setting of the united church of christ believes in freedom said the rev traci blackmon ucc associate general minister for justice and local church ministries we understand this belief to be guided by scripture and supported by the resolutions of the church reproductive freedom is not an exception to the faith the reproductive decisions of persons and families are theirs to make and should not be legislated by those who are elected to uphold and protect the freedoms of all citizensbut the catholic church plays a more integral part in the antiabortion movement including helping bankroll tv ads and offering other support thats more akin to a political action committeelast year the catholic church in michigan gave at least 6 million to an unsuccessful campaign to defeat a similar abortion measure there around a quarter of the funds the no campaign collected in ohio state campaign finance records show that dioceses across the state gave 900000 to protect women ohio the official antiissue 1 political campaign group the church also is helping raise money for the effort with cleveland bishop edward malesic appearing alongside republican gov mike dewine at a clevelandarea fundraiserhickey said church officials clearly understand restrictions the law places on religious groups when it comes to political issues the church doesnt get involved in backing political candidates he said but priests and other leaders commonly talk about the issues that are important to the church and which often cut across party lineswere going to talk about the churchs teaching generally with talking about life and the importance of caring for those most vulnerable in society such as the immigrant the refugee the poor the homeless and of course preborn children hickey saidhow the irs polices church advocacyeven when it comes to issues federal tax law does theoretically place limits on political advocacy by religious organizations kingsley saidthe amount religious groups spend on lobbying still must represent an insubstantial amount of the organizations overall budget a number that attorneys generally advise translates to around 5 of an organizations expendituresbut kingsley said that religious organizations are difficult for the irs to track since they are not required to file 990s the annual tax returns that most charitable organizations file detailing their financial activities to the irs and the publicplus the irs is reluctant to audit churches generally because of the potential for public backlash unless the organization itself appears to be fraudulentits at the bottom of list of things that they want to deal with kingsley said they will investigate churches that look like shams that are the church of me and my spouse and were going to claim a tax deduction for our house but they really dont want to get in the middle of a fight about churches and politics because if they do if nothing else they know a lot of politicians are going to come to the defense of a church and attack the irs as doing something improper even if they are following the rulesthey dont have any interest in taking on the catholic church kingsley said in shortluis garcia a spokesperson for the irs declined to comment for this story garcia did point however to a 2015 irs publication that offers guidance to churches and religious organizationsunder privacy and nondisclosure law it is against the law for me or any irs employee to comment on or discuss a taxpayers or tax entitys tax information or relationship with the irs garcia said in an emailmixing religion and politicsthere have been times in the past when the irs has revoked the taxexempt status of bona fide churches in 2000 branch ministries lost its status after a church affiliate in new york ran a series of newspaper ads urging christians to not vote for bill clinton in the 1992 presidential election citing the thenarkansas governors views on abortion and homosexualitybut generally ellis said the irs walks a balancing act when it comes to enforcing the law individual clerics he said may break the law during services but particularly when it happens in smaller independent churches it may never land on the irss radari think there are first amendment issues involved in this kind of regulation ellis said if the irs gets perceived as going out to quash religious liberty by overzealously dealing with the political prohibition i dont think the irs or any part of the government was to be viewed that waymark caleb smith a political scientist at cedarville university a private baptist school in the dayton area said american churches long have gotten involved with politics including more recently operating within or around the tax lawsthis can involve toeing the line like inviting a political candidate to speak to a congregation and heavily implying that congregants should support them or offering church space to political groups for organizing purposesbut on a more basic level smith said churches are a basic political unit giving members opportunities to learn to organize and communicate in order to persuade and engage with the broader public through their teachings on moral issues churches also influence their congregants worldviews in a way that easily translates to politics he saidsmith said that recently though churches have gotten more directly involved in politics particularly on the political righti think to some degree since our country has broken into this culture war dynamic  religion is inherently engaged in those kinds of questions having to do with good and evil human sexuality marriage male female abortion those are at some level a religious question and it seems like religious organizations are getting pulled more and more into these conversations since theyre so fundamental to our politics smith saidsmith said he used to think there would be a serious risk for churches to wade into controversial political and social issues because of the potential to divide congregants but hes changed his views in recent years as churches increasingly have become more ideologically uniform as society has become more politically divided and congregants have sorted themselves to live among likeminded peoplethere certainly are people who are offended by it but in my experience those people dont make up enough of most congregations to really steer or create risk for the pastor or priest

ap the outcome of the contest means that for abortion rights to be protected in the state constitution the proposed amendment on the ballot in november will need to secure the backing from a simple majority of ohio voters who go to the polls in the general election the proposed amendment the final language of which will be drafted by the ohio ballot board provides that every individual has the right to make their own reproductive decisions including on contraception and abortion the measure also prohibits the state from interfering with that right but allows abortion to be prohibited after fetal viability generally around 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancyohio law currently bars abortion after 22 weeks though the state has on the books a ban on the procedure after embryonic cardiac activity is detected generally around six weeks gestation and often before a woman knows she is pregnant which went into effect after the supreme court overturned roe v wade the sixweek law though was blocked by a state court while a legal challenge moves forwarda july poll from usa today and suffolk university found that 58 of likely voters back the abortion rights amendment a measure of support

cardiac defects are associated with the highest neonatal morbidity and mortality among all congenital heart malformations and carry a high burden of health care resource utilization from the time of diagnosis through staged surgical palliation323 neonates with singleventricle cardiac defects are at risk of longterm morbidity including heart failure neurologic injury multisystem organ failure and early death37 they require complex surgical intervention at a specialized center prolonged neonatal hospitalization staged surgical palliation in early childhood and a high lifelong burden of surgical interventions323 although longterm survival is possible with surgical intervention ranging between 70 and 90 it is associated with high rates of major morbidity and mortality including the need for multiple staged heart surgeries heart transplant extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ecmo and intensive care unit level care372023 as states continue to impose abortion restrictions at various gestational ages we anticipate an increased incidence of neonates born with singleventricle cardiac defects and other lifelimiting anomalies12427 we selected the cohort of neonates with singleventricle cardiac defects because of the high risk for longterm morbidity and need for intervention to achieve postnatal survival given the significant resource utilization required for the care of such neonates we sought to investigate the implications of potential national abortion ban scenarios on the incidence of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects and associated resources needs methods a decision tree model was developed to predict the incidence of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects and related outcomes in the united states under four theoretical national abortion bans 1 abortion restrictions in existence immediately before the june 2022 dobbs supreme court decision 2 a ban at 20 weeks of gestation 3 a ban at 13 weeks of gestation and 4 a complete abortion ban defined as no abortion access federally134844 three theoretical abortion bans were selected based on multiple proposed legislative bans and available literature demonstrating incidence of abortion within these specific gestational ages1226273435 since the dobbs decision and as of april 2023 12 total bans on abortion and one ban on abortion at 6 weeks of gestation are in effect in addition to several restrictions resulting in essentially inaccessible abortions in 15 states and 26 states expecting to ban abortion1 the current landscape on abortion in the united states includes 43 states prohibit abortions after a specified gestational age 16 states had a neartotal abortion ban in effect at some point in 20221 the model followed the typical course of pregnancy and modeled a general obstetric population in the united states considering both prenatal and postnatal diagnosis of singleventricle cardiac defects4549 for the purpose of our study singleventricle cardiac defects is broadly defined as cardiac defects in which biventricular circulation is not possible and as a result surgical singleventricle palliation is indicated411 the structure of the model is demonstrated in figure 1 neonatal outcomes included incidence of singleventricle cardiac defects in live births neonatal heart surgery and transplant ecmo and neonatal death we selected the outcomes heart surgery heart transplant and ecmo because they are resourceintensive interventions and because a substantial portion of neonates requiring these interventions survive beyond the neonatal period323 we selected neonatal death as an outcome to determine the incidence of neonatal death among those born with singleventricle cardiac defects in different abortion ban scenarios341113162023 this study used simulated data and thus was exempt from irb approvalfig 1 decision model for estimating the effect of universal abortion ban scenarios on neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by neonatal singleventricle congenital heart disease svcd ecmo extracorporeal membrane oxygenationa decision tree was designed based on current clinical pathways and known probabilities all model inputs and different algorithm decision point probabilities were aggregated from the existing literature table 134844 two authors hem ah conducted a thorough search of medical literature in pubmed using keyword and mesh term searches for the concepts singleventricle cardiac defects heart surgery heart transplant ecmo neonatal death pregnancy rate abortion rate abstracts were reviewed for relevance populationbased registry data were prioritized followed by multicenter reports and subsequent single center reports studies outside the united states were considered when data from the united states were not availabletable 1 model inputsour theoretical cohort consisted of 6369000 patients based on the approximate number of annual pregnancies in the united states per year in the 2021 national vital statistics data2829 these pregnancies resulted in 3664292 recorded live births29 the initial decision node was whether the pregnant patient continued with pregnancy underwent an abortion or underwent spontaneous abortion less than 13 weeks of gestation we used national data on incidence of firsttrimester abortions before the june 2022 dobbs decision23435 the subsequent decision node was whether those continuing pregnancy after the first trimester underwent secondtrimester abortion or experienced secondtrimester spontaneous abortion between 13 and 19 weeks of gestation we selected this gestational age range as to exclude stillbirths defined as pregnancy loss after 20 weeks of gestation from this cohort and based on available national abortion data3440 the key subsequent decision node was whether the patient received a diagnosis of fetal singleventricle cardiac defects at the routine fetal anatomy ultrasonogram or other indicated imaging performed at approximately the same gestational age 20 weeks of gestation on average911 we selected this decision node based on the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists and the american institute of ultrasound in medicine recommendation for a fetal anatomy ultrasonogram occurring after 18 weeks of gestation4546 based on recent data between 60 and 85 of cases of singleventricle cardiac defects are detected prenatally at the time of the fetal anatomy ultrasonogram or subsequent imaging after suspicion of a congenital cardiac defect91150 although some structural cardiac disease can be detected in highlyskilled centers in the first trimester or suspected by an increased nuchal translucency for the purpose of this analysis we excluded those rare cases with a firsttrimester diagnosis30 among fetuses with and without a prenatal diagnosis of scvd after the fetal anatomy ultrasonogram we used probabilities of live birth abortion or stillbirth4044 then among liveborn neonates without a prenatal diagnosis we calculated and used the probability of a postnatal diagnosis of singleventricle cardiac defects ranging between 10 and 28 of neonates101214 together the prenatal and postnatal diagnoses constituted the total incidence of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects the following decision nodes were the selected neonatal outcomes to assess the resource utilization of a live neonate with the diagnosis of singleventricle cardiac defects under various potential abortion ban scenarios monte carlo simulations using the decision tree model were performed for the four different scenarios for the probability at each node the triangular distribution was applied the base probability was set to be the median value of the lower range and upper range of probabilities the purpose of the predobbs policy simulation was to validate the model by comparing known national data on neonatal singleventricle cardiac defect outcomes we conducted 10000 iterations of each simulation model to estimate median values for each outcome the 25th and 75th percentiles were also calculated to characterize uncertainty around the median we then replicated the simulation approach among 100000 live births per year to more accurately understand the effects based on statewide population data statistical analyses and simulations were performed using r httpswwwrprojectorg results in our theoretical model we estimated 6369000 annual pregnancies in the united states based on the approximate number of annual pregnancies in the united states per year according to the 2021 national vital statistics2829 based on the model inputs in table 1 we predicted that under the predobbs abortion legislation there would be 1006 annual cases of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects which would affect the current health care system by requiring approximately 986 annual neonatal heart surgeries 28 heart transplants and 142 ecmo utilizations with 189 neonatal deaths table 2 appendix 1 available online at httpslinkslwwcomaogd286 our predicted number of annual cases is similar to the centers for disease prevention and control estimate of approximately 1025 neonates with singleventricle cardiac defects born annually14table 2 predicted incidence of neonatal single ventricle cardiac defects and associated outcomes per year in the united states under four abortion ban scenariosin the scenario of a complete abortion ban the model predicted a 537 increase in the diagnosis of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects or an additional 9 cases per 100000 live births this increase would result in an additional 531 neonatal heart surgeries 16 heart transplants 77 ecmo utilizations and 102 neonatal deaths annually table 2 appendix 1 httpslinkslwwcomaogd286 this assumes an overall predicted annual livebirth rate of 1547 neonates with singleventricle cardiac defects which would then lead to an overall need for 1517 heart surgeries 44 heart transplants and 219 ecmo utilizations as well as 291 neonatal deaths table 2 appendix 1 httpslinkslwwcomaogd286 two additional abortion scenarios including an abortion ban at 13 weeks of gestation and a ban at 20 weeks of gestation were also analyzed table 2 appendix 1 httpslinkslwwcomaogd286 in the scenario of an abortion ban at 13 weeks of gestation live births would increase to 1385 resulting in 1357 heart surgeries 40 heart transplants 196 ecmo utilizations and 261 neonatal deaths in the abortion ban scenario at 20 weeks of gestation the model predicted 1361 live births with a total of 1333 heart surgeries 39 heart transplants 142 ecmo utilizations and 189 neonatal deaths in our model of neonatal outcomes per 100000 live births when compared with the predobbs policy a complete abortion ban would lead to 35 cases per 100000 live births per year table 3 this increase is equivalent to an extra 35 heart surgeries one heart transplant five ecmo utilizations and seven neonatal deaths per 100000 live births annually table 3 gestational agebased bans at 13 weeks 20 weeks or after 20 weeks would confer similar increases in rates of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects and related adverse outcomestable 3 predicted incidence of neonatal single ventricle cardiac defects and associated outcomes per 100000 live births per year in the united states under four abortion ban scenariosdiscussion in a theoretical datadriven simulation of the effects of varying abortion bans on neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects our model predicted an increase in the number of neonates born with singleventricle cardiac defects and thus an increase in the number of neonates requiring heart surgeries heart transplants and ecmo and in neonatal deaths substantially affecting health care systems these data should be used in conjunction with existing registrybased data to inform policies surrounding abortion care for individuals with highrisk pregnancies neonates with singleventricle cardiac defects have a high risk for longterm morbidity and need for intervention to achieve postnatal survival of up to 7090323 although most centers now use staged surgical repair as an initial approach for uncomplicated singleventricle cardiac defects heart transplantation continues to be used in cases of singleventricle cardiac defects complicated by comorbidities that limit the efficacy of surgical palliation413171951 the number of neonatal heart transplants performed per year has remained stable approximately 100 procedure per year with singleventricle cardiac defects contributing to a substantial proportion of these procedures5152 limited appropriate heart donors restricts the availability of this lifesaving therapy for many neonates53 our model assumes that the increased need for heart transplant will be matched by donor availability but this would not necessarily be the case neonatal heart transplant wait list mortality would likely increase substantially51 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an essential modality to support neonates with complex congenital cardiac disease particularly those with singleventricle cardiac defects unresponsive to medical therapy15 the goal of ecmo is to support the neonates heart during a bridge to longterm support heart transplantation or alternative therapies18 even those who survive ecmo remain at risk of ongoing health problems unplanned cardiac interventions unplanned rehospitalization neurodevelopmental problems language acquisition delays behavioral problems and diminished quality of life1518 use of ecmo requires highlevel neonatal intensive care unit support and with a preexisting national shortage of neonatal intensive care unit physicians and nurses there is a concern for an inability to provide support to an increasing population among those with singleventricle cardiac defects5354 there are far reaching implications for staffing of hospitals and hiring ecmosupport teams currently the recommended paradigm for fetal assessment by most national and international societies includes an initial firsttrimester ultrasonogram between 11 and 13 weeks of gestation followed by a fetal anatomy screen after 18 weeks of gestation4549 antiabortion legislation has been introduced to create a federal ban on abortions after 15 weeks of gestation1 the implications of this ban mirrors our results for a theoretical abortion ban beyond 20 weeks of gestation based on the assumption that fetal anomalies will not be detected at most centers between 14 and 18 weeks of gestation a universal 15week ban would likely prompt the need for earlier detailed fetal anatomy imaging although most cardiac anomalies are not detected in the first trimester even in experienced centers3031 in efforts to prepare for varying abortion bans clinicians providing prenatal care should use standardized anatomical protocols to attempt to improve the sensitivity of firsttrimester ultrasonography to increase detection rates of fetal anomalies3031 this likely would translate into an increase cost to the health care system due to earlier and more extensive diagnostic testing our study has several strengths including the utilization of patientlevel data into estimates of probability and model inputs we used recent literature to predict probabilities for the model and were able to analyze different proposed gestational age limit abortion bans we incorporated predicted loss rates in the first and second trimesters and analyzed the most severe neonatal outcomes among survivors that said our study is not without limitations our model did not include cases of singleventricle cardiac defects that may be diagnosed in the first trimester either directly or indirectly by genetic testing or ultrasound screening the selected theoretical abortion ban gestational age scenarios may not reflect all current abortion legislation and we acknowledge that state legislation is variable1 we selected a broad diagnosis of singleventricle cardiac defects based on available literature on perinatal outcomes8 our findings are not applicable universally to all neonates who are not surgical or biventricular candidates and there is variability in outcomes based on the specific singleventricle anatomy3 we also limited our analyses to include neonatal outcomes however much of the effects on our societys health care resources would occur across a lifetime and this was beyond the scope of our study in summary universal abortion bans will significantly increase the incidence of neonatal singleventricle cardiac defects associated morbidity and resource utilization given that 34 of all pregnancies are complicated by structural birth defects there are additional lifelimiting fetal anomalies that would likely contribute to increased health care resource utilization in the setting of abortion bans including severe neurologic anomalies other cardiac defects abdominal wall defects lung lesions and genetic syndromes2426 abortion legislation is rapidly changing however the incidence of fetal anomalies has remained stagnant as restrictions are being enacted the potential effects of these anomalies on health care resources should guide policy makers1265556 states considering limiting abortion access should consider the implications of such policies on the resources required to care for the increasing number of children that will be born with significant and complex medical needs including congenital heart diseasereferences 1guttmacher institute an overview of abortion laws accessed on

offer voters a chance to read views from both sides on the abortion amendmentsubscribers can gift articles to anyoneby editorial board clevelandcom and the plain dealerin recognition of the strong personal passions stirred for so many ohioans by the abortion question generally and by issue 1 on the nov 7 ballot specifically our editorial board decided not to issue a conventional endorsement instead we asked members of our editorial board to write short essays summarizing their thinking and emotions on the issue and to take individual stances on issue 1 if they so chose the idea was to give readers a varied template for how to think about the issue and to help sensitize all of us to the range of views on the matter participation was voluntary so not all members of our editorial board decided to write essays but those who did put both heart and mind toward the effort and this wasnt an exercise in polemics our editorial board members wrote their essays as personal statements not in response to what other editorial board members wrotefor those who want to read the wording of the actual amendment we also include that at the end in the meantime here is what members of our editorial board have to saya matter of equity and womens bodily autonomy in explaining my support of issue 1 i could rattle off the common prochoice argument  that women can never achieve gender equality or their full potential as individuals if they are denied full reproductive freedom and the right to an abortion but beyond that core feminist principle are more nuanced arguments about autonomy the imposition of ones religious beliefs upon another the role government should play in our lives and the insidiousness of oppressionthe worlds religions hold divergent views on when a fetus receives a soul or attains fully human status if your religion guides you to believe that life begins at conception the good news is that this constitutional amendment protects your right to make a choice about your own pregnancy in alignment with that belief but just as you might fiercely defend your right to your value system consider that imposing it on the choices of millions of others who might believe differently is wholly unamericanfundamentally it is the governments responsibility to ensure that women have access to reproductive health services and that the children they birth join a society that supports them with health care stable housing and highquality education but while ohios conservative lawmakers argue on moral grounds that thousands of unplanned pregnancies should continue to term those same lawmakers abandon children entirely once they are born into poverty and need supportcome to think of it there really isnt a more effective way for the most privileged and powerful among us to widen the inequities that preserve their status than by stripping women of bodily autonomy  forcing thousands of them to continue pregnancies that bind their potential or deepen their familys poverty antichoice laws are tools of social oppression masquerading as moralityfor all these reasons im voting yes on issue 1  leila atassi manager public interest and advocacyleila atassi is the managing producer for the public interest and advocacy team at the plain dealer and clevelandcom and a member of the editorial boardissue 1 goes well beyond the choice most ohioans support as much as prolife forces in this state might deplore the idea theres one reality they are going to have to acknowledge ohio voters will pass either a constitutional amendment or a law guaranteeing some form of abortion rights sometimethat is without question polls are not infallible but its clear that the bulk of ohioans favor a reasonable avenue for women to access safe and affordable abortion procedures to end unwanted pregnanciesthe problem and the calamity that awaits us next month if voters who occupy the middle ground on the abortion question dont pay attention is that the abortion rights amendment on the nov 7 ballot is not in the least reasonablethe current postroe heartbeat law in ohio banning abortions before most women even know they are pregnant is too strict for most people but issue 1 expands legalized abortion far beyond anything weve seenit specifically bans the state from considering the life of the unborn child the only restrictions allowed are to advance the pregnant womans health in accordance with widely accepted and evidencebased standards of care  whatever that meansand while it allows the state to restrict abortions after viability it leaves the viability determination completely in the hands of the attending physician it gives the physician the latitude to end a pregnancy at any time he or she believes its necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or health which could include mental health with no need for consultation that erases any guardrails whatsoeverthat is the message reasonable people need to hear  not the easily refuted hysterical fearmongering that it will allow children to get gendertransition surgeries without parental consentvoters need to read the proposed amendment and understand the openended provisions it includes the result will be tragic if they dont ted diadiun columnistted diadiun is a columnist for the plain dealer and clevelandcom and a member of its editorial boardon abortion moral and religious beliefs are paramount how anyone votes on issue 1  to guarantee access to abortion in ohio  is her or his business i judge no one and i believe a womans possible decision to end a pregnancy is likely the most difficult that she could ever facebut as a catholic i also believe what my church teaches in its catechism that human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception whats more from the first moment of his existence a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person  among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to lifeand francis a pope more open to the worldasitreallyis than any of his predecessors has repeatedly said abortion is morally unacceptablemany ohioans personally oppose abortion but support a womans right to choose it after all liberty is our countrys apex value being opposed to abortion in the abstract however sincerely but without actually limiting it is ineffectualagain i judge no one i believe that ohioans on both sides of issue 1 will cast their votes based on their sincerely held beliefs which are to be respected my sincerely held beliefs informed by my churchs teachings will lead me to vote no on issue 1  thomas suddes editorial writer and columnistthomas suddes is an editorial writer and columnist for the plain dealer and clevelandcom who also serves on the editorial boardour religions should guide us but not to dictate other deeply personal decisions i understand and respect those who believe that life begins at conception and abortion amounts to murder this belief is generally rooted in their faith and trying to talk someone out of their faith is an exercise in futility as we all know religion is a deeply personal matter so personal in fact that societal norms tell us not to discuss it in public however those who have such deeply personal beliefs should also recognize that the decision to bear a child is an equally deeply personal decision it is a personal sacrifice that is literally borne aloneit seems inconsistent to me that to honor the deeply personal beliefs of some prolife advocates women are not granted the autonomy to take a deeply personal matter into their own hands it seems unreasonable to me to demand that a woman bear a child against her will simply because a group of people claim that their faith demands that she do so we vilify countries in other parts of the world with oppressive laws derived from their interpretations of islamic faith yet we see no hypocrisy in oppressing women based on our interpretations of christian faith if it is wrong when they do it it should still be wrong when we do itvote yes on issue 1 not because you support women having abortions or not but because you believe that religion should not be used to make women secondclass citizens with less autonomy to make their own choices than men  eric foster columnisteric foster is a columnist and a community member of the editorial board for the plain dealer and clevelandcomwe have work to do on respecting the sanctity of life but freedom remains paramount report after report continues to show that children in this state especially urban children of color continue to rank low on qualityoflife indicators we also rank at the bottom 10 on certain key measures of wellbeing for children who age out of the foster care system see the childrens defense funds measuring transformation  elevating youth voice in child welfare how can we as ohioans say that believe in the sanctity of life when we make it hard for so many lets be honest this whole debate is about control and what is at stake here is our fundamental right to make decisions about our minds and bodies without that right then how free are we truly america is not a theocracy or authoritarian state so then why do we have in place laws and policies that limit our freedoms issue 1 is democracy in action let the people decide what is best for themselves not elected officials who push their personal values this is not about democrats or republicans its about americans coming together to uphold our freedoms vote yes on issue 1  victor ruiz editorial board membervictor a ruiz is executive director of esperanza inc and a community member of the plain dealer and clevelandcom editorial boardissue 1 goes too far commonsense ohioans should reject issue 1 its far too extreme issue 1 advances progressive ideology that denies womens existence threatens parental rights and legalizes abortion without limits worse these radical values would be enshrined in our state constitutionallegedly reproductive rights are womens rights but issue 1 never mentions women is this a nod to the absurd notion that men can become pregnant regardless lets be clear an amendment that denies womens existence wont protect themin asserting every individuals right to reproductive decisions issue 1 also threatens parental rights proponents say that parental consent rights arent easily abrogated but no one knows how courts will interpret every individual especially if ohioans knowingly approve an amendment without age restrictionsohio doesnt give minors unfettered access to alcohol and tobacco the same should be true for abortion if reproductive rights were extended to minors children experiencing gender dysphoria could potentially access hormones and surgeries without parental consent activists disdain parents who wont follow progressive genderaffirming care protocols they would surely use issue 1 to sideline parents but parents not radicals know whats best for their childrenproponents argue that transgender care decisions arent reproductive decisions but issue 1s including but not limited to clause allows for additional unspecified decisions moreover how are decisions around reproductive hormones and organs not reproductive decisions again the courts will decidefinally issue 1 would effectively legalize abortion throughout pregnancy nullifying any state laws limiting abortion fullterm babies in utero could be sacrificed in defense of womens right to choosethus issue 1 is a radical amendment that would shackle our state constitution with progressive ideology that denies womens existence threatens parental rights and legalizes killing preborn childrenfor ohioans who understand whats at stake the decision on issue 1 is easy vote no  mary cay doherty editorial board membermary cay doherty is a community member of the plain dealer and clevelandcom editorial boardwhen the personal intersects with the law set aside the fearmongering about issue 1 because the scare tactics are a smokescreen to mask the harsh reality that without issue 1 ohioans face a dark future of increasingly punitive big brother laws from a legislature dominated by men seeking to prevent the states citizens particularly its women from exercising control over their bodies and reproductive optionsissue 1 by contrast will enshrine abortion rights in the ohio constitution overriding a legislature living in the dark agesis this personal for me you bet i remember the days before roe when women with means flew to mexico while those without used clothes hangers or backalley means that  contrary to assertions from abortion foes  left a record of pain infertility and death that was never fully documentedis this personal for my family you bet when my first pregnancy ended after three months with a dead fetus in my womb i was able to get a hospital dilation and curettage procedure no questions asked with all fetal tissue removed allowing me to conceive again within a few months that resulted in the birth of our beloved sonin practice the d  c procedure was outlawed in preroe days resulting in horrifying stories of women forced to carry their dead fetus until the body bloodily expelled the tissue at some future time including in their workplaces lavatory and if not all the fetal tissue was expelled that way it was possible that womans ability to conceive again would be impacted a pediatric surgeon recently informed meso yes issue 1 is personal for me it should be personal for everyone who cares about the primacy of individual rights over religiously motivated government mandates  elizabeth sullivan opinion directorelizabeth sullivan is the director of opinion and also directs the editorial board for the plain dealer and clevelandcomtext of issue 1s proposed constitutional amendment be it resolved by the people of the state of ohio that article i of the ohio constitution is amended to add the following sectionarticle i section 22 the right to reproductive freedom with protections for health and safetya every individual has a right to make and carry out ones own reproductive decisions including but not limited to decisions on 1 contraception 2 fertility treatment 3 continuing ones own pregnancy 4 miscarriage care and 5 abortionb the state shall not directly or indirectly burden penalize prohibit interfere with or discriminate against either 1 an individuals voluntary exercise of this right or 2 a person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right unless the state demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individuals health in accordance with widely accepted and evidencebased standards of care however abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability but in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patients treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patients life or healthc as used in this section 1 fetal viability means the point in a pregnancy when in the professional judgment of the pregnant patients treating physician the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures this is determined on a casebycase basis 2 state includes any governmental entity and any political subdivisiond this section is selfexecutinghave

house of representatives minority leader allison russo addresses attendees at the washington county democrats picnic sunday evening photo by kristen hainkel a state level representative stopped by a washington county democrats picnic sunday evening to discuss the value of election turnout and issue 1 a reproductive rights protections amendment ohio house of representatives minority leader allison russo said the organization was doing a good job in bringing out voters for local elections there are a lot of places and communities across the state i think you all have demonstrated especially here in marietta that youve been able to hold on to the local city council in a majority is phenomenal russo said she believed personal conversations can change minds but recognized the difficulty of weeding through misinformation i recognize that its hard especially in this environment of misinformation that we have right now and fighting back against some really alarming different sets of facts or nonfacts she said russo said one of the most valuable lessons shes learned as a politician is finding common ground with constituents we share the same values we may disagree on how to get to the outcome that were trying to get to but at the end of the day we all care about the same things it doesnt matter what your party affiliation is we care about opportunities for our families and our children we care about our neighborhoods and our communities we care about freedom she said russo said democrats dont always turn out to vote in non presidential elections there are no offyear elections unfortunately as democrats sometimes were not so good at showing up in the odd year elections or in the midterm elections we only show up for presidential elections weve got to stop doing that theres too much at stake she said russo also addressed issue 1 the right to make reproductive decisions including abortion initiative which would add reproductive rights protection to ohios constitution if passed this initiative will be on the state ballot nov 7 overwhelmingly we know that ohioans all across the political spectrum this is not purely a democrat or republican issue do not support the extreme abortion bans that weve seen out of this state legislature they support the rights of individuals to make their own personal and private health care decisions i believe we will see a record turnout which in turn i think will be helpful for our local elections she said russo said individuals should educate their neighbors about issue 1 now is the time to have those conversations with your neighbors and your family members and say hey do you know this is on the ballot first of all do you know this is on the ballot also make sure they are not confused that we want you to vote yes instead of no she said russo said the deadline for registering to vote for november is october 10 early voting starts october 11 newsletter todays breaking news and more in your inbox im

enough we can vote to restore our freedoms by voting yes on issue 1make no mistake if we fail to pass issue 1 this november abortion will be banned in ohio republicans have already passed a law that outlaws abortions before most women even know theyre pregnant with no exceptions for rape or incest we have already seen the awful impacts from women with lifethreatening complications denied care to sexual assault survivors and cancer patients forced to leave the state to receive an abortion it will only get worse extremist members of the state legislature have openly discussed going even further and banning birth controlwe have a chance to stop all this by voting yes on issue 1 this amendment will guarantee that ohioans have access to abortion contraception and miscarriage care it puts women and their families not politicians back in charge of these personal decisionsopponents of issue 1 are working hard to divide us and distract us with outright lies time and time again independent fact checkers have debunked their false claims issue 1 will not change the rules around abortions later in pregnancy which are extremely rare it will not change parental consent laws and it has nothing to

in the buckeye state will weigh in on issue 1 next week ahead of the vote a coalition of progressive and reproductive rights organizations are working tirelessly to protect abortion rights and access if approved the measure will block the states dangerous sixweek abortion ban passed by the gopled state legislature and currently blocked by the courts on tuesday the voters can put peoplenot politiciansback in charge of their own decisions about their bodies and families as we witness the devastating fallout of extremist republicans abortion bans in the wake of the supreme courts decision in dobbs v jackson womens health organization these opportunities to win back our rights are as important as ever polls show that 8 in 10 americans believe in legal abortion and we know that given the chance voters overwhelmingly vote to protect their freedoms at the ballot box but that hasnt changed what were up against in state after state voters must overcome dirty tricks and dishonest politicians who simply cheat when confronted with the reality that the public doesnt support their dangerous antiabortion agenda there is perhaps no better example than ohio where republican frank

in his attempts to trick and silence voters we need your help to stay independent subscribe today to support salons progressive journalism in august ohioans rejected his thinlyveiled power grab designed to make all future citizenled amendments more difficult to pass for weeks gop politicians outofstep with the majority of ohioans lied about the amendments true intentions until larose said the quiet part out loud acknowledging that it was 100 about blocking abortion rights weeks later ohioans overwhelmingly rejected his amendment by 14 points yet columbus politicians only dug their heels in further weeks after his failure larose used his official position to rewrite the language ohioans will see when they vote on issue 1 this november and cram in antiabortion disinformation meant to muddy the waters it is yet another blatant attempt to silence and trick voters and block an effort that more than 700000 ohioans signed on to support but larose much like his colleagues across the republican party does not care what his constituents want he doesnt care about their health and wellbeing after all he has already promised to support a national abortion ban if elected to the senate regardless of how ohioans vote this november at reproductive freedom for all weve been in this fight for over 54 years and we know there will always be politicians like frank larose who are more concerned with getting ahead than doing the right thing for the people they were elected to represent but we have hope because voters have shown time and again that they will not sit back and take extremists efforts to roll back their most fundamental rights last year voters showed the country that a consensus of americans believe everybody should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their lives and futures they went to bat for abortion rights and access securing victories for reproductive freedom in every state where it was on the ballot  including red states now voters have a chance to do it again in ohio theres still a long road ahead to make sure every person in our country can access the abortion care they need its a fight that will take every tool in our

april 5 2023 since the overturn of roe v wade last summer abortion access in ohio has been hanging in the balance after the supreme court decision a 6 week ban on abortion went into immediate effect throughout the state the ban is currently on hold by an ohio judge and prochoice groups are working to protect abortion access in the state once and for all the protect choice ohio coalition has filed paperwork for a ballot initiative on abortion for the november 2023 elections the activists will need to collect more than 400000 signatures from a minimum of 44 counties in order to qualify to be on the ballot the measure would establish a fundamental right to reproductive freedom with reasonable limits in the ohio state constitution and would require restrictions imposed past a fetus viability outside the womb to be based on evidence of patient health and safety benefits the prochoice coalition is composed of organizations such as ohio physicians for reproductive rights oprr planned parenthood and the aclu the feminist majority has partnered with oprr to assist in the signature collection oprr has organized more than 2200 physicians and medical professionals to fight to guarantee that ohioans have access to safe legal and equitable reproductive medical care including abortion dr lauren beene the executive director has said that the ballot measure will preserve the doctorpatient relationship and empower all people to make their own reproductive health care decisions without interference from the government lobbyists and politicians this strategy of advocating for a ballot initiative to protect abortion rights has proven successful in many other states in 2022 kansas shocked the country by overwhelmingly voting to reject an antichoice ballot measure using this momentum activists in california kentucky michigan montana and vermont secured abortion protections for their states in the midterm elections as well the feminist majority is confident that ohio

donate signal cleveland asked jessie hill a professor and associate dean at case western reserve universitys school of law to weigh in on what this new amendment means for ohioans and whether it could be challenged again by state legislators this interview was edited for brevity can the proposed amendment or the election be challenged in court if so can the implementation of the amendment be delayed hill the only way the amendment could be challenged is if it were found to violate federal law a constitutional amendment is superior to regular state laws there is no way to argue that the amendment is contrary to some ohio statute or regulation professor jessie hill specializes in reproductive rights credit courtesy of case western reserve university if there had been a question about the validity of the election results there is a possibility that the implementation could have been delayed  though the 30day effective date is written in the ohio constitution so its not certain even that would delay implementation but given the decisive margin for issue 1 this is also very unlikely some republican legislators are already talking about limiting the scope of the amendment apparently through new legislation what are their options hill if legislators want to change the amendment they actually have to do that through another constitutional amendment not regular legislation this means they would have to draft the new amendment and then put it on the ballot again and it would have to pass with a majority vote unless they want to raise the threshold to 60 now ha ha if republicans win both chambers of congress and the white house next year and pass a national abortion ban would that supersede the rights now embedded in ohios constitution hill yes that is the only other way the amendment could be undermined because federal law is supreme over state law  including state constitutions  a federal abortion ban would trump even ohios constitutional amendment would a national abortion ban be unconstitutional in light of the us supreme courts overturning of roe v wade and returning legal authority over abortion to the states hill not necessarily in dobbs  the supreme court said that the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution does not provide any protection for abortion rights but it did not speak to what congress can or cannot do the court only said that states can decide because there is no federal constitutional protection for abortion rights that would prevent states from passing laws restricting abortion that said there may be other arguments  not based on dobbs but based on the us constitution  that a federal abortion ban is unconstitutional such as that congress lacks the authority to pass such a law if a federal ban is passed and then challenged the us supreme court will ultimately decide the issue do you have questions related to issue 1 email them to franksignalclevelandorg news for people not for profit signal

sean hannity told viewers on tuesday that some antiabortion measures espoused by republicans are not in line with the views of most americans on tuesday night voters in ohio elected to enshrine the right to an abortion in the states constitution after the republican legislature and governor imposed a sixweek ban which was subsequently blocked by a court last year in the meantime prochoice activists managed to land the issue on this years ballot as of this writing 556 of ohio voters opted to add reproductive rights to their constitution the provision states that abortion may be banned after fetal viability or around the 23rd week of pregnancy however conservatives argue the language is so broad as to render that benchmark meaningless if were really gonna honest about this  and i consider myself prolife but i understand thats not where the country is  i would say first trimester 15 weeks seems to be where the country is hannity said and these issues will be decided by the states he went on to say that abortion law will not be decided in congress but at the state level the fox news host previously warned that some of the antiabortion measures being enacted around the country are out of step with where most people are in august republicans in ohio tried to raise the threshold for amending the constitution via referendum from a simple majority to 60 that measure failed prompting hannity to offer a warning i believe in the sanctity of life but i think politically that there is republicans have gotta say as bill clinton once said  i never thought id quote him

voters deserve facts on issue 1ideas  voicesby anita somaninov 5 2023xfor 50 years under the federal roe v wade decision women and their families had the right to make their own personal reproductive decisions including abortion unfortunately ohio lawmakers have been chipping away at this right by increasing restrictions on abortionas a practicing obgyn for 30 years ive had a frontrow seat to the harm those restrictions have caused while it may be more difficult to access abortion services its also more difficult to access regular preventative care  birth control cancer screenings and other important reproductive health care servicesin june 2022 the us supreme court overturned roe v wade within hours ohio implemented one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation for 11 weeks women in need of reproductive care  abortions yes but also treatment for miscarriages postpartum hemorrhage and other pregnancy complications  were denied careexplorevoices issue 1 will enshrine in our constitution one of the most extreme abortion laws in our nationissue 1 is a constitutional amendment to ensure women have access to the full spectrum of reproductive care including abortion issue 1s opponents have been waging an egregious campaign of misinformation riddled with lies and scare tactics its my duty as a physician and as a public servant to combat these lies and provide ohio voters with facts surrounding reproductive carethe inconvenient truth that issue 1 opponents dont discuss extreme abortion laws increase maternal and infant mortality study after study bears this out rapid physical changes caused by pregnancy can aggravate existing health conditions or trigger new ones potentially leading to life threatening complications the cdc found that 754 mothers died during pregnancy in 2019 and another 850 in 2020 many more suffered serious complications that required lifesaving interventionissue 1 leaves the determination of fetal viability up to doctors because no two pregnancies are alike fetal development can be impacted by factors such as the health of the mother and the quality of the health care the fetus has had access to remember abortion bans decrease the availability of all reproductive care determinations of viability require medical training and shouldnt be made by the governmentexplorevoices pregnancy resource centers offer ohio women a compassionate alternative to abortionopponents of issue 1 often raise the specter of lateterm abortion the truth is that is not a medical term or procedure in medical practice the need to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability is accomplished by inducing delivery not only is this extremely rare but when it does occur lifesaving measures are provided to that vulnerable infant in 2021 in ohio less than 2 of all abortions occurred after 19 weeks and only 1 after 21 weeks in all the life or health of the mother was threatened unfortunately most deliveries prior to 23 weeks die within the first month but make no mistake those premature infants receive all available lifesaving measuresissue 1 does not impact parental consent laws legal experts across the state agree parents have a federal constitutional right to care for and control the actions of their children and no ohio law  not even a constitutional amendment  can take that away consent for minors would still be required to have an abortion or any other medical procedureexplorevoices i support issue 1 because of my faith not in spite of itextreme abortion law also weakens the quality of our health care system a recent analysis by the association of american medical colleges found that new doctors applying for residency programs avoid states with the strictest abortion laws doctors often live where they train fewer doctors coming to ohio could ultimately lead to maternal care deserts throughout our statethe issue of abortion has become political but it shouldnt be because it is part of reproductive care dont be fooled by the lies a yes vote on issue 1 assures the families of ohio that they can continue to get the full spectrum of reproductive care including ivf contraception and abortion it also assures that obgyns like me can continue to provide the best care possible without fear of criminal penalty dont let the government interfere with the doctor patient relationship vote yes on issue 1anita somani md

organization that generally operates behind the scenes of state politics has experienced a rare public controversy over its internal operationsthe episode surrounds the departure of its nowformer communications director and comes ahead of a november election that will be pivotal for the future of abortion in ohio it also shows a fundamental tension the antiabortion movement is confronting in todays politics in which it must package a political argument  that abortion is an unequivocal wrong that should be banned  to an increasingly skeptical public that has repeatedly voted for abortion to be legal when given the chancelast week ohio right to life parted ways with lizzie marbach who had served as the groups communications director since march 2022 the reason comes down to what could be described as strategic differences ahead of the november vote on abortion rights and marbachs prolific use of social mediaortl leaders took issue with marbachs tone on twitter including an aug 10 post in which she called an abortionrights backer a murderous liar other recent posts included one from aug 12 that described an iconic image of the virgin mary in a mexican catholic church as idolatry  the catholic church is a key ally in the effort to defeat the november abortionrights amendment  and one sharing an aug 10 post that said people who support abortion rights shouldnt be allowed in the medical professionin a message to clevelandcom and the plain dealer marbach said her former bosses generally just had problems with me using bolder terms to describe abortion like murder or evil they preferred softer tonessuch a personnel move typically wouldnt attract broader attention but it occurred around the same time marbach was the subject of a brief viral twitter controversy following an exchange with a local republican congressman rep max miller of rocky river some media outlets mostly rightleaning ones linked the two events together suggesting that marbach got fired for being an outspoken christianmiller who is jewish responded to a tweet last week from marbach in which she declared theres no hope for any of us outside of having faith in jesus christ alone miller called the post bigoted and told marbach to delete it which she refused to doin true social media form the exchange quickly drew in a wide range of national commenters including jenna ellis a former campaign lawyer for expresident donald trumps campaign and rep ilhan omar a minnesota democrat who is one of the few muslim members of congress marbachs instate defenders included ohio republican politicians and operativesmiller a public defender of judaism apologized later in the evening saying his post had conveyed something he hadnt intendedaround the same time marbach lost her job an internal email obtained by clevelandcom and the plain dealer show that before the exchange with miller ohio right to life was in the process of parting ways with marbach including interviewing a potential replacement ohio right to life pointed out this general timeline in a press release on monday in which they announced that their board had voted to back marbachs right to religious expression while also emphasizing that marbach has said publicly her departure was unrelated to the exchange with millerin a spate of postfiring publicity including podcast interviews opeds and sympathetic articles from rightleaning outlets marbach has portrayed herself as the victim of an antiabortion movement cowed by censorious progressive antichristian forces in societyother political groups within ohios antiabortion movement have come to marbachs defense including the ohio christian alliance which plans to interview marbach this week on its podcast and the ohio legislative prayer caucus a group of socially conservative religious republican lawmakerswe are more offended and embarrassed by calling abortion murder than we actually are about abortion being murder marbach told the sentinel a recently launched rightleaning online outlet it is complete lunacy and i pray that this situation helps to point that outsince her firing marbach has criticized the campaign to defeat the november abortionrights amendment from the sidelines faulting it for not referencing the issue more directly in a column for the blaze a rightleaning outlet marbach criticized the campaigns official name itself protect women ohio which she described as cowardice and an example of being fearful of speaking the truth about abortionpolling meanwhile has suggested that upwards of 59 of ohioans support the november constitutional amendment or at least some form of legal protection for abortion while its full legal impact is unclear the abortion amendment would nullify the states heartbeat law signed by gov mike dewine in january 2019 that bans abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy one of the strictest standards in the country the law temporarily went into effect after the us supreme court overturned roe v wade in june 202 but has been on hold for more than a year due to a legal challengereeling from voters rejection of state issue 1 earlier this month a vote that had major implications for the vote in november some abortion opponents have publicly debated whether the movement needs to adopt more moderate political aims in light of their latest electoral defeatthis helps explain why the campaign to defeat the november amendment has tried to redirect debate over the amendment to pull in nonabortion related issues like tying it to progressive views on gender an argument independent legal experts have described as a stretchand by parting ways with an outspoken offmessage spokesperson while trying to do damage control through an afterthefact press release it

court on friday unanimously voted to throw out a lawsuit from two southwest ohio conservatives seeking to block a proposed abortionrights measure from making the november ballotthe courts decision means that pending any other potential legal roadblocks ohioans will vote on the proposed abortionrights amendment on nov 7the lawsuit filed by former state rep tom brinkman a cincinnati republican and 2022 republican legislative candidate jenn giroux argued that the petition to place the proposed state constitutional amendment was invalid because it didnt mention that state laws would have to be repealed if the measure passes those laws include a sixweek abortion ban that passed in 2019 but is currently on hold pending the resolution of a separate legal battle in the ohio supreme courtgiroux and brinkman pointed to an ohio law stating that a petition shall include the text of any existing statute or constitutional provision that would be amended or repealed if the proposed law or constitutional amendment is adoptedbut in an unsigned ruling the court interpreted the wording of that law to mean that only proposed initiated statutes  voterpassed measures to force legislative consideration or passage of a state law  needed to list existing laws that they would nullify a proposed constitutional amendment follows a similar but different processto illustrate their point the court turned to a foodrelated analogysuppose an invitation states the vegetarian and nonvegetarian meal options are tofu and chicken the ruling stated a reader would intuitively understand that tofu was the vegetarian option and chicken was the nonvegetarian optionnot that either tofu or chicken was a vegetarian option this is the distributivephrasing canon at workthe ruling was joined by three of the four republicans on the court  chief justice sharon kennedy and justices pat dewine and joe detersrepublican justice pat fischer concurred in the judgement but he issued a separate opinion arguing that giroux and brinkman misinterpreted that state law in a different way fischer held that abortionrights activists didnt need to list any laws their proposed amendment would repeal because constitutional amendments by themselves dont repeal lawsthe standard phrasing is that an unconstitutional statute is void fischer wrote giroux errs in assuming that when a law becomes inoperative it also is repealedall three democratic justices  jennifer brunner mike donnelly and melody stewart  concurred with the lead ruling without writing separate opinionsthe courts ruling comes three days

that having worked extensively on drafting this i do believe its fair and accurate larose has been vocal in his opposition of the amendment even saying the effort around the previous issue 1 which would have changed the threshold to approve a constitutional amendment had it not been roundly defeated was targeting the abortion rights fight specifically at the beginning of thursdays meeting he prefaced the boards activity by saying the group was not there to debate the merits of the amendment or the marijuana ballot initiative also on the table at the meeting ohio ballot board member state sen theresa gavarone rbowling green speaks at the ballot board meeting thursday photo by graham stokes for ohio capital journal republish photo only with original article board member and state sen theresa gavarone however gave a speech in the middle of the meeting harshly criticizing the amendment and calling it a bridge too far even after multiple comments by larose about the neutrality with which the board was supposed to conduct their business this is a dangerous amendment that im going to fight tirelessly against gavarone said but thats not why were here today gavarone also claimed as antiabortion groups throughout the state do as well that the amendment is an assault on parental rights neither the amendment nor the summary approved by the board mention parental rights of any kind the senator continued her comments during the board meeting saying the true nature of the amendment is hidden behind overly broad language despite the fact that the board summary took out pieces of the full text the summary passed by the board does not include a list of the rights to reproductive decisions spelled out in the ballot measure including contraception fertility treatment continuing ones own pregnancy and miscarriage care all of which would be impacted under the new constitutional amendment a clause in the proposed amendment that says the state shall not directly or indirectly burden penalize prohibit interfere with or discriminate against the exercise of the amendment by an individual or an assistant of the individual was reduced to the citizens of the state of ohio in the summary the phrase the citizens of the state of ohio is also used in the clause summarizing a prohibition of abortion that would only happen if a pregnant patients physician finds the pregnancy to be viable the phrase pregnant patient in the ballot measure was changed to pregnant woman in the summary ohio ballot board member state sen paula hickshudson dtoledo speaks at the ballot board meeting thursday photo by graham stokes for ohio capital journal republish photo only with original article state sen paula hickshudson the other democratic member of the ballot board made two motions to change the language of the summary to bring back the full text or certain clauses of the actual amendment text into the approved language the full text is clear its concise and its direct which is one of the requirements thats needed for us to present to voters in the state of ohio hickshudson said both motions were rejected 32 with larose gavarone and the final board member bill morgan voting against the motions morgan didnt speak during the meeting other than to register his votes and didnt specifically comment on the amendment discussion or language afterward i think its what we were supposed to do what the ballot board does morgan told the ocj groups for and against the initiative anticipated potential issues with the boards decision with proabortion rights group ohioans united for reproductive rights requesting that the ballot language mirror the amendment itself so voters could see the entire constitutional change when they vote in november lauren blauvelt a member of the coalition decried the changes made to the language and said the group is considering a lawsuit to fight back the entire summary is really propaganda and we are going to talk about all of the reasons why ohio voters should just be able to see the language for what it is blauvelt said after the board meeting antiabortion groups argued against using the full text saying it was unnecessary and ohio right to life president mike gonidakis pushed back on calls for a lawsuit against the summary any litigation filed on this is going to be thrown out by the ohio supreme court because the statutory responsibility of the ballot board is to provide a fair and accurate representation thats what the law requires and thats what they did today gonidakis said gonidakis said he did not work with anyone on the ballot board on the summary language but he wished the language was stronger mike gonidakis president of ohio right to life talks to the press after the ohio ballot board meeting thursday photo by graham stokes for ohio capital journal republish photo only with original article look at the end of the day people are going to make up their minds before they go in the ballot box anyways and theyre not going to go in and then try to figure out what they want to do by reading something on a screen he said the proposed amendment has gone through a rollercoaster of activity since the ohio ballot board approved the measure in march as compliant with the regulations for a constitutional amendment proposal allowing a petition campaign that resulted in nearly 500000 supporting signatures from ohio voters amid all the necessary hoops through which the abortion rights campaign has jumped abortion rights groups have also had to battle against lawsuits attempting to block the amendment from voters another lawsuit alleged the ohio ballot board hadnt taken enough time or consideration before certifying that the amendment was compliant the ohio supreme court rejected both lawsuits
