The outbreak was first reported in the Philippines when a suspected case was confirmed on July 28, 2022, according to the Department of Health.\n\nBackground\n\nHistory\n\nArrival\nThe first case of human mpox in the Philippines was confirmed on July 28, 2022. The case involved a 31-year-old Filipino national who arrived from abroad to the Philippines on July 19, 2022. He also had prior travel to countries with documented mpox cases. The individual's mpox infection was confirmed through a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa which yielded a positive result on July 28, 2022. The patient had already recovered at the time of the health department's announcement but is undergoing isolation at home. Ten other people, including three people from the individual's household were identified as close contacts.\n\nEarlier on July 23, 2022, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the World Health Organization declared the mpox global outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.\n\nOn August 6, 2022, the patient was discharged after undergoing the 21-day quarantine isolation to which no other person was infected according to the Department of Health (DOH). Other close contacts tested negative too though they are still required to complete their 21 days of quarantine.\n\nFurther cases\nOn August 19, 2022, the DOH announced the detection of two more cases; those of a 34-year-old and a 29-year-old both of which has a history of travel abroad. The 34-year-old patient is undergoing home isolation and the 29-year-old patient is in isolation at a health facility. Contract tracing was conducted for both with the latter having 17 identified contacts. The PCR test conducted for both individuals returned positive results on August 18 and 19 respectively.\n\nAll three cases at that time are unrelated to each other as they entered the Philippines from different countries and the DOH considered these cases as \"imported\" cases. They have exhibited typical symptoms associated with mpox like lesions on their faces and other parts of their bodies.\n\nDOH Technical Advisory Group (TAG) member Dr. Edsel Salvana says he expects more cases to be detected but allayed concerns of a local transmission or the disease becoming endemic in the country. He points out that mpox is less contagious than COVID-19 and that protocols in place for the COVID-19 pandemic is also mitigating the spread of mpox.\n\nOn August 22, the DOH announced that the country has detected its fourth case that of a 25-year-old Filipino who have no travel history outside the country. The individual's PCR Test returned a positive result on August 19. The health department also stated that the fourth case is not related to the previous three. The following day the health department's Western Visayas regional office, released further details regarding the patient confined in a hospital; a male who works in Iloilo City and resides in Iloilo province. Iloilo City mayor Jerry Treñas in an interview with local radio stations said that the indicidual worked in a fast food chain in the city and added that he had a relative who recently came in from abroad.\n\nThe DOH also asked the Western Visayas regional office to investigate the photos of the patient shared on social media as early as August 22 deeming such act as an unauthorized disclosure of private and confidential information.\n\nThe second case was deemed recovered on August 31 while the third case was considered the same on September 8. The fourth case was discharged from the hospital on September 15 and is deemed to have recovered.\n\nAftermath\nThe Philippines would not record any further case of the human mpox. In May 2023, the public health emergency of the WHO was declared over. Meanwhile, the country's health department never declared a health emergency.\n\nRelated cases abroad\nOn September 5, 2022, the first ever case of mpox in Hong Kong was detected from a passenger who arrived from a flight from Manila. The individual concerned is a 30-year old Hong Konger.\n\nResponse\n\nOn May 24, 2022, the DOH expressed readiness to detect and contain mpox if it reaches the Philippines. It has classified mpox as a notifiable disease requiring health facilities in the country to report all patients under investigation and cases to its Epidemiology Bureau (EB) and Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit. It also announced that all suspected cases are to undergo reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for mpox.\n\nBy June 20, 2022, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa announced that it has optimized its real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the detection of monkeypox virus.\n\nAs of July 2022, the RITM and the Philippine Genome Center in Quezon City are the only institutions in the Philippines capable of detecting mpox through RT-PCR tests. The DOH has aimed to expand capacity and capability to other institutional hospitals as well. Ninoy Aquino International Airport and several national airports ramped up their surveillance to detect the virus. In an explicit statement on August 2, 2022, DOH Officer in Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said that borders and foreign entry are not to be shut down whilst not yet receiving recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, it was affirmed that the opening of classes and universities will still resume on August 22 accordingly along with the cooperation of DepEd and local LGUs.\n\nThe DOH has also entered negotiations with the United States government in a bid to secure mpox vaccines for a limited demographic. Along with the WHO, the DOH has been proactively monitoring cases and revamping medical facilities in the country.\n\nUpon the detection of the first case, the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines Inc. released a statement advising against home isolation for further suspected mpox cases.\n\nNotes\n\nSee also \n\n COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Department of Health official public health advisory\n\nPhilippines\nMpox\nMpox", "unikey": "2022–2023 mpox outbreak in the Philippines", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "History", "Related_cases_abroad", "Response", "Notes", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["", "### Arrival\nThe first case ofhuman mpoxin thePhilippineswas confirmed on July 28, 2022.

geneva a group of global experts convened by who has agreed on new names for monkeypox virus variants as part of ongoing efforts to align the names of the monkeypox disease virus and variants  or clades  with current best practices the experts agreed to name the clades using roman numerals the monkeypox virus was named upon first discovery in 1958 before current best practices in naming diseases and viruses were adopted similarly for the name of the disease it causes major variants were identified by the geographic regions where they were known to circulate current best practice is that newlyidentified viruses related disease and virus variants should be given names with the aim to avoid causing offense to any cultural social national regional professional or ethnic groups and minimize any negative impact on trade travel tourism or animal welfare disease assigning new names to existing diseases is the responsibility of who under the international classification of diseases

monkeypox virus variantsclades the naming of variants for existing pathogens is normally the result of debate amongst scientists in order to expedite agreement in the context of the current outbreak who convened anad hocmeeting on 8 august to enable virologists and public health experts to reach consensus on new terminology experts in pox virology evolutionary biology and representatives of research institutes from across the globe reviewed the phylogeny and nomenclature of known and new monkeypox virus variants or clades they discussed the characteristics and evolution of monkeypox virus variants their apparent phylogenetic and clinical differences and potential consequences for public health and future virological and evolutionary research the group reached consensus on new nomenclature for the virus clades that is in line with best practices they agreed on how the virus clades should be recorded and classified on genome sequence repository sitesconsensus was reached to now refer to the former congo basin central african clade as clade one i and the former west african clade as clade two ii additionally it was agreed that the clade ii consists of two subclades the proper naming structure will be represented by a roman numeral for the clade and a lowercase alphanumeric character for the subclades thus the new naming convention comprises clade i clade iia and clade iib with the latter referring primarily to the group of variants largely circulating in the 2022 global outbreak the naming of lineages will be as proposed by scientists as the outbreak evolves experts will be reconvened as needed the new names for the clades should go into effect immediately while work continues on the disease and virus names media contacts who media team related 2022

invited to submit suggestions for new names based on these consultations and further discussions with whos directorgeneral dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who recommends the followingadoption of the new synonym mpox in english for the disease mpox will become a preferred term replacing monkeypox after a transition period of one year this serves to mitigate the concerns raised by experts about confusion caused by a name change in the midst of a global outbreak it also gives time to complete the icd update process and to update who publicationsthe synonym mpox will be included in the icd10 online in the coming days it will be a part of the official 2023 release of icd11 which is the current global standard for health data clinical documentation and statistical aggregation the term monkeypox will remain a searchable term in icd to match historic informationconsiderations for the recommendations included rationale scientific appropriateness extent of current usage pronounceability usability in different languages absence of geographical or zoological references and the ease of retrieval of historical scientific informationusually the icd updating process can take up to several years in this case the process was accelerated though following the standard stepsvarious advisory bodies were heard during the consultation process including experts from the medical and scientific and classification and statistics advisory committees which constituted of representatives from government authorities of 45 different countries the issue of the use of the new name in different languages was extensively discussed the preferred term mpox can be used in other languages if additional naming issues arise these will be addressed via the same mechanism translations are usually discussed in formal collaboration with relevant government authorities and the related scientific societies who will adopt the term mpox in its communications and encourages

when around other peopleavoid physical contactthe disease mpox formerly monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus commonly abbreviated as mpxv an enveloped doublestranded dna virus of the orthopoxvirus genus in the poxviridae family which includes variola cowpox vaccinia and other viruses the two genetic clades of the virus are clades i and ii the monkeypox virus was discovered in denmark 1958 in monkeys kept for research and the first reported human case of mpox was a ninemonthold boy in the democratic republic of the congo drc 1970 mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animals to people following eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide mpox steadily emerged in central east and west africa a global outbreak occurred in 20222023 the natural reservoir of the virus is unknown  various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptibletransmissionpersontoperson transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals this includes contact which is facetoface talking or breathingskintoskin touching or vaginalanal sexmouthtomouth kissingmouthtoskin contact oral sex or kissing the skinrespiratory droplets or shortrange aerosols from prolonged close contact the virus then enters the body through broken skin mucosal surfaces e g oral pharyngeal ocular genital anorectal or via the respiratory tract mpox can spread to other members of the household and to sex partners people with multiple sexual partners are at higher riskanimal to human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches or during activities such as hunting skinning trapping cooking playing with carcasses or eating animals the extent of viral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway people can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens through sharps injuries in health care or in community setting such as tattoo parlourssigns and symptoms mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 121 days after exposure symptoms typically last 24 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system common symptoms of mpox arerashfeversore throatheadachemuscle achesback painlow energyswollen lymph nodesfor some people the first symptom of mpox is a rash while others may have different symptoms firstthe rash begins as a flat sore which develops into a blister filled with liquid and may be itchy or painful as the rash heals the lesions dry up crust over and fall offsome people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more these can appear anywhere on the body such as thepalms of hands and soles of feetface mouth and throatgroin and genital areasanussome people also have painful swelling of their rectum or pain and difficulty when peeingpeople with mpox are infectious and can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formedchildren pregnant people and people with weak immune systems are at risk for complications from mpoxtypically for mpox fever muscle aches and sore throat appear first the mpox rash begins on the face and spreads over the body extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and evolves over 24 weeks in stages  macules papules vesicles pustules lesions dip in the centre before crusting over scabs then fall off lymphadenopathy swollen lymph nodes is a classic feature of mpox some people can be infected without developing any symptomsin the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 caused mostly by clade iib virus the illness begins differently in some people in just over a half of cases a rash may appear before or at the same time as other symptoms and does not always progress over the body the first lesion can be in the groin anus or in or around the mouth people with mpox can become very sick for example the skin can become infected with bacteria leading to abscesses or serious skin damage other complications include pneumonia corneal infection with loss of vision pain or difficulty swallowing vomiting and diarrhoea causing severe dehydration or malnutrition sepsis infection of the blood with a widespread inflammatory response in the body inflammation of the brain encephalitis heart myocarditis rectum proctitis genital organs balanitis or urinary passages urethritis or death persons with immune suppression due to medication or medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death due to mpox people living with hiv that is not wellcontrolled or treated more often develop severe disease diagnosisidentifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar it is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox measles bacterial skin infections scabies herpes syphilis other sexually transmissible infections and medicationassociated allergies someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes alternatively a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox for these reasons testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and prevent further spread detection of viral dna by polymerase chain reaction pcr is the preferred laboratory test for mpox the best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash  skin fluid or crusts  collected by vigorous swabbing in the absence of skin lesions testing can be done on oropharyngeal anal or rectal swabs testing blood is not recommended antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxvirusesmore information on laboratory confirmation of mpox can be found heretreatment and vaccinationthe goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash manage pain and prevent complications early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problemsgetting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection the vaccine should be given within 4 days of contact with someone who has mpox or within up to 14 days if there are no symptomsit is recommended for people at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent infection with mpox especially during an outbreak this includeshealth workers at risk of exposuremen who have sex with menpeople with multiple sex partnerssex workerspersons who have mpox should be cared for away from other peopleseveral antivirals such as tecovirimat originally developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox and further studies are underway further information is available on mpox vaccination and case managementselfcare and preventionmost people with mpox will recover within 24 weeks things to do to help the symptoms and prevent infecting othersdostay home and in your own room if possiblewash hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer especially before or after touching soreswear a mask and cover lesions when around other people until your rash healskeep skin dry and uncovered unless in a room with someone elseavoid touching items in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequentlyuse saltwater rinses for sores in the mouthtake sitz baths or warm baths with baking soda or epsom salts for body sorestake overthecounter medications for pain like paracetamol acetaminophen or ibuprofendo notpop blisters or scratch sores which can slow healing spread the rash to other parts of the body and cause sores to become infected orshave areas with sores until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath this can spread the rash to other parts of the bodyto prevent spread of mpox to others persons with mpox should isolate at home or in hospital if needed for the duration of the infectious period from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off covering lesions and wearing a medical mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skintoskin or mouthtoskin

517pm the department of health doh on friday confirmed two more cases of monkeypox in the philippines bringing the total number of confirmed cases to three at a press briefing doh officerincharge maria rosario vergeire said the two new cases are aged 34 and 29 and both had recently traveled to countries with confirmed monkeypox cases vergeire declined to give details about the patients including their gender according to the doh official the 34yearold patients positive pcr result was released on august 18 while the 29yearold patients result was released on august 19 the 34yearold patient is under home isolation while contact tracing is ongoing according to vergeire the 29yearold case is currently in a healthcare facility to date 17 close contacts of the third case have been identified their details are being verified the doh said in a separate statement the first case of monkeypox in the country was a 31yearold patient who had traveled to a country with a known monkeypox case vergeire said the first patient was assessed as recovered by the physician and discharged from isolation on august 6 she said all 10 contacts of the first case had completed quarantine no laboratory for confirmatory testing had to be performed as they were all asymptomatic on final assessment she added note that the two new cases are not related to each other or to the first case the doh said no border closure vergeire also said there is no need to close the countrys borders despite the reported monkeypox cases hindi po natin kailangan gawin yon even the world health organization who in countries where there is mataas na kaso ng monkeypox does not recommend to close their borders vergeire said even the who does not recommend countries with a high number of monkeypox cases to close their borders hindi ho natin kailangan gawin yan ang kailangan ho natin gawin intensify further our surveillance system at kailangan din syempre impormasyon para sa ating mga kababayan para guided tayong lahat kung ano ang dapat nating gawin at ano ang dapat iwasan she said we dont need to do that what we need to do is to further intensify our surveillance system and of course we also need to inform our fellow filipinos on what to do and what to avoid she said that there was also a possibility that other cases were still not being detected vergeire encouraged the public to immediately consult doctors and isolate themselves if they have symptoms in order to prevent the spread of monkeypox according to the doh oic monkeypox and covid19 have different modes of transmission kung dati sa covid19 sumakay ka ng eroplano tapos may sakit ka we need to inform the entire mga kasamahan mo sa eroplano dahil yung posibilidad maaring mahawa ka ay nandoon dahil nga maari siyang magtravel sa air compared to monkeypox na direct contact skin to skin o intimate contact she said for covid19 when you ride on a plane and then you get sick we need to inform your fellow passengers because the possibility that you may be infected is there because the virus may travel by air compared to monkeypox which is through direct skintoskin or intimate contact so yun pong ating mga close contacts na kasakay niya sa eroplano yung mga katabi po niya kasama niya po sa contact tracing efforts but the other members or passengers hindi po natin kailangan at hindi po natin kailangan magpanic dahil dyan she added close contacts who were on the plane those next to the passenger will be included in the contact tracing efforts but the other members or passengers will not be included we dont need to panic because of that the doh earlier said monkeypox is a virus transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal or contaminated materials a viral infection resembling smallpox and first detected in humans in 1970 monkeypox is less dangerous and contagious than smallpox which was eradicated in 1980 the first symptoms can include a fever headaches sharp muscle pains fatigue a rash as well as swollen and painful lymph nodes according to an agence francepresse explainer the world health organization who on july 23 declared the monkeypox outbreak  which has affected nearly 16000 people in 72 countries according to a tally by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc  to be a global health emergency the highest alarm it can sound ninetyfive percent of cases have been transmitted through sexual activity according to a study of 528 people in 16 countries published in the new england journal of medicine everyone can help prevent the spread of monkeypox avoid close skintoskin contact with suspected cases especially those with rashes or open wounds keep hands clean wear a face mask cover coughs using the elbow and choose areas with good airflow the doh said the doh wishes to emphasize that anyone may get monkeypox if you have a travel history to countries with monkeypox and then have symptoms like fever lymphadenopathy or
