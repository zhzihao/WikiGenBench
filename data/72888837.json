{"id": 72888837, "key": "Mount Rushmore of Wrestling", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount%20Rushmore%20of%20Wrestling", "text": "Mount Rushmore of Wrestling or simply Mount Rushmore was a villainous professional wrestling faction in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) from 2013 to 2016.\n\nThe original incarnation, led by Adam Cole, was formed at the 2013 Battle of Los Angeles, when Kevin Steen formed an alliance with Cole and The Young Bucks called Mount Rushmore. The faction dominated PWG throughout the year until Steen and Cole departed the promotion in August and December, respectively, in the following year.\n\nThe second incarnation of Mount Rushmore was formed at Mystery Vortex III, where Young Bucks made their surprise return to PWG from Japan and formed an alliance with Roderick Strong and the returning Super Dragon. Cole would later rejoin the group in December after making his surprise return to PWG during All Star Weekend 11. The group would disband quietly in 2016.\n\nMount Rushmore was a very influential faction in PWG and is widely considered the most famous stable in the promotion's history.\n\nConcept\nIn an interview on AEW Unrestricted, Adam Cole revealed that Kevin Steen was considering options of creating further ideas for his PWG career, so he pitched the idea of turning heel and forming a faction with Cole and The Young Bucks in PWG after having wrestled as a face for a very long time. Young Bucks called themselves the \"Mount Rushmore of PWG\" and the name \"Mount Rushmore of Wrestling\" stuck.\n\nHistory\n\nMount Rushmore (2013–2014)\nThe PWG World Champion Adam Cole and the PWG World Tag Team Champions The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) were paired up to compete in six-man tag team matches at the 2013 Battle of Los Angeles. Cole and the Bucks defeated T.J. Perkins and Forever Hooligans (Alex Koslov and Rocky Romero) on the first night, and the team of AR Fox, Candice LeRae and Rich Swann on the second night. Later, Cole confronted his former Future Shock tag team partner Kyle O'Reilly after the latter won the 2013 Battle of Los Angeles tournament. Cole sarcastically congratulated O'Reilly on his win as \"the second best member of Future Shock\" which infuriated O'Reilly, who proceeded to attack Cole. Young Bucks rushed to attack O'Reilly. LeRae tried to make the save but was attacked as well. Joey Ryan confronted the Bucks and Cole on attacking LeRae claiming that only he had the right to attack LeRae and he prompted to attack Cole, which led to Bucks assaulting Ryan. Finally, the referee Rick Knox and Kevin Steen made the save but Steen turned into a villain by betraying Knox as he attacked him with a package piledriver. Steen delivered another package piledriver to LeRae and subsequently formed a new faction with Cole and the Bucks called Mount Rushmore.\n\nPWG's following event Matt Rushmore was named after the group, where the new faction made its first appearance together by interrupting Excalibur and bullying him. At the event, Steen defeated ACH, while Young Bucks defended the World Tag Team Championship against Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan, who had formed an alliance after being attacked by Mount Rushmore at Battle of Los Angeles. Young Bucks retained the titles. Cole defended the World Championship against Battle of Los Angeles winner Kyle O'Reilly, and retained after assistance by Mount Rushmore. Mount Rushmore attacked O'Reilly after the match prompting several PWG wrestlers including Johnny Gargano to make the save. Gargano challenged Cole to a match for the World Championship, which was made official for the second night of All Star Weekend 10. On the first night of the All Star Weekend 10, Steen and the Bucks defeated AR Fox and The Inner City Machine Guns (Rich Swann and Ricochet). Later that night, the trio interfered in Cole's World Championship defense against Chris Hero and helped Cole in retaining the title. On the second night of the event, Steen and the Bucks lost a match to AR Fox, Candice LeRae and Rich Swann. However, the trio helped Cole in retaining the World Championship against Johnny Gargano in the main event.\n\nCole and Steen represented Mount Rushmore in the 2014 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament by participating under the team name Cole Steen Cole. The duo defeated Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan in the quarterfinals and Cole proceeded to spit LeRae in the face after the match. Later in the night, LeRae interfered in Cole Steen Cole's semifinal match against eventual winners Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent?) and got her payback by spitting Cole in the face, allowing Best Friends to win. At Mystery Vortex II, Cole helped Young Bucks in retaining the World Tag Team Championship against Best Friends and then issued an open challenge for the World Championship, which was answered by LeRae. Cole defeated her to retain the title.\n\nAt Sold Our Souls For Rock 'n Roll, Steen and the Young Bucks defeated Cedric Alexander, Johnny Gargano and Trevor Lee. Later that night, the trio unsuccessfully interfered in Cole's World Championship title defense against Kyle O'Reilly in a Knockout or Submission only match, resulting in O'Reilly defeating Cole for the title. At Eleven, Cole failed to earn a World Championship title shot as he lost to Roderick Strong in a #1 contender's match, Steen wrestled his farewell match in PWG against Trevor Lee, which he lost, and the Young Bucks lost the World Tag Team Championship to The World's Cutest Tag Team (Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan) in a Guerrilla Warfare. After the match, Steen and Cole joined the Bucks for Steen's farewell. Cole and the Bucks turned on Steen by hitting him with a triple superkick. Steen subsequently left PWG to sign with WWE in August, thus leaving Mount Rushmore in the process.\n\nCole and the Bucks lost to Men of Low Moral Fiber (Chuck Taylor and Kenny Omega) and Zack Sabre Jr. on the first night of the 2014 Battle of Los Angeles. On the second night, Cole participated in the namesake tournament, losing to Sabre in the opening round while the Bucks defeated Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian) in the main event. On the third night, Cole and the Bucks defeated ACH, Brian Myers and Chris Sabin. At Untitled II, Cole lost to Trevor Lee in a shocking upset while the Bucks defeated African American Wolves (ACH and AR Fox). At Black Cole Sun, Cole wrestled his farewell match in PWG, in which he defeated Cedric Alexander, while the Bucks lost a match to Chris Sabin and Matt Sydal. Cole then departed PWG because Ring of Honor (ROH) began pulling its contracted wrestlers from competing on independent shows without the company's permission, which largely stemmed from the ROH World Champion Michael Elgin losing to Trevor Lee in the 2014 Battle of Los Angeles. Cole was among those contracted wrestlers and therefore could not appear in PWG. It temporarily disbanded Mount Rushmore.\n\nMount Rushmore 2.0 (2015–2016)\nAfter a four-month absence, the Young Bucks made a surprise return to PWG at Mystery Vortex III on June 26, 2015, by interrupting the new World Tag Team Champions Andrew Everett and Trevor Lee and challenging them to an immediate title match. The World Champion Roderick Strong interfered in the match and helped Young Bucks in defeating Everett and Lee to win the World Tag Team Championship. Strong and the Bucks fended off attacks by The World's Cutest Tag Team, Johnny Gargano and referee Rick Knox until Super Dragon made his surprise return to PWG apparently to rescue Knox. However, Dragon instead turned on Knox and delivered a Psycho Driver to Knox and put on a Mount Rushmore 2.0 shirt. Dragon then proceeded to attack Excalibur, Candice LeRae, Everett, Lee, Biff Busick and Mike Bailey. Strong then announced the formation of the new Mount Rushmore with Dragon and the Bucks.\n\nAt Threemendous IV, Super Dragon attacked Ricochet after the latter's win over Akira Tozawa. Joey Ryan, Candice LeRae and Johnny Gargano tried to make the save but Young Bucks aided Dragon in attacking them which culminated with Dragon hitting a curb stomp to LeRae into the turnbuckle. Mike Bailey and Akira Tozawa tried to make the save but were attacked until Los Güeros del Cielo (Angélico and Jack Evans) made the save. Bucks then successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Angélico and Evans. At the first night of the 2015 Battle of Los Angeles, Strong and the Bucks defeated Euro Trash (Marty Scurll, Tommy End and Zack Sabre Jr.). On the night two, Dragon and the Bucks defeated Andrew Everett, Biff Busick and Trevor Lee in a Guerrilla Warfare. On the third night, the entire Mount Rushmore faction defeated Angélico, Fenix and Inner City Machine Guns in an eight-man tag team match. Dragon was injured in the match, forcing him to retire.\n\nOn the first night of All Star Weekend 11, Bucks successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa, while Strong retained the World Championship against Matt Sydal. On the second night, Mount Rushmore was scheduled to take on Chris Hero, Mike Bailey and The World's Cutest Tag Team in a Guerrilla Warfare but Super Dragon was unable to compete due to injury. Adam Cole made his surprise return to PWG and substituted for Dragon, thus rejoining Mount Rushmore. However, Mount Rushmore went on to lose the match. Strong hesitated to make friends with Cole but accepted him in the group. At Lëmmy, Cole defeated Mike Bailey while Strong retained the World Championship against Chris Hero. At Bowie, Cole defeated Andrew Everett and Strong retained the World Championship against Drew Galloway.\n\nOn the first night of All Star Weekend 12, Strong defeated Mark Andrews in a non-title match, Cole lost to Strong's #1 contender Zack Sabre Jr., and the Bucks retained the World Tag Team Championship against Matt Sydal and Ricochet. On the second night, Cole lost to Trent?, Bucks retained the tag team titles against reDRagon (Bobby Fish and Kyle O'Reilly) and Strong lost the World Championship to Sabre. At Prince, Cole defeated Dalton Castle and Strong defeated Sami Callihan. \n\nAt Thirteen, Cole defeated Brian Cage, the Bucks retained the World Tag Team Championship against Death By Elbow (Chris Hero and JT Dunn) and Strong failed to regain the World Championship from Zack Sabre Jr. in a no disqualification match. It was Strong's farewell match in PWG as he departed the promotion to sign with WWE. Strong held a farewell celebration with Cole and the Bucks, who were about to turn on him just like they turned on Steen two years prior at Eleven but Sabre made the save.\n\nOn the first night of the 2016 Battle of Los Angeles, Cole and the Bucks defeated Dalton Castle and reDRagon. On the second night, Cole and the Bucks lost to Matt Sydal, Ricochet and Will Ospreay in a match which received unanimous praise from wrestling critics. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awarded it the prestigious 5-star rating and SoCal Uncensored readers voted it the 2016 Southern California Match of the Year. This was the last mention of Mount Rushmore in PWG.\n\nCole and the Bucks would team together the next time in PWG at Only Kings Understand Each Other by using the name Superkliq, a sub-group of The Elite, thus quietly disbanding Mount Rushmore.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nPro Wrestling Guerrilla\nPWG World Championship (2 times) – Cole (1), Strong (1)\nPWG World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson\n\nSoCal Uncensored\nSouthern California Match of the Year Award (2016) – \nSouthern California Tag Team of the Year Award (2014, 2015) – The Young Bucks\nSouthern California Wrestler of the Year Award (2013) – Adam Cole\n\nWrestling Observer Newsletter\nBest Wrestling Maneuver (2014) – \nTag Team of the Year (2014–2016) – The Young Bucks\n\nReferences\n\nIndependent promotions teams and stables", "unikey": "Mount Rushmore of Wrestling", "summary": "Mount Rushmore of Wrestling or simply Mount Rushmore was a villainous professional wrestling faction in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) from 2013 to 2016.\n", "outlines": ["Concept", "History", "Championships_and_accomplishments", "References"], "contents": ["In an interview onAEW Unrestricted,Adam Colerevealed thatKevin Steenwas considering options of creating further ideas for his PWG career, so he pitched the idea ofturningheeland forming a faction with Cole andThe Young Bucksin PWG after having wrestled as afacefor a very long time.

hurricanrana but he slipped cage hit a buckle bomb and went for another power bomb but aerostar countered it into a yoshi tonic for a 2 count aerostar went for a dive off the top but cage caught him and held him in the suplex position before dropping him down into a sick tombstone for the win holy s winner brian cage star rating 14  this was a very good opener it wasnt smooth in some parts with a couple of big moves botched but overall this was a good big man vs little man match 2 biff busick vs andrew everett in a 2015 bola first round match the crowd was clearly behind busick before the match began they went to a fast paced exchange and came to a stalemate after everett flipped over busick everett was strutting around and he paid for it as busick nailed him with a huge chop they did a similar spot a short time later and busick nailed everett with a huge release suplex everett rolled to the floor and busick followed him everett countered a powerbomb attempt on the floor into a hurricanrana everett then hit a springboard ssp to the floor the wiped out busick they went back and forth everett missed a moonsault and tried to roll through but busick obliterated him with a clothesline for a 2 count everett countered a suplex attempt and got an okana roll for a near fall everett flipped out of an ankle lock attempt from busick and nailed him with a drop sault busick got a single leg crab and transitioned into the stf he then applied the bank statement but everett got the ropes and the fans booed everett fired back and ducked a charge in the corner before nailing busick with a pele kick everett flipped out of an enzuguri and hit a no hands reverse hurricanrana for a nearfall holy s they battled up top a short time later everett dropped busick headfirst on top

held on but everett fought him off everett countered a judo throw attempt from busick and hit a lightning spiral for a 2 count on busick and both men were down wow everett went up top and hit a phoenix splash but didnt connect fully he managed to get a near fall and the fans fired up huge everett hit a big right and busick got the look of death in his eyes he began slapping everett in the face but everett fired back with a kick busick went for a half and half suplex from inside of the ring to the apron but everett block it everett went for a springboard ssp but busick nailed him with an uppercut he followed up with a half and half suplex busick finished the sequence with a running european uppercut for the win holy st winner biff busick star rating 34  this was an excellent match some of the sequences werent smooth but busicks power vs everett high flying was incredible to watch unfold especially the spot where busick flipped out of a german landed on his feet and hit an inverted hurricanrana this was fantastic 3 mark andrews vs william ospreay in a 2015 bola first round match both men shook hands before going at it and andrews kissed ospreays hand ospreay acted flattered andrews sent ospreay out and set up for a dive but ospreay tripped him ospreay went off the ropes and andrews popped up and nailed him with a dropkick for a 2 count ospreay cartwheeled out of a hurricanrana attempt and hit a leg lariat followed by a standing ssp for a 2 count wow ospreay went to work on andrews and set up for an arm submission he folded andrewss arms behind his head and leaned back on his top arm with a bridge before losing the hold they went to a nifty spot where andrews flipped over ospreay in the corner right into a tornado ddt and both men were down andrews hit a standing full twist moonsault for a 2 count a short time later ospreay ducked an enzuguri and went right after andrews but he countered ospreay right into a stunner they went back and forth and ospreay hit a powerslam and rolled through right into a running spiral tap for a 2 count are you kidding me the fans chanted both these guys ospreay set up in the corner and nailed andrews who was down on his knees with a spinning kick to the head andrews countered ospreay and rolled him up for a near fall ospreay tucked andrews head between the ropes when he set up for a dive and nailed him with a superkick he then set up for a super reverse hurricanrana but andrew held on he then jumped backwards and spiked ospreay with a reverse hurricanrana off the turnbuckles andrews that hit a dragoncanrana for a near fall and the fans went crazy are you kidding me andrews went up top for a ssp but ospreay got out of the way ospreay hit a front flip ddt and went up top he hit a backwards 450 for the win wow winner will ospreay star rating   this was an amazing sprint of a match with both guys pulling out some amazing counter sequences throughout the match while mixing in some spectacular highflying there wasnt much psychology here and youll probably forget this match when the show is over due to the quality of the card but this was nuts at times 4 los gueros del cielo jack evans  angelico vs inner city machineguns ricochet  rich swann ricochet wiped out angelico with a dropkick and did some breakdancing that really fired up the crowd evans tagged in and challenged swann to a dance contest the fans chanted for evans to dance evans then did some sick break dancing and walked on his hands the fans chanted you got served at swann swann then took his turns and danced but the crowd booed swann then did a turnaround double bird salute he then tried to do some sort of a flip into the mat and landed right on his head angelico and evans then began tagging in and out to work him over they targeted swanns arm as they worked him over swann fired back and tried to jump off angelicos head into a hurricanrana on evans but he slipped he still made the hot tag to ricochet and ran wild these guys have to be sweaty given the amount of botched spots ive seen on this show swann hit a flipping dlo style leg drop complete with a head bob on evans a short time later after tagging back in evans ended up taking a sustained beating from the icmg the fans calmed down after being jacked for the majority of the first three contests evans fired back and hit a double springboard neck breaker on swann and ricochet angelico got the hot tag and ran wild on ricochet and swann evans and angelico piled swann and ricochet on top of each other evans got on top of swann and hit a standing moonsault press on both men angelico made the cover on swann but only got a 2 count swann fired back and got a 2 count on angelico after hitting a backwards kick to the head evans blocked a benadriller attempt from ricochet and applied a stf ricochet struggled but managed to get to the ropes evans yelled at the ref after he made him break the hold ricochet and swann hit a combination of moves capped by a standing ssp from ricochet on evans but he kicked out at 2 angelico tripped ricochet from the floor and ran into the ring angelico and evans both got octopus submissions on swann and ricochet ricochet eventually spun evans off of him and right into angelico to break up both submissions angelico and ricochet went back and forth they eventually went to a big series of spots between all four men that ended with ricochet hitting a meteora on evans that left everyone down swann took a big right hand from evans a short time later and fired up big time with a nasty facial expression swann fired up and went to town on evans in the corner swann hit a reverse hurricanrana on evans to send him onto angelico but it didnt come off crisp and looked bad when evans just flipped onto angelico ricochet hit a springboard 450 for a near fall on angelico but missed a 630 off the top the match was a little disjointed down the stretch swann slipped out of a double team attempt and shoved angelico into the turnbuckles which crotched evans swann hit a springboard ace crusher for a 2 count this feels like it has lasted forever angelico launched evans into the turnbuckles with a huge razors edge he then wiped out ricochet with a dive over the ringpost to the floor evans then hit a 630 on swann for the win winnersjack evans  angelico  this had some fun sequences but it was really disjointed at times down the stretch they could have cut 10 minutes off this match and it would have been more palatable overall this was disappointing 5 trent vs trevor lee in a 2015 bola first round match lee obliterated trent with a big running kick from the apron to the floor and the fans fired up during the early going lee dominated the action for several minutes trent finally landed on his feet out of a german attempt and followed up with a tornado ddt that left both men down trent had the upper hand but lee cut him off with a leaping double stump for a 2 count trent returned the favor a short time later as he caught lee with a double stomp as he charged at him in the corning they ended up on the apron going back and forth with strikes lee finally hit a release german on the apron and both men fell to the floor as the fans gasped trent barely beat the 20 count and dove back into the ring right into a deadlift german from trent for a 2 count lee hit trent with kicks and strikes as he wobbled on his knees trent finally collapsed and lee set up behind him trent reversed a pinning combination and got one of his own for a 2 count trent went for another release german but trent turned it into a reverse hurricanrana for a 2 count wow they battled up top and lee fought trent off but trent popped up and hit a big release german off the top lee fired right back and hit a spinning powerslam for a near fall both men began exchanging slaps from their knees they got to their feet and continued to trade blows trent surprised lee with a flying knee to the head and the dude buster but lee kicked out holy st they went back and forth and lee finally got the win with a small package driver winner trevor lee star rating 34  this was a very good back and forth contest with some great exchanges and the near falls down the stretch were excellent trent and lee had to work to get the crowd back into the show after the previous match and they succeeded 6 drago vs pentagon jr in a 2015 bola first round match pentagon bumped into the ring announcer before she could even do the intros they went at it right away and drago nailed pentagon with a hurricanrana he followed up with a sick flip dive over the top to the floor and the fans went nuts pentagon fired back with a huge dropkick a short time later and the fans went nuts a big cero miedo chant broke out drago sent pentagon to the outside but he cut him off going for a baseball slide and hit ddt off the apron and onto a chair on the floor holy st drago sent pentagon to the floor and set up for a dive but pentagon ran into the ring and nailed him with a superkick pentagon set up for a dive but drago cut him off with a kick drago then hit a huge twisting splash over the top to the

driver but drago kicked out at the last second the fans broke out in a huge chant for both men they battled up top and drago hit a super hurricanrana for a near fall drago went for a splash but pentagon got out of the way and hit a running package piledriver for the win wow winner pentagon jr star rating   this was an amazing display of wrestling from two of aaas finest these guys went back and forth the entire way and had some spectacular exchanges that set the crowd on fire these guys just make you want to watch them thats how dynamic they are with their look and the way they carry themselves in the ring 7 fenix vs matt sydal in a 2015 bola first round match sydal got a nearfall with a sick counter that saw him float over fenix into a pinning combination for a near fall the ref didnt notice that fenix was in the ropes but it was still a very cool sequence sydal missed a standing moonsault but landed on his feet and nailed fenix with a huge kick fenix surprised sydal by jumping back into the ring and nailing him with an ace crusher he then got a running start but sydal popped into the ring and nailed him with a chop block sydal had the upper hand but fenix plastered him with a kick to the head as he went for a backdrop sydal fired back and went after fenixs leg sydal looked really good slowing the match down and picking apart fenixs leg with strikes and submissions fenix fired back and jumped up off the middle rope into a missile dropkick off the top rope sydal then surprised him with a running kick in the corner as the pace picked up fenix hit a double stomp off the top to the apron and wiped himself out on the top rope sydal crashed to the floor and fenix was down inside the ring as the fans fired up fenix hit a handspring rko and locked in a dragon sleeper he only had it with one arm and he transitioned into a shoulder lock he then transitioned into a border city stretch variation and sydal continued to struggle but he finally got the ropes wow fenix hit a standing moonsault for a 2 count and sydal got pissed but fenix went right back on the attack sydal countered a suplex and landed on top of fenix for a 2 count sydal fired back and hit a standing moonsault for a 2 count they went back and forth and fenix went for another double spring off the top but sydal nailed him with a leg lariat for a 2 count fenix went up top a short time later and hit an absolutely incredibly corkscrew dive to the floor to wipe out sydal and the fans fired up sydal flipped fenix up into the air as he came off the ropes but fenix came down with a dragoncanrana for a near fall holy st that was sick sydal fired back and jumped backwards off the ropes into a tornado ddt for a near fall wtf are you kidding me this is crazy sydal went up top but fenix jumped up and nailed him with a springboard kick off the second rope fenix then jumped up top with sydal and hit a one man springboard spanish fly for a very close near fall youve got to be kidding me sydal hit a reverse hurricanrana and went up top and hit a ssp that was good for the win ridiculous winner matt sydal star rating 12  just an amazing display of athleticism between sydal and fenix i thought i was watching a match straight out of the early 90s frommexico or japan the way these two were innovating during this match the second half of this match was like a highlight reel that i didnt want to end sabre went after strong before the main event and strong ducked in and out of the ring to avoid him strong ended up interrupting the ring intros strong tossed the mic at the ring announcer and told her to introduce them properly sabre picked up the mic and politely handed it to the ring announcer 8 eurotrash zack sabre jr  tommy end  marty scurll vs mt rushmore 20 pwg tag team champions matt jackson  nick jackson  pwg champion roderick strong in a sixman tag match matt ran right into a huge kick to the chest from end during the early going that completely obliterated him scurll got a nice rolling crucifix on nick but only got a 2 count nick yelled at scurll and spit on him scurll quickly fired back and got a rolling surfboard as the crowd roared with each rotation nick ended up raking scurlls eyes and he tagged in strong scurll cut strong off quickly and tagged in sabre who went right after strongs arm much to the delight of the crowd the pace picked up and end hit a springboard moonsault off the turnbuckles to the floor to wipe out the young bucks and the fans fired up once again scurll and sabre tied up the young bucks in the missionary position before turning them around into a double camel clutch end wiped out strong with a huge kick the young bucks managed to escape their predicament the young bucks fired back and cleared the apron they then began working over sabre in the middle of the ring sabre fired back and wiped out both of the yb he then tagged in end who ran wild mt rushmore 20 fired back and wiped out scurll with a combination of moves capped by an apron bomb from strong the young bucks then wiped out end and sabre with a double dive to the floor through the ropes they then hit a double apron bomb on end and sabre to end the sequence holy st the fans went nuts and chanted 20 strong chopped scurll as hard as he possibly could scurll fired up and began yelling so strong gave him an eye poke scurll fired back and hit a basement superkick on nick nick fired back with a superkick of his own but scurll bounced right off the ropes and nailed him with a clothesline and both men were down nick and scurll sat up and recreated undertaker and lesnar laughing at each other form summerslam 2015 matt went for a choke slam on scurll but he slid out of it and nick nailed him with a superkick that was awesome the young bucks then hit a double chokeslam on end brothers of destruction style but end broke up the pin the fans chanted indytaker at nick strong and scurll exchanged strikes until strong took him down with a jumping knee scurll slipped away from strong and broke his fingers apart strong fired back and went for a back breaker but scurll slipped out of it and hit a reverse suplex both men tagged out and sabre and nick went at it sabre went after nicks arm right away sabre eventually tied up nicks legs and then hit a suplex on matt the fans fired up as sabre went back and forth across the ring hitting uppercuts on nick and matt strong tried to run in but sabre caught him in an octopus position the yb broke it up with a double superkick and strong hit a powerbomb and the fans gasped sabre took a triple neck breaker powerbomb senton combination from mt rushmore 20 but he managed to kick out the pace picked up with both teams going back and forth the young bucks double team moves continually backfired on them they went to a big sequence that finally ended with end hitting a german on matt for a near fall that was just crazy especially sabre getting arm submissions on both yb only to have them broken up in spectacular fashion sabre and strong went at it and sabre caught a chop and stomped down on strongs arm at a bad angle strong fired back with a discus elbow but blocked the end of heartache and got a standing kimura strong drove sabre into the corner to break the hold strong got isolated and took a combination of moves from eurotrash capped by a double stomp from end off the top sabre then went for a crossarm breaker in the middle of the ring the young bucks finally ran in to make the save strong grabbed the ref and tossed him into sabre he then kicked sabre right in the junk and nailed him a chair shot end and scurll took some big chairshots to the head as well sabre managed to kick out he then took a series of moves in the corner from mt rushmore 20 strong then flipped nick into a 450 on sabre as he was hung on the ropes but end and scurll came out of nowhere for the save the fans went nuts and mt rushmore 20 hit a double meltzer driver on scurll and end the fans started a huge meltzer chant sabre was left alone in the ring he ended up taking a double superkick and a jumping knee at the same time strong finished him off with end of heartache for the win winners matt jackson  nick jackson  roderick strong star rating 14  this was a tremendous main event i wasnt a fan of the chair shots down the stretch although it looked like sabre end and scurll all got their hands up the match dragged a bit in some spots but it got really good down the stretch with mt rushmore 20 cheating to tilt the odds in their favor nick and end doing the undertaker and lesnar situp spot from summerslam 2015 just days after it took place was great as well overall thoughts 90  this was a tremendous show evans  angelico vs swann  ricochet was the only miss on the card everything else on the card was good to great sydal vs fenix stood out as a match that was truly special it was so innovative and simply amazing to watch several other matches on the card delivered huge as well with andrewsospreay pentagondrago and the main event sixman tag all being amazing matches the main event did a good job of furthering the heat on mt rushmore 20 while setting the stage

weekend but it was darn close they had some great hardhitting exchanges thatcher noselling the running bicycle kicks at times throughout the match was really great thatcher also has some really great facial expressions that make you believe hes in a real fight this match was great down the stretch and had a really nice finishing sequence 4 aerostar  fenix vs drago  pentagon jr in a tag team match aerostar and drago had some really good fast exchanges during the early going pentagon and fenix both made fancy entrances into the ring once they were tagged into the match they had a crazy exchange

later and drago caught him with an unreal tiltawhirl ddt for a 2 count unreal aerostar ended up alone in the ring but he managed to send pentagon to the floor with a hurricanrana that wasnt clean

huge pwg chant aerostar ended up catching pentagon with a huge back cracker fenix then lifted up drago and drilled him with a big piledriver both men made the cover and it was good for the double pin all four men raised their hands and the fans chanted please come back after the match was over winners aerostar and fenix star rating 14  there were some spots at times that werent very smooth but outside of that this was an amazing display of lucha libre that set the crowd on fire the double team maneuvers and highflying in this match were pure insanity this was tremendous 5 drew gulak vs

out of the corner and end nailed him with a straight right for the win winner tommy end star rating 14  this was a really good match with both guys really having a hard time getting on track the pace picked up and just when the match was getting really good end finished things with a straight right i didnt mind this finish at all 6 drew galloway vs speedball mike bailey in a 2015 bola round match the fans were chanting speedballs gonna kick you before the opening bell i do not think this will bode well for young speedball but i could be wrong speedball wrestles barefoot which i keep forgetting about galloway manhandled bailey during the early going and mocked him with a crane kick pose speedball fired up and lit up galloway with kicks and the fans fired up galloway finally blocked a kick and he slapped speedball right across the face bailey spun galloway around and nailed him with several slaps the ref dragged bailey out of the corner which allowed galloway to nail him with a running boot speedball went for an inside out springboard moonsault to the floor but galloway caught him and slammed him onto the apron bailey tried to mount a comeback and went for a handstand in the corner but galloway nailed him with a kick to maintain the upper hand galloway began targeting baileys leg as he worked him over galloway tossed bailey over the top and tied him up in the ropes before doing sheamuss punches which drew some boos from the fans the fans chanted for both men as bailey tried to make another comeback bailey came off the top but galloway caught him and ran him into the turnbuckles twice bailey sent galloway down to one knee with an enzuguri and then nailed him with his signature rapidfire kicksenzuguri combination bailey then hit a sick corkscrew plancha to the floor a short time later and the fans went nuts they went back and forth and bailey caught galloway with a nice ddt the fans fired up and chanted for speedball he followed up with a running tornado press but only managed a 2 count speedball followed up with a standing double knee moonsault wow bailey wound up like a pitcher and kicked galloway right across the head for a 2 count galloway fired back and caught bailey with a sitout spinebuster for a near fall galloway caught baileys legs in the corner and nailed him with a reverse alabama slam for another 2 count wow they battled up top and bailey hung galloway upside down with a knee strike galloway suddenly popped up and hit a spider bellytobelly galloway followed up with a sick kick but bailey kicked out at the very last second oh my god bailey caught galloway with a roundhouse kick to the head galloway fell to his knees and bailey connected with another roundhouse kick he made the cover but galloway simply grabbed him and picked him up bailey slid out of galloways clutches and nailed him with another kick to the head galloway simply bounced off the ropes and hit a tombstone for a near fall and the fans went nuts what a sequence that was galloway was in the ring on his knees and bailey hit a ssp double knee strike off the top but galloway kicked out at the very last sequence the fans lost their mind and chanted pwg pwg bailey countered a future shock ddt attempt a short time later into a flipping jackknife pin for the win that was insane winner mike bailey star rating   this was really fun bailey had an answer for just about everything galloway through at him and when he did get caught he managed to surprise galloway with a counter time after time this was a very good big vs small match but what made it unique was baileys ability to utilize his kicks throughout the match to keep galloway down this match also featured a tremendous finishing sequence 7 ricochet vs zack sabre jr in a 2015 bola round match ricochet acted cocky during the early going but sabre tripped him and rolled him up with a nifty bridging pinning combination for a near fall sabre had ricochet tied up on the mat until ricochet finally managed to escape and throw him off ricochet got a double arm submission and stood over sabre sabre tried to escape several times before he managed to kick ricochet away and they came to

some of his highflying but sabre had an answer and ricochet couldnt put him away they went back and forth down the stretch with sabre going for submissions and ricochet trying to hit the benadriller but neither man was successful really good stuff here especially the finishing sequence this match was even back and forth and sabre had to pull out a crazy pinning combination to get the win busick

rating   this was a brutal match that built from one big spot to the next they really came close to crossing the line several times especially with the tossing of the chairs to the head during certain portions of the match 20 cheated big time during the match and wiped out two refs and ultimately got the win in the end here this was a war dragon went around ringside and threw off several hats he then got into the face of several fans the fans chanted back and forth for and against dragon excalibur got on the mic and said he didnt know what to say he thanked the fans for joining them he said this is not over excalibur repeated himself and yelled this is not over by a f long shot he said he doesnt care who it takes or what it takes he said this is it excalibur said mt rushmore 20 is over he said hes sick of it the fans chanted for one more match excalibur said he doesnt need to do one more match he said there are four men that are just men excalibur said they have an entire locker room of men and one woman he said he would not rest until he saw them put in the ground he asked who should be on his team the fans chanted for tozawa the young bucks then ran out and wiped out excalibur with a double superkick and the fans booed dragon then hit a psycho driver on him through two chairs dragon stared at hero who was sitting on the commentary booth the fans chanted for hero who rushed the ring 20 bailed as the fans lost their minds chanting for hero hero ended up jawing with a fan that told him to bring it it turned out to be the super dragon fan the fans told hero that this is super dragons house the fans wanted hero to mess him up but dragon attacked him from behind the yb ended up hitting a superkick on hero but he got right up and nailed dragon with an elbow hero took another superkick and the yb tossed him into the ring dragon nailed hero with a psycho driver variation the fans chanted for end to come out nick got on the mic and said 20 has two words for them nick told the fans to suck and 20 left the ring to end the show overall thoughts 95  this was another incredible show featuring first round bola matches everything on the card delivered and the action was diverse throughout the night the show got off to a bit of a slow start in the ring by pwg standards even though the first two matches were good hero and thatcher then tore the house down with an excellent match that nearly matched their effort during wm weekend the show then continued at a rapid pace but it was nice that the endgulak match served as a bit of a breather before the show ended with three excellent matches and a hot showclosing angle from an inring standpoint you cant ask for much more than what this show delivered the main event was cringeworthy at times as chairs were introduced but the match was worked relatively safely most of the way given the stipulation 20 is a really fun heel stable to watch despite the fact that a good portion of the crowd cheers for them the postmatch angle was really good with 20 laying waste to every babyface and setting up a big revenge match for the third night overall this show gets a huge thumbs up and is highly recommended you

2016 reseda calif by sean radican pwtorch columnist this is my first review of a pwg bluray and the picture looks fantastic 1 chris dickinson vs brian cage dickinson is a regular in beyond wrestling which i follow regularly this is his pwg debut so its always nice to see someone advance from a place like beyond wrestling to pwg dickinson is a replacement for the injured angelico dickinson started the match with a running enzuguri and a backdrop driver he then went up top and hit a big splash into the crowd to wipe out cage and the fans went nuts cage couldnt catch dickinson coming off the top in the vertical suplex positon but he eventually landed a big spinning slam he then hit a tope con hilo and landed on his feet and the fans went nuts again hero was in on commentary and pointed out that these two men are friendly with each other they traded blows on the floor and cage ended up powerbombing cage into the ringpost they went back and forth in the corner until cage hit five consecutive lariats and then pulled dickinson out of the corner into a big lariat cage hit a hurricanrana followed by the 818 and the fans went nuts dickson fired back and hit a dragon suplex for a 2 count dickinson worked over cage and stepped on his handarm several times using the ropes for leverage they went back and forth and dickinson got a reverse boston crab on cage cage struggled but managed to get to the ropes and the fans fired up cage countered a hurricanrana attempt and hit a wheelbarrow suplex for a 2 count dickinson fired back with a wheelbarrow suplex of his own a short time later but cage kicked out at the last second on commentary excalibur talked about how generico steen and castagnoli were in mexico helping the orphans they battled up top and dickinson hit a

burning hammer for a near fall oh my god cage hit a series of powerbombs and a discus lariat but dickinson kicked out at 1 cage eventually hit the steiner screwdriver for the win winner brian cage star rating 14  they had some sloppy spots at times during the match and it seemed like they were just trading blows at first but the action got quite good down the stretch 2 drew gulak vs timothy thatcher they went back and forth on the mat during the early going gulak surprised thatcher with a huge slap but thatcher blocked a german attempt and went after gulaks arm gulak blocked a crossarm breaker and beautifully transitioned into an ankle lock but thatcher got to the ropes quickly thatcher went for a deadlift double wristlock but gulak slipped out of it and hit a german and the fans applauded that was a sick display of strength by thatcher gulak countered thatchers shoulder with a pair of sliding dropkicks gulak sat on top of thatcher and began wrenching his thumb apart from the rest of his fingers thatcher fired back and stepped on gulaks hand thatcher whipped gulak but held on and sent him flying into the mat shoulderfirst gulak got a backslide but thatcher kicked out and immediately went for an arm submission gulak tried to fight out of it but thatcher grabbed his fingers and snapped them apart violently and the fans gasped gulak fired back and hit a lariat out of the corner and it was only good for a 2 count as gulak couldnt put his injured arm across thatcher as he made the cover gulak hit several forearms and thatcher glared at him both men then connected with clotheslines at the same time before thatcher grabbed gulak and hit a saito suplex both men were down on the mat as the fans fired up thatcher eventually crawled over to gulak to make the cover for a 2 count thatcher was going after gulaks arm a short time later but gulak rolled through right into a piledriver on thatcher for a 2 count gulak went right into a crossarm breaker when thatcher kicked out thatcher struggled but managed to get to the ropes wow thatcher fired back and hit a deadlift gut wrench suplex that left both men down on the mat gulak suddenly countered thatcher and hit a variation of the regalplex with a bridge for a 2 count gulak nailed thatcher with several big slaps thatcher got to his feet and tried to cover up thatcher decked gulak with a surprise headbutt for a near fall he went right into the kimura for the tap out win and the fans exploded winner timothy thatcher star rating   this was an excellent technical wrestling match both guys went after the arm when they had the upper hand but they mixed in some fantastic hardhitting action as well the action down the stretch was really good both guys sold great intensity throughout the match building up to a satisfying finish 3 sami callihan vs trevor lee lee flipped off the fans when he got booed during the introductions callihan got a big pop when he was introduced callihan and lee glared at each other before going at it callihan spit at lee and lee spit back at him both men licked their faces and went at it once again the ref tried to separate both men as they struggled near the ropes callihan grabbed lee by the hair at one point before they finally came to a stalemate both men took their elastic out of their hair before going back at it callihan caught lee with a dive through the ropes a short time later and the battle spilled into the crowd as callihan began throwing chairs at him callihan threw several chairs into the ring but lee surprised him by tossing a chair at him and following up with a double stomp for a 2 count lee teased tossing callihan into the crowd but ended up tossing him back into the ring which drew some boos callihan blocked a kick from the apron to the floor and got lee on his shoulders before slamming him facefirst into the ring apron callihan hit a series of boot scrapes in the corner but lee surprised him by popping out of the corner callihan fired back with total anarchy a short time later but lee kicked out at 2 and both men were down wow lee snapped the rope into callihans face as he went after him near the apron and hit an uranagi and a superkick for a 2 count lee hit a roundhouse kick and hit a big german with a bridge for a near fall lee caught callihan as he charged at him and hit a flipping power slam for a near fall and both men were down both men got up and went at it traded blows on their knees callihan eventually hit a dragon screw and grabbed a figure four lee struggled but eventually got to the bottom rope to break the hold they went at it near the ropes callihan nailed lee with a stepup kick lees arm got caught in the ropes and callihan nailed lee with several running kicks callihan freed lee and nailed him with a liger bomb for a near fall callihan went right into the stretch muffler and lee tapped out even though he was right near the ropes winner sami callihan star rating   the finish hurt this match as lee was literally right next to the bottom rope and decided to tap out instead of grabbing it when callihan had him in the stretch muffler overall this match featured some good back and forth hardhitting action with both men trading big moves but overall there wasnt a ton of substance to this match evans cut a promo before his match began with galloway it was hard to hear what he was saying at first evans heeled on the fans and called him pro wrestlings one true god and mockingly said pwg had matched him up against drew galloway evans said he would give galloway a mercy option so galloways blood wouldnt be on his hands he then challenged galloway to a dance off the fans then clapped along like sheep as evans did some break dancing which allowed galloway to nail him with a huge dropkick that brought an end to the dance contest 4 jack evans vs drew galloway galloway has a huge size advantage in this match as hes just a gigantic man this is galloways first appearance in pwg since bola 2015 galloway threw evans around like a rag doll during the opening stages of the match galloway then did some dancing before nailing evans with a huge chop the fans chanted you got served at evans galloway nosold a dropsault from evans evans went for another and galloway nosold it again he then turned evans inside out with a diving lariat evans ran away from galloway and went under the ring galloway went under the ring but evans came around the other side and ambushed him evans went for a splash off the apron but galloway caught him on the floor and tossed him into the ringpost holy s galloway tried to charge at evans on the apron but missed and went into the ringpost evans then hit a double stomp off the apron to the shoulder evans went for a cartwheel into the corner but galloway caught him and hit a german into the turnbuckles he then hit a big spinning slam for a 2 count evans pulled the ropes on galloway who went to the floor evans then hit a sasuke special to the floor and the fans fired up evans taunted galloway with a slap and then nailed him with several kicks to the legs galloway caught evans with a huge right that spun him around as he came off the ropes galloway caught evans with a sick kick variation at short time later but evans kicked out at the very last second evans ducked a running boot in the corner and galloway ended up hung upside down evans stepped on his crotch but galloway managed to pop up and hit a spider german for a 2 count galloway got evans on his shoulders and climbed the turnbuckles he went for a slam off the top but evans countered it into a super ddt evans then went up top for a 630 but galloway got his knees up and hit a future shock ddt for the win winner drew galloway star rating 12  this was an awesome onesided beating with galloway tossing evans all around the ring after evans talked a ton of smack before the match evans mounted some nice comebacks and the crowd was into the action throughout the match the match ended a bit abruptly but this was enjoyable overall 5 mike bailey vs adam cole drew gulak joined excalibur on commentary cole interrupted the introductions and the announcer said cole wants to wish everyone a terrible new year this is a firsttime ever meeting between bailey and cole cole offered a clean break in the corner and said adam cole bay bay as the fans popped while he hit his pose cole offered another clean break in the opposite corner and hit his catch phrase and pose once again adam cole is an incredible man bailey tried to fire back but cole slapped him across the face cole went to hit his pose again but bailey wiped him out with a kick they went at it on the floor and bailey nailed cole with a kick against the apron they went to a fast exchange off the ropes bailey eventually jumped over cole and he spilled to the floor bailey slid through the ropes but cole caught and hit a wheel barrow suplex into the apron holy s the fans rallied behind bailey and chanted speedball but cole maintained the upper hand bailey caught cole with a kick but cole blocked a second kick attempt and hit a dragon screw before mocking bailey with a karate pose bailey fired up and went for the crane pose he then nailed cole with a pair of crane kicks that sent cole to the floor bailey followed up with an inside out springboard moonsault to the floor and the fans went nuts cole ducked two spinning kicks but bailey caught him with a third attempt he then hit a standing sliced bread variation for a 2 count bailey missed a shooting star knee on cole but cole superkicked his knee cole missed a jumping code red attempt off the turnbuckles and hit a standing shooting star double knee to coles chest for a 2 count cole fired back with a big neck breaker over his knee a short time later for a 2 count cole did some breathing exercises and mocked baileys karate pose once again cole sidestepped a kick and hit a running knee strike off the ropes for a 2 count wow cole told bailey to suck his d but ended up eating a roundhouse kick to the head and a running corkscrew press for a 2 count wow both men went back and forth exchanges kicks and punches bailey fired back with a flurry of rapidfire kicks in the corner cole then shoved the ref and hit bailey with a low blow for a near fall the fans booed and cole sold shock cole got bailey on his shoulders but bailey countered him and hit a hurricanrana he went up top but cole ran into the ropes to crotch him they battled up top and bailey sent cole to the mat with a big kick from the apron bailey hit a shooting star double knee strike to coles back but cole broke up the pin by grabbing the refs arm wow bailey hit his signature rapidfire kicks on cole capped by an enzuguri cole faked bailey out and hit a superkick to his leg bailey fired back and got a rollup for a 2 count bailey then surprised cole with an inside cradle for a 2 count they went back and forth and cole caught bailey with a superkick bailey countered a code red attempt off the turnbuckles but cole fired back and hit a code red that wasnt very smooth he then hit a brainbuster on to his knee for the win winner adam cole star rating 34  this match was a lot of fun with cole really showing why hes a future start with the way he commands the ring as a heel the code red that cole hit down the stretch wasnt executed cleanly and took a bit away from the finish but this was a lot of fun to watch most of the way through 6 zack sabre jr vs akira tozawa the fans chanted next world champ at sabre the fans then chanted back and forth for both men both men laid down on the mat as the fans continued to chant their names they then got up and the fans pounded the mat a big both these guys chant then broke out the fans then started chanting this is awesome wow a big pwg chant then rang out followed by a moty chant sabre and tozawa then decided to leave the ring and head to the back with the ref both men then ran back into the ring but the refs shoe fell off they went back and forth on the mat and came to a stalemate they went back and forth on the mat again and came to another stalemate sabre escaped from tozawas hold on the mat and hit the too easy pose both guys began exchanging blows in the middle of the ring tozawa finally decked sabre with a short right and the fans fired up and chanted his name tozawa hit his machine gun chops in the corner and then another short right that had the ref yelling at him the fans popped big and tozawa acted like he was trying to grasp a better understanding of the rules sabre caught tozawa coming through the ropes to the floor and got an octopus stretch he transitioned to a mounted double arm submission before tossing tozawa back into the ring sabre focused his attack on tozawas legs back inside the ring tozawa fired back with a bicycle kick and went for a dive but sabre got out of the way tozawa nailed sabre with another bicycle kick when he tried to get back into the ring tozawa then hit two dives

german with a bridge for a 2 count and the fans fired up big time sabre and tozawa went back and forth once again tozawa nosold a diving european uppercut and hit a flying knee strike and both men

position they decided to get up and they continued to exchange bombs they went back and forth and tozawa hit a german but sabre got right up and hit a dragon suplex sabre then killed tozawa with a penalty kick and it was over holy s winner zack sabre jr star rating   this was a really good match they went back and forth the entire match exchanging counters on the mat during the early going the match then moved towards fastpaced back and forth action with some great fighting spirit spots that built up to a really good finish my expectations for this match were sky high and they didnt disappoint but i was expecting more than they delivered the match seemed to end abruptly when i felt they could have gone a little longer and really built the match up to a fever pitch before going to the finish pwg champion roderick strong cut a promo before the main event where he was set to defend against chris hero the fans heckled him and strong told them to shut up strong said hes the best champion in all of wrestling he told rick knox to get out of the ring another ref came out to ref the match 7 pwg champion roderick strong vs chris hero hero was wearing fantastic cleveland cavaliers style ring gear hero jumped strong with a big running kick to start the match as strong was being introduced for a 2 count hero continued to try to put away strong quickly and he nailed him with a big elbow but strong managed to kick out at 2 hero shrugged off a chop from strong and nailed him with a huge elbow strike that sent strong down to the mat strong fired back and caught hero with a jumping knee strike near the apron he then hit a big back breaker on the apron a short time later strong dominated the action back inside the ring for several minutes strong taunted hero and he responded to a chop with a short right and both men were down on the mat strong got the upper hand again hero fired up and nosold a chop they began exchanging blows in the middle of the ring hero finally caught strong who was leaping at him with a huge elbow both men were once again down on the mat hero mounted a comeback and set strong with a diving elbow off the ropes he made the cover but strong managed to kick out at 2 strong fired back with a series of running elbows off the ropes and then he lifted hero and slammed him facefirst into the mat for a 2 count strong placed hero up top a short time later hero fired back and elbowed strong off the turnbuckles hero fought strong off once again he then set up for a piledriver off the turnbuckles but strong escaped and nailed him with a kick to the head strong went for a superplex and landed it but hero kicked out at 2 strong then hit a combination of moves capped by a sick kick for a near fall wow both men were slow to get to their feet after that exchange strong finally got up and went for the strong hold but hero countered it into a rollup for a 2 count hero then hit a short piledriver and the fans applauded hero then hit a jumping piledriver but strong kicked out at the last second hero went on the attack but strong shoved the ref into him as he came off the ropes the fans booed as strong hit a liger bomb rick knox ran out and counted a near fall strong glared at knox and the announcers said there were only 2 referees in the building hero tried to exchange chops with strong but he didnt seem to have much behind them hero began firing back with elbows and then a big kick to the head and strong went down strong blocked a kick but hero kicked him in the head with his other foot hero went for the death blow but strong shoved knox in the way and hero nailed him with it the fans booed as there were no refs left at the moment hero ate a jumping knee strike but then countered strong and hit a tombstone the other official crawled into the ring and slowly counted strong barely kicked out at the last second and the fans booed wow strong went for a belt shot but hero ducked it and nailed him with a bicycle kick he set up for a powerbomb but strong nailed him with a belt shot to escape and then another belt shot followed by a sick kick hero kicked out at one strong hit a pair of jumping knees and a sick and hero stayed down for the pin winner roderick strong to retain the pwg world championship star rating 14  this was a fantastic hardhitting match the match started a bit slow but the second half was really strong with some really good hardhitting action strong using the refs to save himself from hero landing a big move late in the match added to the drama so i didnt mind the ref bumps given that strong got even more heat as a result of them strong eventually got the win but not after a lot of shenanigans late in the match postmatch the fans chanted we want sabre after the match adam cole came out and applauded strong after the match was over strong posed with the title as the fans booed he told the fans he hates every single one of them zack sabre jr then came out and waved at strong the fans chanted next world champ at strong he called cole a csucker it was hard to hear what he was saying he seemed to indicate that he wanted a shot at the title strong cut a promo backstage strong said hes the best wrestler in the world and yelled about sabre cole came into the picture and told him sabre was playing mind games cole said he had a gift for strong and he gave him a signed picture cole said strong is his best friend strong reached over to the side and grabbed his shirt and gave it to cole cole walked away and strong tore the picture apart cole was then shown spitting on the strong shirt and tossing it on the ground to end the show overall thoughts 85  pwg sets such a high bar that when a show doesnt have a total blowway match it can feel like a letdown of sorts that being said this was a heck of a show thats wellworth checking out you wont find a motyc on here but the action once again was fantastic all of the matches were in the threestar range or higher thatchergulak sabretozawa and herostrong were the highlights of the show all of these matches are wellworth checking out its no secret that pwg features the best inring action in front of the hottest fans on the independent scene this was once again a great crowd and top to bottom the show delivered the first standout match on the undercard was thatchergulak theyve had some excellent matches in beyond wrestling and evolve so to see them have a technical match in front of an appreciative pwg crowd was a lot of fun there were a couple of matches that stood out in the threestar range on the undercard i really enjoyed galloway beating the hell out of jack evans after evans talked some trash before the match began i could have watched another five to ten minutes of galloway just beating the crap out of evans and evans mounting his highflying comebacks baileycole was also really good cole is such a great heel and sometimes its hard to believe hes not pushed better than he is in roh the way he carries himself in the ring cole does a lot of the little things right to suck the fans into the story of wanting to see him get his ass handed to him later in the show sabretozawa had my expectations sky high tozawa has had some great matches in pwg in the past and just seeing him in pwg is a rare occurrence the fans were chanting all of the standard independent chants before the match and then they began chanting this is awesome and match of the year before the match even began it was great when sabre and tozawa went to the back together and teased that their work for the night was done before getting back into the ring the match was really good with some mat work during the early going and then some fantastic back and forth rapidfire action with some big moves mixed in leading to the finish the match actually seemed to be just really getting going when it ended i really hope to see these two go at it again one day as this is simply a match that you wont find anywhere else besides pwg the main event took a bit to get going but stronghero really turned things up several notches during the second half of the match strong used just about every cheap tactic he could to retain the pwg championship as there were a couple of ref bumps hero seemed to be on the verge of victory several times but strong ultimately got the win thanks in part to him shoving the refs in heros path one of the issues during the show that hurt it a bit was that the ring mic doesnt sound very clear this was the case for roderick strongs postmatch promo sabre then came out to presumably challenge strong for the pwg championship but it was hard to hear was he was saying hopefully pwg can clean this up in the future overall given the quality of action up and down the card

20160526 155300 pwg dvds can be ordered at wwwhighspotscom pwg returned for another all star weekend with night one taking place on march 4th in reseda california as usual it was a stacked card with some of the finest independent wrestling talent in the world chuck taylor defeated trevor lee this was a fun opener and another big upset win for taylor to continue his pwg winning streak there was some comedy in the early going with both guys brawling around the announce table and getting in on commentary lee played such a great heel and used lots of shortcuts and tricks to get the upper hand on taylor taylor has become such a great underdog in pwg almost like a cross between toru yano  tomoaki honma taylor won when he countered a small package driver into a small package to get the pin chris hero defeated evil uno a pretty good match here they were goofing around with chairs and it looked like uno was going to playfully challenge hero to a staring contest but he misted hero to take control of the match uno controlled the majority of this with hero on defence kicking out and trying to survive this continued until hero got pissed off at uno using his piledriver and elbows on him this led to hero delivering a series of elbow strikes to get the pin this was good but not as good as either mans match at last months show trent defeated drew galloway after what was considered a breakout performance against chris hero at bowie the previous month pwg were looking to capitalise on that here as trent was positioned as the babyface in peril and the underdog here against galloway this was another fantastic match and another great babyface performance from trent galloway floored him with a headbutt and took control of the match where galloway dished out an incredible beating trent got back into it with a belly to belly from the top but galloway then hit trent with a belly to belly on the floor trent did all he could to survive and delivered a defiant slap to galloway before galloway delivered a series of buckle bombs he went for a piledriver but trent countered into the dudebuster to steal the win trent is one of the most underrated wrestlers around today roderick strong defeated mark andrews this was a good match that almost fell apart when andrews was seemingly knocked out but they recovered it well strong beat down and tossed andrews around andrews came back with lots of lightning quick wheelbarrow moves ranas and an awesome tornado ddt andrews was dropped on the apron with a backdrop strong tossed him up in the air for a gutbuster but andrews seemed to land on his head and looked like he was out of it for a few minutes strong hit end of heartache and pulled andrews out of the pin he went for a sabre armbar but andrews almost caught him with a pin there was a small bit of back and forth but andrews still seemed out of it strong won with a second end of heartache as he moves on to defend his title against zack sabre jr the next night kyle oreilly defeated marty scurll this match was absolutely amazing just a superb technical wrestling match and the perfect return to pwg or kyle in his first singles match back early in the match he worked over the leg if scurll and attempted ankle locks scurll went for an arm and teased the chicken wing there was one amazing exchange of strikes in the middle of this with both guys lunging at each other with lariats ending with both guys going down after stiff slaps scurll mounted kyle and delivered repeated elbows kyle delivered repeated boots and knees as they went back and forth as neither got the advantage scurll locked in a chicken wing and the crowd were sure it was over as were the commentators scurll kicked out of a brainbuster then kyle transitioned into an ankle lock to get the submission win this was incredible and worth seeking out especially if you have never seen scurll before hes one of the best on the indie scene at the minute zack sabre jr defeated adam cole this was another great match the story surrounding this was that cole had a chance to soften up sabre for his mount rushmore buddy roderick strong cole spent the match going after the knee of sabre and he did it brilliantly he used holds superkick dropped him knees first on the apron sabre came back with flash pin attempts and by tying cole in knots he hit some really hard uppercuts and kicks too cole began getting frustrated when he couldnt beat sabre after he hit the florida key strong appeared and almost cost sabre the match but sabre kicked out of a roll up the finish came when sabre hit a pk and made cole submit to a strong hold right in front of the champion this was a great match and it did a great job of building to a title match that has been several months in the making pwg world tag team championship the young bucks defeated ricochet  matt sydal this was a spectacular aerial main event you know what to expect from teams like this it had flying crazy double team superkicks near falls and big dives sydal  ricochet were the iwgp jr tag champions at the time and had just won them from the bucks in njpw the bucks pulled out some new double team moves here sydal was very aggressive ricochet hit a corner dive where he flew half way up the aisle the finish of this had far too much action to keep up with the bucks used a can of spray and almost stole the win ricochet caught nick in mid air when he attempted a meltzer driver sydal  ricochet went for the stereo shooting stars but both bucks got their knees up leading to a flurry of superkicks and a meltzer driver to win the match after the match mount rushmore attacked everyone and strong said he wants to do it alone and end sabre tomorrow night this show was awesome every single match was at least
