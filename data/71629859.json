The series received mixed reviews, but was received favourably by the LGBTQ+ press with Attitude, Gay Times and The Queer Review featuring the series on their lists of Top LGBT TV Shows of 2022.\n\nThe show was renewed for a second series in October 2022, set for a 2023 broadcast.\n\nCast\n\nMain\n Oscar Kennedy as Jamie Walsh/\"Cormac Kelly\", a nineteen-year-old who takes a job on the Sacramentum to find out what happened to his sister\n Thaddea Graham as Vivian Lim, one of Jamie's colleagues who works on the Sacramentum after fleeing her homophobic family \n Jack Rowan as Danny Jones, Pippa's ex-boyfriend and a member of the entertainment team \n Anthony Rickman as Olly Reyes, a member of the Sacramentum's crew who befriends Jamie and Vivian\n Louis Boyer as Sam Rhodes, an officer on the Sacramentum \n Alice Nokes as Sophia Leigh, queen bee of the Sacramentum's entertainment team\n Peter Claffey as Cormac Kelly, Jamie's friend with whom he switches identities in order to get onto the Sacramentum\n Miya Ocego as Rosie Preston, Comac's ex-girlfriend and a transgender woman who works as a Cher impersonator\n Jodie Tyack as Pippa Walsh, Jamie's sister who disappeared while working on the Sacramentum\n\nRecurring\n Harriet Webb as Karen MacIntyre, the crew manager of the Sacramentum\n Warren James Dunning as Officer Beaker, an officer on the Sacramentum and Karen's second-in-command\n Amber Grappy as Lauren Thompson, one of Jamie and Vivian's colleagues\n Diego Andres as Jerome Dupont, one of Jamie and Vivian's colleagues\n Louise Parker as Jenny, one of Jamie and Vivian's colleagues\n Georgia Goodman as Dolce, a cleaner on the Sacramentum\n James Phoon as Hamish Campbell, a member of the Sacramentum's entertainment team\n Ali Hardiman as Bethany-May, a member of the Sacramentum's entertainment team\n Melissa Dilber and Merih Dilber as Amy #1 and Amy #2, twin sisters who are members of the Sacramentum's entertainment team\n Ramanique Ahluwalia as Lily Tee, a wealthy guest on board the Sacramentum\n Ned Costello as Nile, a wealthy guest on board the Sacramentum and Lily's stepbrother\n Donald Sage Mackay as Henry Allan, the director of the Sacramentum\n Francis Flores as The Baby, the Sacramentum's tattooist\n Marcia Lecky as Detective Martinez, a detective who boards the Sacramentum to investigate a suspicious death\n\nProduction\nBBC Three commissioned Wrecked from Euston Films in March 2021. Written by Ryan J. Brown and directed by Chris Baugh, the six 45-minute episode series is executive produced by Noemi Spanos for Euston Films and Tommy Bulfin for the BBC.\n\nWhile writing the show, Brown purposefully included explicit LGBT themes (both Jamie and Vivian are gay), explaining that \"as a gay man and horror fan, I think horror has always been queer but it's always coded, and subtext. I thought, 'let's do away with the subtext. Let's have explicit representation\" and adding that he was used to LGBT characters always being the sidekicks in horror content. Simultaneously, Brown was careful to ensure that Jamie and Vivian's sexuality did not define them as characters but that he did not dismiss this either, noting that \"growing up gay has equipped them to be the perfect heroes but the story doesn't need to be about their trauma\".\n\nThe cast was confirmed in March 2022, with Oscar Kennedy set to star as the lead Jamie. Also part of the cast were Thaddea Graham, Jack Rowan, and Jodie Tyack as well as Louis Boyer, Anthony Rickman, Amber Grappy, Diego Andres, Peter Claffey, Miya Ocego, Warren James Dunning, Ramanique Ahluwalia, and Alice Nokes. In a video posted to Instagram, Brown explained that Jamie is named after Jamie Lee Curtis, best known for playing Laurie Strode in the Halloween film franchise, and Jesse Walsh, the character played by Mark Patton in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge, whom he dubbed the \"first male scream queen\".\n\nPrincipal photography took place in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn October 2022, prior to the first series' broadcast, it was announced that a second series of the show has been in development, and that the show was designed to run for at least three.\n\nPrincipal photography for the second series returned to Northern Ireland and lasted for four months between May 11 and September 1, 2023.\n\nEpisodes \nAll episodes were made available on BBC iPlayer on October 9, 2022, prior to their linear broadcast.\n\nCritical reception\n\nBoth Attitude and Gay Times featured Wreck on their list of Top LGBT TV Shows of 2022.\n\nIn a four-star review, Benji Wilson of The Telegraph praised the premise and Chris Baugh's directing and described the series as being like a punk band at their first gig stating, \"Wreck’s energy is infectious. Everyone on the ship is a suspect and no-one can get off. If that’s just Death on the Nile with ADHD, fine: I still want to know whodunit. And why they’re wearing a duck mask.\" Similarly, Neil Baker from Cinerama lauded BBC Three for commissioning the show, and referred to Wreck'''s killer duck as a \"slasher icon\". He called Brown's screenplay \"as sharp as the knife our devilish duck wields\", noting his ability to reference classic horror properties such as Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and Friday the 13th while still allowing Wreck to feel \"fresh and different to anything else we have seen\", and praised the series' humour, pacing, cinematography and queer representation. The show also received four-star reviews from Heat, which declared it a \"stylish\" and \"fresh, vibrant, chilling horror treat\", and TVTimes, who noted that the show \"delivers jump-scares and witty one-liners with equal aplomb\". In their round-up of new shows, NME referred to Wreck as a \"comic-horror delight\" and a \"mischievous slasher in the vein of Scream\".\n\nIn a wider article praising the series' queer and Asian representation, Alistair James of Attitude stated \"the inclusion of LGBTQ characters doesn’t feel tokenistic or as if it’s been done to check a box. Therefore it’s more rewarding to watch as an audience. It feels sincere and heartfelt.\"\n\nIn a review for Autostraddle, Editor Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya praised the central relationship in the show stating, “It’s a series that surprised me and not in the expected avenues of plot twists but rather in its humor and its characters and relationship dynamics. Vivian and Jamie make for one of the best queer friendships I’ve seen on television in a while”.\n\nIn a mixed three-star review, Rachel Sigee of iNews praised the \"refreshing\" queer representation but criticised the show's merging of comedy and horror, stating that \"with its original premise, game approach to genre-bending and admirable sense of silliness, Wreck certainly stands out, if not always for the right reasons.\"\n\nAmong more negative reviews from critics, the series received two stars from The Times, The Evening Standard and the Daily Mail'', who said \"there’s not a great deal to recommend this barking mad drama, which is a cross between a high-school comedy movie and a slasher flick with the killer being Orville the Duck,\" and described it as “more convoluted with each episode, taking viewers from one daft plot to another like a marble in a pinball machine” and “This camp horror thriller is a bit confused about its identity.\"\n Brown hit back at the negative reviews, stating on his Twitter, \"Nearly all of the “critics” only watched the first episode and have no idea what the show is about.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n\nEnglish-language television shows\n2022 British television series debuts\n2020s British horror television series\n2020s British LGBT-related comedy television series\nBBC television comedy\nGay-related television shows\nBritish horror comedy television series\nLGBT speculative fiction television series\nTelevision shows filmed in Northern Ireland\nTelevision series about teenagers\nTelevision series by Euston Films\nTelevision series set on cruise ships\n2020s British mystery television series", "unikey": "Wreck (TV series)", "summary": "Wreck (originally titled Wrecked) is a British comedy horror television series, created and written by Ryan J.

comedywhen jamies sister goes missing on a cruise ship he goes undercover to find out what happened only to be confronted by a murderous duckjack rowan as danny and quacky photo peter marleybbceuston filmsby rachael sigeeoctober 7 2022 1045 pmmany would argue that being on a cruise ship for any length of time sounds like a nightmare but in bbc threes wreck its quite literally a horror show aboard the ms sacramentum even worse than the forced fun of bingo nights cher tribute act and piratethemed bars is the fact that a serial killer dressed as a giant duck is running wild offing crew membersthe sixpart horrorcomedy from creator ryan j brown follows jamie oscar kennedy who has bribed his way on board in order to find out what happened to his sister pippa jodie tyack who disappeared mysteriously three months agoalthough the cruise operator found that she jumped overboard the suitably creepy opening sequence shows that there was more to it with pippa being harassed by her exboyfriend danny jack rowan before the murderous duck chased her from the top deck and so while jamie believes hes there to uncover a corporate coverup at sea he must have been watching succession posing as cormac he soon finds himself tangled up in something even darkerat complete odds with his mission is the debauched existence of the ships young crew  a life one character describes as a neverending freshers weekhazing rituals allnight parties and all the booze they can get their hands on isnt exactly the ideal set of circumstances for conducting an undercover investigation without being exposed as a fraud further encumbered by the inconvenience of the real cormac having also stowed away in his cabin jamie quickly enlists fellow staffer vivian a charming thaddea graham to help him get to the bottom of whats really going onas any vigil fans will know a big old ship is a great setting for a mystery and wreck leans into the inbuilt absurdity of cruise ships the upstairsdownstairs divide the shacklesoff holiday revelry and the strict hierarchy of being at sea although wreck cheerfully embraces classic slasher movie tropes it also borrows heavily from high school movies  another setting where a delicate and independent social ecosystem operates on the sacramentum for example the authority figure is the tyrannical karen harriet webb who rules with an iron fist and wont give you the morning off even if your shift began with the discovery of a dead bodymurderous duck quacky photo peter marleybbceuston filmsmeanwhile the popular clique are the performers currently both running a covert drugdealing ring and rehearsing their new show apocalypse wow wow wow there should perhaps be more of that kind of throwaway gag in wreck a comedyhorror hybrid that often struggles to pack a significant enough punch on both the humour and scary stuffthat said horrorcomedy is a tricky balance and there are still enjoyable moments its mockery of the glossy corporate schtick of the cruise company at least one properly gruesome death and the silent predatory duck which is both ludicrous and genuinely unnerving there is also the refreshing factor of two queer lead characters who talk about their sexuality without it being the sole source of their trauma or character developmentwith its original premise game approach to genrebending and admirable sense of silliness wreck certainly stands out if not always for the right reasons nevertheless this is exactly the kind of telly that bbc three should be making ambitious audacious and if not always

telly that bbc3 should be making ambitious audacious and if not always entirely perfect then bold enough in its convictionsrachel sigee the i its all fine wreck has got charm its got a little bit of wit its got youthful exuberance and energy and even if it never develops much more than that it will justify its place in the schedules its fun perhaps rather than notably funny but sometimes thats enoughlucy mangan the guardian theres not a great deal to recommend this barking mad drama which is a cross between a highschool comedy movie and a slasher flick with the killer being orville the duck to be fair there were some funny lines and a kinky initiation ceremony for new crew members that involved a large dead fish id guess it needs more funny characters and a more intriguing mystery to make most people last the full stretch but if you want silly escapism its herecarol midgley the times it stars young actors its about young people being youthful and its chock full of heightened characters and antics theres so much colour and energy and hormones on screen that it makes you okay me feel superannuated just watching it inevitably therefore there are misfires  im not sure we needed another shady multinational corporation who here are operating the good ship sacramentum just as we didnt need another girl diving into a pool but like a punk band at their first gig wrecks energy is infectiousbenji wilson the telegraph this camp horror thriller is a bit confused about its identity most of the time it wants to be a soap mystery with lots of partying and romances among the young crew now and then it becomes a fluffier blair witch project with a serial killer in a fancydress duck costume stalking the cabins and at odd moments it turns supernatural as the ghost of drowned entertainer pippa jodie tyack materialises to stare at her brother jamie oscar kennedy as he tries to find out the truth about how she died the result is a tangle of comedy snogging and gorechristopher stevens daily mail raising the mary rose the lost tapes channel 4 the programme consisted largely of footage of the main players in the salvage operation being filmed watching the archive footage like a sort of salty seadog gogglebox i wouldnt for a minute want to suggest that the history of the mary rose nor the gaunt hull itself that was lifted from the sea bed nor the operation to do that lifting was boring but the whole lost tapes setup which was the reason given for the programmes existence at all was a red herring it proved only that some unseen archive footage is in fact unseen for a reasonbenji wilson the telegraph karen pirie itv i thought the karen pirie finale was terrific lauren lyle has been perfectly cast in this role despite looking about 12 years old she has an open face that manages to be aloof and expressive at the same time and this has been an admirably contained performance in a story about how one selfish man had wrecked many lives and how sexism still prevails in the police it managed to make strong feminist points without ramming them down the viewers throatcarol midgley the times topicscritics no comments related articles critics
