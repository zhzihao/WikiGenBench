{"id": 75111353, "key": "Cyclone Tej", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone%20Tej", "text": "Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Tej was a strong tropical cyclone that formed over the central-south Arabian Sea and made landfall on Yemen. It was the first cyclone to make landfall in the nation since Cyclone Luban of 2018. The sixth depression and the third named cyclonic storm of the season, Tej coexisted with Cyclone Hamoon in the Bay of Bengal, a rare phenomenon not seen since 2018. The cyclone then took a northwestward track in the Arabian Sea and made landfall in Al Mahrah Governorate of Yemen between 23 and , bringing significant rainfall and flooding across the eastern half of the country and western parts of Oman.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nOn October 16, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring potential for the formation of a cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea. In Arabian Sea, relatively high ocean temperatures, indicating a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, created favourable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis. A cyclonic circulation formed over the Arabian Sea on the 16th October. A low-pressure area formed as a result of the cyclonic circulation on the morning of October 18th. It intensified further on October 20, becoming a deep depression. On the same day, the system intensified into a Cyclonic Storm, receiving the name Tej.\n\nPreparations\n\nOman\nOman's Salalah port was planned to be temporarily shut from October 22, in response to Tej's expected arrival.\n\nThe Oman News Agency reported the country's authorities' decision to grant a holiday to employees in the public and private sectors, in the Dhofar Governorate, and the Al Jazir Wilayat in the Al Wusta Governorate, due to the expected effects of Cyclone Tej.\n\nOman's National Committee for Emergency Situations Management evacuated residents from the Hallaniyat Islands and coastal regions in the states of Salalah, Rakhyut and Dhalkot. Shelters and accommodation for 15,000 people were prepared in the Dhofar Governorate.\n\nFlights between Muscat and Salalah airports were increased to facilitate movement during the cyclone.\n\nYemen \nThe Yemeni Coast Guard in the Hadhramaut Governorate announced that it was taking precautionary measures in anticipation of the arrival of Tej. In Shabwah Governorate, fishermen were warned not to go into the sea and were told to take necessary precautions. In Al Mahrah Governorate, The Office of Education in Al-Mahra also announced the closure of schools in the governorate due to Tej. President Rashid al-Alimi contacted the governorates of Hadhramout, Mahra, and Socotra and directed the government to support the efforts of the local authorities in preparing for the arrival of Tej. Authorities in eastern Yemen declared a state of emergency, suspended schools and told fishermen stay home. The warning also prompted Yemeni authorities in Hadramout, Mahra, Shabwa and Socotra to declare a state of emergency and issue regular updates to the public. Fishermen were ordered not to go to sea and were also told to empty their docked boats and move the vessels to safer locations, and people living in low-lying areas advised to move their cars and other possessions to safety. Hadramout Governor Mabkhout bin Madhi set up a committee to oversee preparations for rescue and storm relief operations, while the neighbouring governorate of Al Mahrah, set up an emergency committee to make plans for schools to house people forced to leave their homes in the event of severe damage from the cyclone.\n\nImpact\n\nOman\nCyclone Tej struck Oman's Dhofar Governorate, with the National Multi-Hazards Early Warning Centre indicating an intensification of the cyclone. Expect heavy to very heavy rainfall (100-300 mm), leading to flooding in valleys and high waves (6-12 meters) on the Arabian Sea coast. The cyclone featured wind speeds around its centre of 95-110 knots. It came ashore near the coast of Dhofar on the evening of 23rd October and the following morning, bringing heavy rain, strong winds (50-70 knots), and rough seas.\n\nTropical rain clouds affected Dhofar Governorate, bringing varying levels of rainfall to Salalah, Sadah, Mirbat, and Taqah. Additionally, rough seas with waves ranging from 6 to 12 meters were expected along the Arabian Sea coast, posing a danger to coastal areas and creeks.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\nHeavy rains hit parts of the UAE on October 22. Massive flooding was reported in an area south of Shawka, which is a town near the Oman border.\n\nOn October 25, flooding occurred in the Al Faya region in Sharjah, which is located towards the east of UAE. Hailstones fell in an area north of Fujairah with mountainous roads flooded with rainwater.\n\nYemen\n\nSocotra \n\nOn October 22, Tej caused rough weather and torrential rains in Socotra, along with reported high waves, floods and landslides. Torrential rain on Saturday caused flooding on the island of Socotra as the cyclone made landfall. The flooding led to some roads in the governorate's capital city of Hadibu being cut, along with other areas in the archipelago. The Socotra Airport recorded  of rain, with wind speeds reaching  and gusts exceeding .\n\nThere was damage as a result of rain and wind, related to the blocking of roads and the bulldozing of farms, and the destruction of parts of some homes. Over 500 homes on the island sustained damage from the cyclone, displacing 192 households, primarily in Qulensya wa Abd al Kuri District. Three people overall were reported with minor injuries.\n\nMainland\n\nThe Yemen Red Crescent Society in Al-Mahra Governorate initiated evacuations due to Cyclone Tej, along with the army, security forces, and health teams to move affected families to shelter centers amidst heavy rain and strong winds. Additionally, they also appealed to the Presidential Council, government, and Arab coalition for aircraft assistance to rescue flood-stranded individuals in Al-Ghaydah District, including Al-Ibri, Haft Al-Sada, Kalshat, and other areas. \n\nThe storm flooded roads, submerged cars and forced Yemen Red Crescent volunteers in Al Mahra to temporarily suspend operations. The cyclone resulted in the death of at least two people. Along with this, 150 injuries were reported, and 10,000 people were displaced.\n\nSee also \n\n Weather of 2023\n Tropical cyclones in 2023\n Deep Depression ARB 02 (2008)\n Cyclone Chapala (2015)\n Cyclone Megh (2015)\n Cyclone Mekunu (2018)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2023 in Oman\n2023 in Saudi Arabia\n2023 in Yemen\n2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season\nOctober 2023 events in Asia\nTropical cyclones in Oman\nTropical cyclones in Saudi Arabia\nTropical cyclones in Yemen", "unikey": "Cyclone Tej", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Meteorological_history", "Preparations", "Impact", "See_also", "Notes", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["On 16 October 2023, theIndia Meteorological Department(IMD) began monitoring for the formation of acycloniccirculationin theArabian Sea.In the Arabian Sea, relatively highocean temperatures, indicating a positiveIndian Ocean Dipole, created favourable conditions fortropical cyclogenesis.A cyclonic circulation formed over the Arabian Sea on 16 October.Alow-pressure areaformed as a result of the cyclonic circulation on the morning of October 18th.
