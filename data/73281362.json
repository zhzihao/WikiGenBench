It was published in German in 2014 and translated into English by John Brownjohn in 2018. It was the first of Giordano's novels to be translated into English. Set in Sicily, the topics of the Sicilian Mafia and Italian police forces are presented.\n\nSummary \n\nIsolde Oberreiter, known in the story as Auntie Poldi, is a Bavarian widow who retires to Sicily on her 60th birthday with an intention of drinking the rest of her days away at her seaside house. When Poldi's handyman Valentino Candela fails to show up to her home one day, Poldi becomes concerned, and begins to inquire into his whereabouts. During her search, Poldi speaks to Valentino's parents, who inform her that Valentino used to work for a man named Russo near the estate of Femminamorta.\n\nPoldi travels to Femminamorta to investigate, where she meets Valerie, the house's owner and sole resident. Valerie reveals that Russo, a mafia leader, is pressuring her into selling the land. She believes that he is behind the theft of one of the lion guardants at her house. Unable to speak to Russo at his house, Poldi is subsequently invited to Valerie's uncle Mimi's party because Russo will also be there. Poldi's plan to interrogate Russo is foiled by Mimi's incessant discussion of Friedrich Hölderlin's poetry.\n\nTwo days later, Poldi discovers Valentino's body at the beach. She calls the two police entities, causing confusion about jurisdiction. Chief inspector Vito Montana later arrives at the scene as a leader of the police investigating Valentino's murder and questions Poldi. After questioning Poldi and advising her to stay out of the case, Montana lets her go.\n\nDespite Montana's instructions, Poldi continues to involve herself in the case through her own investigation. Throughout her investigations, she continues to get closer to Montana through professional, personal, and sexual interactions.\n\nIt is later discovered that Valerie's missing lion guardant was placed inside Poldi's house. Inside it, she found an inventory of prices. Poldi later learned that the inventory was for items looted from houses belonging to Mimi.\n\nPoldi finds out there is more than one Femminamorta in Italy, meaning that Valerie's house may not have been the correct location of the crime. Poldi links the yellow crystal she found in Valentino's room to a sulfur crystal. There is a sulfur mine called Femminamorta, so they go investigate it and find a dead body dumped in an old iron cistern and locked with a brand-new padlock. Montana reveals that Valentino's blood was found in the boot of a vehicle whose tire tracks were found by the mine.\n\nSignora Cocuzza, a worker at the town's gelateria (a shop that sells gelato), goes to Poldi's house and reveals that she knows who the body in the cistern was. Her name was Marisa and she made a man who wrote her love letters jealous by falling for someone else. Marisa died after confronting this man. Signora Cocuzza leads Poldi to the virgin Mary statue where Marisa and the man exchanged love letters. Poldi discovers poetry in the imitation of Hölderlin, which leads her to suspect Mimi not only as Marisa's murderer but also Valentino's.\n\nAt Poldi's house, Mimi realizes Poldi identified him as the murderer and sends his dog to attack Poldi. He reveals his motives by saying Valentino was blackmailing him about the letters and would not stop. Montana then arrives and shoots Mimi's dog. Mimi dies of heart failure shortly after.\n\nThe story ends with Montana, who had to choose between Poldi and his current girlfriend, later showing up at Poldi's house and being warmly welcomed inside.\n\nInspiration \nIn interviews, Giordano spoke about the pieces of his own life that led him to create the character of Auntie Poldi. Giordano had people in his life that were his inspiration for Auntie Poldi, Teresa, Caterina, and Luisa. While he does not mention his aunt by name, Giordano does say that he has a Bavarian aunt who moved to Sicily with similar goals to Auntie Poldi. Giordano also said that the narrator of the novel, an aspiring novelist without a life plan, is inspired by himself at a young age. Giordano was even writing a family saga similar to the one that the narrator attempts to write throughout the novel.\n\nGiordano was born in Munich, Germany. His parents are both of Italian descent. Most of his career was focused on writing, as he wrote novels and screenplays. Much of his work has been awarded. This novel, inspired by his family and life, is his first novel to be translated into English from its original language of German. His time attending primary school in Bavaria influenced his use of Bavarian language in his novel. Giordano said he specifically loves the roughness of the Bavarian dialect, which he feels suits Auntie Poldi as a character.\n\nIssues in Italian culture \n\nThis story is set in the town of Torre Archirafi in Sicily. It is a small, ocean-front town that also has sulfur mines. The Italian setting of the book allowed Giordano to include many aspects of Italian culture in his book. Italian culture is described as an ideal setting because of the social issues of government corruption and the presence of the mafia which are prominent in Italian society.\n\nMafia \nThe Sicilian Mafia is a major part of Sicilian culture. The mafia was prevalent throughout Sicilian society and left an impact on its residents. For example, Italian crime writer Leonardo Sciascia's writings were inspired by his upbringing in mafia-ridden Sicily.\n\nIn Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions, a member of the mafia is the first major suspect of Valentino's murder.\n\nThe Mafia has been a major part of Sicilian Culture since the 19th century. It originally started as a way to identify those who were suspicious of the government. Currently, the Mafia's strength in culture has been weakened. Its primary activity includes protecting those who pay for protection, which often includes criminals.\n\nPolice jurisdiction \nWhen Poldi finds Valentino's body, she accidentally calls the Carabinieri instead of the Polizia di Stato (state police). She ends up calling both after noticing her mistake, causing a confusion on police jurisdiction that resulted in Vito Montana, a chief inspector associated with the state police, heading both police departments on the case.  \n\nBoth the Carabinieri and the Polizia di Stato are headquartered in Rome, but have stations all throughout Italy. The Carabinieri, associated with the Ministry of Defense, primarily handles financial crimes. In contrast, the Polizia di Stato handles investigation and arrests of criminals associated with human crimes such as murder. Located in each city, members of the Polizia di Stato also act as rangers, traffic police, and coast guards. Valentino's murder, according to police jurisdiction, officially belongs to the Polizia di Sato.\n\nReception \nThe book garnered a generally positive reception. For example, the Lisle Library District located in Illinois hosted a book club which reviewed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions. In their discussion, they determined that the book is \"a great armchair travel experience\" and \"eccentric and appealing\". \n\nThere are also plans for a British production company to create a TV series following the events of the Aunt Poldi series.\n\nReferences \n\nDetective fiction\nItalian fiction\nSeries of books\nAlcohol abuse\nTranslated pages\nMafia\nSicily\nFiction", "unikey": "Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions", "summary": "Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions is the first of four books written by Mario Giordano in the Auntie Poldi Adventure Series.

his aunti poldi mystery series set in sicily and the real life inspiration for the serieshis bavarian aunt is there a real auntie poldi yes i had this bavarian aunt and she moved to sicily in order to drink herself to death which she managed to do she never expressed it openly but it was quite obvious that she had that plan she was a very funny and glamorous and dramatic woman we all loved her but she was very melancholy too so there was a blueprint so to say did she inspire you to write a mystery well it was a little bit like the nephew in auntie poldi attempting to write this big big family saga for many years i had the same idea three generationssicily germany immigration history whatever i never came to grips until i realized why the reasons were quite simple i didnt have a real story no protagonist no narrative perspective so i thought lets try with a genre i am familiar with which is mystery and crime fiction then i had this idea to make it funny then i remembered my aunt poldi at that moment everything fell together i immediately knew i would write a funny mystery with auntie poldi as a protagonist and myself as a clumsy nerdy narrator and thats it do you have aunts like the characters teresa caterina luisa an uncle martino of course i had to ask them very seriously before i was writing the first book because immediately they said okay no worries you can write about us i said no no no no no take your time sleep on it and then give me an answer because i dont want you to complain when the novel is done so they said okay mario you can write about us just change the names and we are fine they really liked it and since they grew up in germany they can read the german editions sicilians find it a cinch to emigrate to germany for decades bag packed bacio addioand off they go why germany well its not only germany of course sicilians have always emigrated to austria to switzerland to wherever in europe and even of course to the us but germany has always been a major destination because as machiavelli said the neighbor of your neighbor is your friend italians do have a very romantic relationship with germany and vice versa and its not that far away it was always possible to go back to sicily on summer vacations i am german and this is the story of my familythey immigrated here in the early 20th century and then went back in the 1960s do you work with your translators in this case no i was in touch with the translator later sometimes he had questions so we had a little email exchange i usually dont have much contact with a translator it was a bit different with the italian translation because i commissioned the translation to make it a present to the nongermanspeaking part of my family then an italian publishing house bought this translation and since my italian translator was living in berlin we were in touch all the time its interesting to see how they struggle and which solutions they come up with one of the things i like about the english version is that the translator left in not just the usual familiar italian words and phrases but more like forza bella figura che schifo i think that translators should have enough freedom to decide on their own how they work its never a good idea for me as a writer to recommend some stuff if its a good translator they always have a feeling for what is best i really like the idea that the translator left a few italian words and phrases here and there even in the german original there are some italian expressions which add atmosphere to the whole will there be another auntie poldi book yes the second in the series is auntie poldi and the vineyards of etna  last week i decided to immediately finish a screenplay and then i will start working on the fourth poldi i originally had the plan to write a very different novel in between just for a change but it was so much fun i really wanted to write another one i always have said that i have enough material and ideas for six but i think six would be enough i never wanted to write a series for the rest of my life you have to know when to stop thats clear because in a series at some point you have narrated all about the mystery of the character and then everyone knows everything about the character then the series is done there is no engine for continuation as long as i can give the character a little secret and interesting parts to discover then im fine will you keep teasing us with whats under poldis infamous wig in the third volume the nephew will get a little glimpse of what is probably under the wig but hes not sure and he wouldnt ever talk about it good i dont want to know exactly its a ridiculous secret but i really like it this interview by marilyn dahl first ran in shelf awareness and is reproduced with
