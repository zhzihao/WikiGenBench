{"id": 74781281, "key": "Rex v Bourne", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex%20v%20Bourne", "text": "Rex v Bourne, The King v Aleck Bourne, or the Bourne Judgement, was a British landmark court case in 1938 relating to an abortion performed by obstetric surgeon Aleck Bourne on a 14-year-old girl who had become pregnant as a result of being raped. The judge directed the jury towards the concept that situations arise where abortion might protect the health of the mother. Bourne was found not guilty of performing the procedure unlawfully and the judgement set the precedence for several subsequent abortion cases and the Abortion Act 1967 (UK).\n\nSeeking a termination of her pregnancy in May 1938, the girl came to the attention of Bourne, who had been awaiting such a case to test in the courts. He admitted her to St Mary's Hospital in June, informed authorities of his intention to perform the operation, carried it out, and then asked to be arrested. \n\nCharged under section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for procuring an abortion, it was decided that the case should go to trial at the Old Bailey before a judge and jury. With the term \"unlawful\" added to the charge, the trial took place on 18 and 19 July 1938. The prosecution was led by Donald Sumervell, while Bourne was defended by Mr G. A. Thesiger and Roland Oliver. In his direction, the judge Sir Malcolm Macnaghten, asked the jury to answer not the question of whether Bourne performed the operation in good faith to preserve the girl's life, but whether Bourne's actions were \"not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the girl.\" It took the jury 40-minutes to come to the verdict that Bourne was not guilty.\n\nThe trial received widespread interest from the public, medical professionals and legal establishments.\n\nBackground\nThe Offences Against the Person Act 1861 made it illegal to perform an abortion. Between 1861 and 1938, some therapeutic indications for terminating a pregnancy were found in medical textbooks, though where that stood in law was unclear; the issue of what might be a lawful reason to perform an abortion had not been tested in court. By 1920, the procedure was generally safe when performed by trained professionals. However, prosecutions for conducting abortions were common, particularly of medically untrained women who carried out the unsafe procedure for a small fee. \n\nAleck Bourne was a reputable obstetrician at St Mary's Hospital, London, and visiting consultant at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, London, who pushed for reforms in abortion law, and performed the procedure without fee. Five years before the 1938 trial, Bourne had successfully stood by a Dr Avarne, who had been accused by pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury of performing an illegal abortion. The following year in 1934 he was appointed to the British Medical Association  Committee on the Medical Aspects of Abortion. Its report, published in 1936, included indications for performing an abortion for therapeutic reasons, one of which was for mental ill-health. It noted that an abortion might prevent psychological stress in an underage girl pregnant by rape. Subsequently, for the purpose of testing the issue in court, Bourne awaited such a case to come his way.\n\nFacts\nOn 27 April 1938, a 14-year-old girl had been raped by a group of Royal guardsmen at Horse Guards Parade near Whitehall and the assailants were subsequently sentenced at the Old Bailey.\n\nIn May 1938, the girl attended St Thomas' Hospital, where after confirming that she was pregnant, was refused an abortion and was turned away. Through the Schools Care Committee, the girl came to the attention of Joan Malleson, a physician and member of the medico-legal counsel of the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA). Malleson in turn wrote to Bourne for assistance.\n\nBourne saw the girl and her mother on 31 May. She was admitted to St Mary's on 6 June. On 14 June, he openly performed a termination of pregnancy. He had informed the police of his intent prior to the procedure, and afterwards asked to be arrested. Subsequently he was charged under section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.\n\nMarylebone Police Court\n\nOn 1 July, Bourne was called to Marylebone Police Court, where in front of magistrate Mr Ivan E. Snell, Mr G. A. Thesiger of the London and Counties Medical Protection Society took to his defence. The Director of Public Prosecutions was represented by H. A. K. Morgan.\n\nProsecution\nMorgan noted the case to be far from usual in that a well respected surgeon openly broke the law for reasons he thought good, and in so doing risked his own life imprisonment. On finding an underage girl pregnant by rape, Bourne had found his perfect case. Morgan clarified that on missing her period the girl was taken to Malleson. Malleson requested advice from Bourne, who in turn replied \"I shall be delighted to take her in at St Mary's and curette her. ... I will write to the attorney general and invite him to take action\". After seeing the girl and receiving a letter of consent from the father, Bourne informed Dr P. C. F. Wingate, his obstetric officer, about the case. At admission, a pregnancy test was positive and she was observed until the eighth day when Bourne noted her to have a nervous breakdown. It was then that Bourne confirmed to go ahead with the procedure to \"empty her uterus\", and this was carried out on 14 June. Later that day, when Chief inspector Bridger went to interview him, Bourne responded by saying \"I want you to arrest me.\"\n\nThe girl's name was not revealed in court and Morgan assured the court that she would face no charges herself. Her father confirmed that he gave written consent to Bourne on 31 May, but asked to keep it a private matter. Malleson confirmed she knew Bourne in a professional manner and that she received two letters from him in response to hers. Also cautioned was Wingate. He confirmed the story, adding that he attended the abortion on 14 June, which was carried out under aseptic conditions and that she had been looked after by qualified medical staff.\n\nDefence\nThesiger advised Bourne to plead \"not guilty\". He informed the court of how the law stood on the matter of abortion, and reiterated the crime against the girl; one man had sexual intercourse with her while the other held her down. Thesiger clarified that the girl and her parents consented to the abortion, the surgeon was highly qualified and the conditions for the procedure was as safe as could be. Thesiger argued that Bourne attempted to avert the consequences of a wrong doing and could not possibly be unlawful in his actions. He pointed out that the 1861 Act mentioned the word \"unlawful\" four times, an unnecessary entry unless the law intended that there may be situations where the procedure would not be \"unlawful\". He called for the case to be dismissed.\n\nMagistrate's decision\nThe conclusion was that Bourne was to pay £100 in bail and go to trial at the Central Criminal Court before a judge and jury. Snell pointed out that this decision was likely agreeable with Bourne himself.\n\nProceedings in the Old Bailey\n\nBourne was \"charged under the Offences against the Person Act 1861, s. 58, that he unlawfully procured the abortion of a girl aged about 15 years\". The trial took place at the Old Bailey on 18 and 19 July 1938. \n\nTwo women and 10 men made up the jury. The judge was Sir Malcolm Macnaghten. Attorney General Donald Sumervell, L. A. Byrne and Henry Elam represented the prosecution, while Bourne was defended by Thesiger and Roland Oliver.  \n\nOliver began with explaining that the case depended on the meaning of \"unlawful\" and with agreement of the judge and prosecution, asked that if any members of the jury had strong opinions that all abortions were unlawful then they should step down; none did.\n\nProsecution\nMalleson wrote to Bourne that the response of the consultant at St Thomas’s was that, \"the rapists were officers and therefore apparently gentlemen\".\n\nBourne admitted that his experience of seeing the dangers of underage girls going through pregnancy did bias his opinion in this case, though it was performed in what was the agreed safest conditions at that time. He felt that though he felt certain himself of what was meant by \"therapeutic\", he acknowledged that fears among his colleagues of performing abortions for therapeutic reasons resulted in many women resorting to dangerous backstreet procedures. His intent was to observe her over a period of time. Bourne noted that the girl was \"not mentally defective\" and \"not of the prostitute type\". Unable to differentiate between danger to life and danger to health, Bourne felt abortion was justified to protect both her physical and mental health. Bourne clarified that he performed the operation to save health and preserve life, not to save life.\n\nDefence\nWitnesses included Lord Horder. He agreed with Bourne. William Gilliatt, an eminant gynaecologist assured the court of Bourne's competence in both deciding on a suitable case and performing the operation, and if put in similar situation he would have done the same.\n\nIn the evidence of police surgeon, Jacob A. Gorsky, his examination findings from 27 April found the girl distressed with physical signs consistent with \"violence and rape\". The opinion of psychiatrist, J. R. Rees, was that the state of the mind was intertwined with the physical state, and if asked if he would advise abortion in this girl's case, he said he would certainly agree on the grounds of the severity of the sexual assault and her young age. The outcome of leaving her as she was would be similar to that of shell shock, he told the court.\n\nDirection and verdict\n\nMacnaghten asked the jury to answer not the question of whether Bourne performed the operation in good faith to preserve the girl's life, but whether Bourne's actions were \"not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the girl.\" He recognised that performing an abortion might protect the health of the mother by preventing a \"physical or mental wreck\". \n\nMcNaughton drew upon the wording of the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 and whether the procedure is \"done in good faith for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother\". He recommended that the jury be prejudiced by the testimonies of Gorsky and Rees, and consider the girl's age, dangers of delivering a baby before physical maturity, and mental effect of the crime of rape of a child. He reminded them that this case involved a girl not of \"the prostitute class\". He used the analogy of not immediately operating on a child with appendicitis to save life, contrast to be watchful waiting and operating with risk of death once the appendix perforates. \"Do it, and do it now. Do it while it is still safe to do it. Do not wait to see whether she is near death.\" \"The unborn child in the womb must not be destroyed unless the destruction of that child is for the purpose of preserving the yet more precious life of the mother\", he said. \n\nIt took the jury 40 minutes to come to the verdict of \"Not Guilty\".\n\nResponse\nDubbed \" the case of the horse with a green tail\", the assault on the girl in April 1938 received widespread media coverage in England. Subsequently, the trial relating to the abortion received extensive interest from the public, medical professionals and legal establishments. On hearing the verdict, members at a BMA conference cheered at the news. \n\nThe judgement gave physicians the authority to decide on the legibility of a woman requesting an abortion. However, illegal backstreet abortions continued for most seeking a termination of pregnancy unless a safer private clinic could be afforded. The case had come to be known as the \"Bourne Judgement\" and set the precedence in several subsequent abortion cases. \n\nIn 1945, Bourne resigned from the ALRA and co-founded the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children. To Bourne's disappointment the case was used in the construction of the Abortion Act of 1967, which he criticized for being lax, saying that \"I would not have it believed that I have worked for a loose interpretation of the law\", and in his opinion would result in \"the greatest holocaust in history\". The Abortion Act 1967 recognised abortion as legal if two registered medical practitioners agreed that \"the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, or any existing children of her family\".\n\nSee also\nR v Davidson\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nMedical case law\nUnited Kingdom health case law\n1938 in England\nAbortion case law\nAbortion debate", "unikey": "Rex v Bourne", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Facts", "Marylebone_Police_Court", "Proceedings_in_the_Old_Bailey", "Response", "See_also", "Notes", "References", "Further_reading"], "contents": ["TheOffences Against the Person Act 1861made it illegal to perform anabortion.[a]Between 1861 and 1938, some therapeutic indications for terminating a pregnancy were found in medical textbooks, though where that stood in law was unclear; the issue of what might be a lawful reason to perform an abortion had not been tested in court.By 1920, the procedure was generally safe when performed by trained professionals.However, prosecutions for conducting abortions were common, particularly of medically untrained women who carried out theunsafe procedurefor a small fee.\nAleck Bournewas a reputable obstetrician atSt Mary's Hospital, London, and visiting consultant atQueen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, London, who pushed for reforms inabortion law, and performed the procedure without fee.Five years before the 1938 trial, Bourne had successfully stood by a Dr Avarne, who had been accused by pathologistSir Bernard Spilsburyof performing an illegal abortion.The following year in 1934 he was appointed to theBritish Medical Association(BMA) Committee on the Medical Aspects of Abortion.Its report, published in 1936, included indications for performing an abortion for therapeutic reasons, one of which was formental ill-health.It noted that an abortion might preventpsychological stressin anunderagegirl pregnant by rape.Subsequently, for the purpose of testing the issue in court, Bourne awaited such a case to come his way.\n", "On 27 April 1938, a 14-year-old girl had beenrapedby a group of Royal guardsmen atHorse Guards ParadenearWhitehalland the assailants were subsequently sentenced at theOld Bailey.[b]\nIn May 1938, the girl attendedSt Thomas' Hospital, where after confirming that she was pregnant, was refused an abortion and was turned away.Through the Schools Care Committee, the girl came to the attention ofJoan Malleson, a physician and member of the medico-legal counsel of theAbortion Law Reform Association(ALRA).Malleson in turn wrote to Bourne for assistance.\nBourne saw the girl and her mother on 31 May.She was admitted to St Mary's on 6 June.On 14 June, he openly performed a termination of pregnancy.He had informed the police of his intent prior to the procedure, and afterwards asked to be arrested.Subsequently he was charged under section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861.\n", "On 1 July, Bourne was called toMarylebone Police Court, where in front of magistrate Mr Ivan E.

therapeutic medical procedure the battle over abortion rights has been as large in england as in the us however the battle ground has been parliament rather than the courts as in the us the reason for this stems mainly from the sovereignty of the parliament which makes the english courts weaker than the us courts which can actually overturn legislation in the beginning fetal rights were seen as absolute currently the rights of women to control their own bodies has been balanced against fetal rights now with some restriction and government regulation women can seek abortion there are still a great deal of unanswered questions concerning abortion the legality of ru486 and iuds as well as selective reduction are still unresolved issues further the effects of the united kingdoms union with europe and the change to english law that will result are still unknown already an english abortion case has been brought before the european commission of human rights the body that screens cases for the european court of human rights the case was rejected because the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has several articles which seem to apply to a womans right to bodily integrity family determination and physician and mental health however article 2 provides that everyones right to life shall be protected the commission ruled that this article applies to living people and thus not to fetuses after european unification if completed the issue of abortion law in england will surely be settle by european courts pubmed disclaimer similar

tend to vary more across countries than within them this article proposes a politicalinstitutional theory of medicalization in which health care policy legacies political decentralization and constitutionalism shape the preferences discourses strategies and influence of actors that seek or resist medicalization the theory helps explain why abortion has been more medicalized in britain than the united states the analysis finds that the american medical profession unlike its british counterpart focused on defending private medicine rather than protecting its power to diagnose the medical necessity of abortions that american political decentralization aided the establishment of abortion on request by encouraging strategic innovation and learning that shaped social movement strategies medical issue avoidance and the growth of nonhospital clinics and finally that constitutionalism promoted rights discourses that partially crowded out medical ones keywords abortion medical profession

guardsmen at wellington barracks in west london she became pregnant as a result the first doctor asked to terminate the pregnancy was a roman catholic who refused the second doctor aleck bourne admitted the girl to st marys hospital paddington to carry out the operation english law at the time outlawed abortion unless it was necessary to preserve the life of the mother dr bourne informed the police of his intentions prior to the termination and was subsequently charged with a criminal offence the hard case the case attracted much media sympathy dr bourne became something of a public hero for challenging the law and risking his career for the sake of a young girl he was acquitted by the jury under clear direction from the judge the ruling redefined the boundaries of abortion law and laid the ground for the 1967 abortion act bourne went to the authorities to establish the legality of the operation he had performed he was not a strong advocate of abortion but he believed it was the compassionate response in certain situations he had sat on the british medical associations bma 1935 committee on abortion and was a member of the medicolegal committee of the abortion law reform association alra  the campaign group founded in 1936 to liberalise abortion legislation bourne was later alarmed by the effect of his case on english law he resigned from the alra in 1945 and became a founding member of the society for the protection of unborn children spuc he was strongly opposed to the 1967 abortion act and predicted that it would lead to the greatest holocaust in history this article examines the steps that led from r v bourne to the 1967 abortion act and beyond in the hope that we can learn something useful from what is past rewriting law in r v bourne mr justice macnaghten brought the oap and ilp acts together see box and read the preservation of the life of the mother clause back into the oap act so that it covered all abortion procedures he then made a wide interpretation of that clause in his directions to the jury it is not contended that those words mean merely for the purpose of saving the mother from instant deathi think those words ought to be construed in a reasonable sense and if the doctor is of opinionthat the probable consequence of the continuance of the pregnancy will be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck is operating for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother case law law defined by court cases as opposed to parliamentary statute often seems to be led by pragmatism  a desire for the best outcome a judge may interpret the law in a new way to allow for the situation before him this is particularly relevant in a case such as bournes where public sympathy was in his favour and the law seemed out of date the new interpretation sets a precedent against which future cases can be measured following bourne any doctor could act the same way under sufficiently similar circumstances without fearing criminalisation hard cases and bad law there is an old adage that hard cases make bad law yet it is often the hard cases that drive law reform in many ways this is unavoidable as hard cases inherently raise questions about the current law and are effective in proving a point lobbying bodies such as the alra support difficult cases firstly because they believe the case is unjust and secondly because they can use the case to prove that the law is unfair out of date and needs to change this kind of campaigning has been seen more recently with the voluntary euthanasia societys ves support of diane pretty before prolifers use the hard cases make bad law saying as a criticism we should look at the arguments used by our side using hard cases is a common method of fighting causes on both sides recent coverage of late abortion and abortion for fetal abnormality has been effective in questioning the limits of the current law however with any hard case we should consider the various solutions to the problem and recognise that democratic consensus may be impossible to achieve the alra the alra was founded in 1936 by a group of women seeking to repeal the present abortion law and substitute one freeing the medical profession from all legal restrictions except those required by medical or humanitarian considerations although r v bourne was a triumph for them abortion was still not widely available they continued campaigning but the second world war and associated population decline meant their cause was not a political priority throughout the 1950s the press became increasingly sympathetic towards the alras views abortion was powerfully brought to the nations attention by the thalidomide cases of 195962 thalidomide was introduced to the uk in 1958 as a wonder drug for insomnia colds coughs and headaches it was also used to alleviate the symptoms of morning sickness however an increase in the numbers of babies born with missing or stunted limbs was linked back to the drug pregnant women who had taken thalidomide and were at risk of having a baby with deformities were often keen to abort it became obvious to the alra from the press coverage that their cause was no longer a minority movement but had mass support with abortion back on the agenda the alra was reinvigorated with new younger members including men married parents and a number of high profile figures they set a clear agenda to increase their media profile and use the media to gain public sympathy widen their membership and financial support and up the ante in parliament 1964 saw a change in the parliamentary makeup as the labour party returned to rule under harold wilson this government had a strong liberalisation emphasis the laws on homosexuality capital punishment abortion and divorce were all changed during their time in office luck of the draw each year at the start of the parliamentary session a ballot is held and the twenty members of parliament mps whose names come out top are allowed to introduce a private members bill to the house of commons on a subject of their choice in june 1966 david steel drew third place in the ballot and introduced the medical termination of pregnancy bill to the commons steels bill underwent considerable discussion and amendments before it successfully passed into law as the abortion act 1967 its passage was helped by two previous bills that had passed through the house of lords in 1965 and 1966 lord silkin introduced bills to legalise abortion  the first time parliament gave significant attention to the abortion laws the lords discussed the bills in depth and amended them extensively to try and find a law that would be acceptable the alra assisted silkin and when steel agreed to take up their cause lord silkin dropped his bill so they could focus their energy on the commons silkins bills meant that those in favour of reform already knew the hurdles they would need to overcome to get a bill passed into law parallels could be drawn with recent attempts by lord joffe to get a bill legalising assisted suicide through the lords whether he is successful or not he has done a lot to raise awareness of the issues promote debate and provoke public sympathy if a supportive mp was fortunate in the ballot for private members bills we could see a euthanasia bill successfully pass through the commons debate in the commons a number of lines of argument were used to persuade parliament that abortion should be legalised these focussed primarily on the hard cases rape extreme poverty grave risk to the mothers life and serious fetal abnormality the concerns voiced and the assurances given are interesting in light of the way medical practice has developed since the social clause the social clause in steels bill first appeared the previous year in silkins bill a main argument for the clause was backstreet abortion and the dangers inherent in cheap illegal terminations tragic cases were cited and annual numbers ranging from 14600 estimated set against the image of the overstrained wife was the injustice of a different rule for the rich  an amenable gynaecologist could always be found to carry out a safe sterile termination providing the price was right the intention of the social clause was to enable safe and free access to legal abortion for women in difficult situations steel asserted that it was not his intention to leave a wide open door for abortion on request rather he saw this clause as a just response to a social problem there were predictions that abortion on demand would inevitably follow the bma royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists rcog and other professional bodies were concerned that the doctors role would shift from medical decisionmaker to arbiter of social issues it was suspected at the time that this would prove unworkable and the womans attitude to pregnancy would be the ultimate determinant of whether she received an abortion the bills supporters rebuked these fears it is only in extreme cases that a woman wants to terminate her pregnancy david steel recognised the logical force of the two extreme views and argued that the role of legislation was to find a balance between the extremes perhaps this is inevitable in a society with diverse beliefs however when the proabortion side continue to lobby for increasingly liberal laws we must strive for positive law reform whilst recognising practically that we may never reach an ideal situation the social clause was eventually dropped from the bill but effectively reappeared in section 11a of the 1967 act continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman greater than if the pregnancy were terminated with the section 12 proviso that account may be taken of the pregnant womans actual or reasonably foreseeable environment the passage of time demonstrates that abortion is effectively available on demand about 98 of the annual 181600 conscientious objection section 41 of the 1967 act permits that no person shall be under any duty whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement to participate in any treatmentto which he has a conscientious objection this does not apply to emergency procedures this was not in the original bill but was introduced in response to concerns that doctors would be under pressure to perform terminations against their beliefs interestingly one amendment that didnt make the final act proposed that no person the experiences of doctors practising in this area are difficult to gauge beyond individual reports of discrimination this issue will become increasingly salient in the 1966 debates one reformer said that it is quite wrong for any doctor to put his ethical reasons before the consideration of his patient states that the 1967 abortion act was a huge step forward but it does not go far enoughwomen should not be forced by law to rely on the decision of their doctors who are sometimes influenced by moral rather than medical judgement their intention is clear however much philosophers may try to deny the slippery slope and reformers assert that regulations will prevent it it seems to me they must be either profoundly naïve or knowingly lying fetal abnormality with thalidomide fresh in everyones memories and new research into the effects of rubella infection on fetal development there was a general acceptance in the 1966 debate that a woman should not have to continue with a pregnancy so tragically affected however there were concerns about how such decisions could be made would it be a medical decision based on the childs predicted quality of life or the womans response to the predicted abnormality if the former how could quality of life be predicted the likely increase in ability to detect fetal abnormality including less severe complications was recognised some questioned what the serious handicap and substantial risk of section 11b would actually mean in practice since the 1967 act came into practice we have seen increased acceptance of abortion for fetal abnormality and decreasing acceptance of minor disfigurements in 2002 there were 1863 terminations for fetal disability 1 of the total 376 of these were for down syndrome one for cleft lip and palate infanticide as a logical extension a number of the bills opponents argued that infanticide was a logical extension of legalised abortion the bills supporters denied these fears infanticide seemed like an inconceivable option however it is currently supported by a number of prominent biophilosophers there seems to be a progression in which the inconceivable ideas of yesteryear become the debated options of today and the common practice of tomorrow under this influence societys attitude towards infanticide could easily change the status of the embryo one prime issue that has never been settled is the status of the embryo politicians excused themselves from discussing this by admitting that agreement would never be reached yet they still felt able to legislate against preserving the embryo in the face of ambiguity giving the benefit of the doubt to the pregnant woman rather than the embryo in some ways this is understandable the woman is a tangible being who can express her concerns and the fetus is utterly dependent on her an influential paper at the time conclusion many express surprise that abortion is still being debated nearly 40 years later the reformers thought that with time it would become such a part of the social structure it would cease to be questioned in many ways it has abortion is deeply ingrained in society it only continues to be debated because some still believe it is both morally wrong and damaging to society and individuals proabortion groups continue to press for further liberalisation of the law they argue that access to early abortion should be easier the morning after pill and ru486 are key to this side of the debate it is prominent at the moment because of the media reaction to stories about late terminations if early abortion was easier they argue late terminations would happen less they still maintain that abortion should remain available up to birth for any reason if the woman desires it although admittedly some dont agree with this extreme agenda in the face of this ongoing debate i often wonder what a wise christian response should be i sometimes feel a temptation to give up and say this is the way societys going so lets leave it to run its course yet we have a duty to speak out for those who cannot defend themselves there is also evidence from the recent media furore that the tide of public opinion may be turning in part we need wisdom to know where to focus energy in the most needed areas one theme i picked up while reading about the 1967 act is the importance of supporting the positive alternative in the 1960s the debate was driven by the social problems stemming from unwanted pregnancies where were the churches and the christians then instead of helping women in difficult situations the christian agenda in part drove legal reform through the moral undercurrents that stigmatised single mums pregnant teenagers and family planning concerning his opponents david steel said that if they could devise some other means by which abortions would stop tomorrowthey would have a strong case to devise other means requires foresight and action on our part similarly now as our government considers legalising euthanasia we need to support and encourage the palliative care movement we may well be successful in blocking a change to the law as happened in the last review in 1994 even if not euthanasia would hopefully fail to become mainstream because of better alternatives on offer speaking in the 1966 abortion debate one mp offered reluctant support for the bill saying even if we come to the conclusion that it must proceed in some measure the passing of the bill is bound to be a proclamation of defeat on behalf of the communitylet no one suppose that a bill of this kind can be a triumph having seen our community defeated once will we stand
