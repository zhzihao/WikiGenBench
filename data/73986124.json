Titli finds out about Garv's father having two wives, but the first wife who is closer to Garv is mistrated. During the course of the wedding, Garv begins to catch feelings for her and eventually falls for her by the end of wedding. He then confesses to her. Due to past trauma, she rejects him and Garv devotes himself to God to impress Titli. \n\nTitli's second suitor humiliates Titli and Garv in front of their families.

Titli in a drunk state gets saved by Monika's brother in-law, which Garv misunderstands and pushes Titli to the ground. She confronts him later which upsets him and Garv gets into an accident.

Later Hiral lies to everyone about Titli reporting Garv and she challenges to prove herself right in three days.
