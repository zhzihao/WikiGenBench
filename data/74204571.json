The film stars Sivakarthikeyan and Aditi Shankar in the lead roles, while Saritha, Mysskin, Monisha Blessy, Yogi Babu and Sunil play supporting roles.\n\nThe film was announced in July 2022. Principal photography began the following August and wrapped in June 2023. The music was composed by Bharath Sankar, while the cinematography and editing were handled by Vidhu Ayyanna and Philomin Raj.\n\nMaaveeran was released theatrically worldwide on 14 July 2023 to positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success at the box office.\n\nPlot \nSathya is a comic book artist who writes and illustrates a comic strip about a brave warrior named Maaveeran for the Tamil newspaper Dhina Thee. However, he is also a coward who is unable to stand up for himself, ever since his father was killed several years ago in his fight against the existing system. He allows an employee at Dhina Thee to take credit for Maaveeran due to his cowardice. Nila, a sub-editor at the paper, takes a stand on Sathya's behalf, securing him the same job that he was being exploited for. Eventually, both become good friends.\n\nSathya and his family, comprising his widowed mother, Eshwari, and younger sister, Raji, along with his neighbors, are forced to move out of their slum and relocate to a high-rise apartment building by the Government of Tamil Nadu to improve their living conditions. But within a few hours of moving in, the apartment's flaws get exposed as a result of shoddy construction, crumbling walls due to unstable foundation, broken doors, poorly installed windows, and the ceiling falling apart. Eshwari confronts the contractor, Dhanraj, as well as the local councilor Paguthi, refusing to accept the uninhabitable conditions. Still, Sathya implores his mother to \"adjust\" to the conditions, instead showing his frustration via Maaveeran comic strips. Eventually, when Raji is sexually harassed by Dhanraj and Sathya is unable to do anything about it, a livid Eshwari vents out her frustration on Sathya and his cowardice and throws away all of his Maaveeran strips as well as his drawing material. \n\nDistraught, Sathya attempts suicide by trying to jump from the top floor of the apartment, but just as he has second thoughts about doing so, the shoddy construction makes way and he slips and falls, suffering a serious head injury. It is at this juncture that Sathya, on regaining consciousness, begins to experience the presence of a mysterious voice. The newfound voice, speaking like the narrator of the Maaveeran strip, takes precedence over Sathya's actions, compelling him to follow its suggestions when making decisions in his life, ranging from trivial matters to significant choices. In the course of the voice's guidance, Sathya crosses swords with the corrupt Housing Minister, M. N. Jeyakodi, whose department is responsible for building the apartment and whom the voice claims as Sathya's \"worst enemy\". Sathya, due to the voice's guidance, unwillingly takes on Jeyakodi, Dhanraj, Paguthi, and their men to further expose the apartment's poor construction. This makes him a hero in the eyes of the apartment dwellers, including Eshwari and Raji.\n\nJeyakodi's Secretary and best friend, Paramu, comes to know of the mysterious voice guiding Sathya and Sathya's reluctance to fight Jeyakodi and decides to use it to benefit Jeyakodi. He convinces Sathya to reveal on live television the voice forcing him to fight Jeyakodi and claim that the apartment construction is bad, claiming that Jeyakodi would leave him alone if he did so. This causes Sathya to be framed as a \"mentally unstable\" person, and his family is thrown out of the apartment, leaving them homeless. Further, Jeyakodi refuses to forgive Sathya and brutally beats him up, but Sathya refuses to fight back, despite the voice telling him to do so. Finally, Sathya dies. After he wakes up again, the voice stops, claiming that Sathya betrayed his family and the apartment dwellers for his gain.\n\nSathya returns to see his family homeless and feels guilty for the same. On Nila's advice, he decides to \"create his own story\" and take on Jeyakodi as well as expose the apartment's construction, even though the voice is no longer guiding him. In the process, he is willingly kidnapped by Jeyakodi and taken to his go-down, in the hopes of procuring the evidence of the unsafe construction of the apartment complex. Paramu is killed by Jeyakodi when he advises him to reveal to the public that the apartment can collapse any time and also evacuate the dwellers as failing to do so would cost him the upcoming election. Jeyakodi's men throw Paramu's body into the sea and Sathya drowns himself. After Sathya comes back alive, he begins to hear the mysterious voice again, this time much to his happiness. He returns to the apartment, where he unsuccessfully tries to convince the dwellers to evacuate the apartment as it would collapse any moment. \n\nJeyakodi arrives at the apartment and mocks Sathya, prompting him to challenge Jeyakodi to stay in the apartment if he is fully sure that it will not collapse. Jeyakodi refuses to do so, which makes the apartment dwellers believe Sathya and they all evacuate, just in time before the apartment starts collapsing, with the apartment sign falling on Jeyakodi, crushing him to death. Sathya then realises that one of the dwellers, his neighbor's daughter, Ilavarasi, is still trapped in the apartment, and rushes to save her. While he manages to save her, at the same time, the apartment collapses with Sathya still inside. In the aftermath of the collapse, the dwellers all search for Sathya. He is found beneath the rubbble wreckage, but is seemingly dead.\n\nTwo years later, with another government in place, the apartment is being rebuilt, this time being built keeping the dwellers in loop and with a good and strong construction. It is also revealed that Sathya miraculously survived the apartment collapse and still works for Dhina Thee, writing and illustrating Maaveeran, but the incident has left him permanently deaf. However, his reflexes have sharpened as well. Ilavarasi approaches Sathya with a question about his survival and it becomes clear that the enigmatic voice has once again reappeared, breathing life back into Sathya in the aftermath of the apartment collapse.\n\nCast\n\nVoice cast \nVijay Sethupathi as narrator for Sathya.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \nIn December 2021, reports said that Sivakarthikeyan signed a new film with Madonne Ashwin, who directed Mandela, under Vels Films International, and the film will start shooting in July 2022.
