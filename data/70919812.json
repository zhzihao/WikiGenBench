The Department of Transportation is responsible for carrying out federal transportation policy, and the Department of Homeland Security is responsible for security in transportation.\n\nPolicy development \n\nThe Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, and this power was upheld by the Supreme Court in Gibbons v. Ogden. Transportation regulations are created by agencies within the Department of Transportation, and the department is responsible for carrying out federal transportation policy. The mission statement of the Department of Transportation is \"to deliver the world’s leading transportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods.\" Congress is also authorized to establish post roads as part of the Postal Clause. Federal transportation policy is codified under Title 49 of the United States Code and Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\nThe need for federal transportation policy arose as the United States spread westward in the 19th century. The National Road was funded by the federal government in 1806 to connect the East Coast and the Midwest. The General Survey Act of 1824 authorized surveys to plan transportation routes that were considered to be of national importance. The Department of Transportation was established in 1967. The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 tasked the Department of Transportation with regulating the transport of hazardous materials. Transportation policy was heavily deregulated in the 1970s and 1980s. Transportation planning was reformed by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991.\n\nThe September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks prompted significant changes to transportation security policy in the 2000s. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which took over responsibilities for airport security from private companies. The Department of Homeland Security was created by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and this department took control of the TSA, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the United States Coast Guard, among other agencies.\n\nAviation policy \n\nAir transportation in the United States is overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for airports, air traffic control, and aviation safety regulations. Regulations vary depending on the type of aircraft, with aircraft of different sizes and purposes subject to different regulations. Other relevant organizations to aviation policy include the Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for security in airports, and NASA, which is responsible for aviation research. Airports in the United States are typically publicly owned with operations contracted to private companies, though airports may be privatized under the Airport Investment Partnership Program of 1997. Foreign air carriers are required to comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization and to establish an aviation security agreement with the United States before operating in American airspace.\n\nThe first federal aviation agency was created in 1915, when the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was established to conduct aeronautical research. The Air Commerce Act of 1926 established the Aeronautic Branch within the Department of Commerce to regulate aviation, and the branch was reformed into the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1934. In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act replaced the Bureau of Air Commerce with the Civil Aeronautics Authority, granting the new agency regulatory powers over airline fares and routes. Two years later, the Civil Aeronautics Authority was split into the Civil Aeronautics Administration, which regulated air traffic control, and the Civil Aeronautics Board, which regulated aviation safety. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 replaced the Civil Aeronautics Authority with the Federal Aviation Agency, which would later be named the Federal Aviation Administration. NACA was also replaced at this time, with NASA being established to expand aeronautic research to cover space travel research. The National Transportation Safety Board was established in 1967 to take over the accident investigation powers of the Civil Aeronautics Board. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 relinquished federal control over airline fares and routes and abolished the Civil Aeronautics Board.\n\nMaritime policy \n\nWater transport in the United States is overseen by the Maritime Administration, the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, and the Federal Maritime Commission. The United States Merchant Marine is a fleet of civilian and federal owned ships that transports goods in American waters and serves as an auxiliary to the Navy. Federal courts have jurisdiction over maritime law.\n\nThe United States Shipping Board was created in 1916. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 regulates maritime commerce and restricts cabotage. The Shipping Board was abolished in 1934 and replaced by the United States Maritime Commission in 1936. The Maritime Commission was replaced by the Maritime Administration in 1950.\n\nRail policy \n\nRail transportation in the United States is overseen by the Federal Railroad Administration. Amtrak is a government-owned corporation responsible for intercity rail.\n\nSeveral Pacific Railroad Acts were passed in the 1860s to encourage the development of a transcontinental railroad, and the first transcontinental railroad was constructed to connect the eastern railroad networks to the West Coast in 1869. Throughout the 19th century, railroads were privately owned, resulting in natural monopolies and price fixing, particularly among shorter routes. Congress responded by passing the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, the first law to create a federal regulatory body for a specific industry. The Interstate Commerce Act applied several regulations to railroad prices and established the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The powers of the ICC were expanded by laws such as the Elkins Act of 1903, the Hepburn Act of 1906, the Mann–Elkins Act of 1910, and the Valuation Act of 1913. The Railroad Safety Appliance Act of 1893 was passed as an early regulation of rail safety.\n\nCongress funded high-speed rail with the High-Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965. The 4R Act of 1976 and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated railroads as part of an overhaul of American transportation policy. The ICC was replaced with the Surface Transportation Board in 1995.\n\nRoad policy \n\nDriving in the United States is overseen by the Federal Highway Administration. The federal government is responsible for the interstate highways, while most other roads are maintained by local and state governments. Road safety is a major concern in American transportation policy. About 95% of transportation-related deaths occur on streets, roads, and highways. Road safety policy is overseen by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The United States is also a party to the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic.\n\nIn 1905, the Office of Public Roads was established by merging the Division of Tests and the Office of Public Road Inquiries. 10% of the excess funds produced by the Forest Service were appropriated for the production of federal roads serving national forests. Its name was changed to the Bureau of Public Roads in 1919. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 was the first law to fund federal highways, and several Federal-Aid Highway Acts were passed through the 20th century to build on this law. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 authorized the construction of interstate highways, and the federal government set standards with input from state administrations. Upon entering the Korean War military readiness became a concern and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1952 increased funding for the highways to this end. President Eisenhower was a strong advocate for a national highway system, and his administration successfully pushed for further expansion in the Federal-Aid Highway Acts of 1954 and 1956. The National Maximum Speed Law was enacted in 1974 and would not be repealed until 1995. The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 deregulated trucking.\n\nThe Highway Beautification Act establishes regulations for the environments surrounding federal highways. Interstate Highway standards are regulated by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Road signs are standardized by the Federal Highway Administration in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The Highway Trust Fund is used to finance federal road maintenance. Odometer fraud is a federal crime under the Federal Odometer Act.\n\nSee also \n\n Space policy of the United States\n Timeline of United States railway history\n Transportation safety in the United States\n\nReferences \n\nUnited States federal policy\n \nTransportation in the United States\nTransportation planning", "unikey": "Transportation policy of the United States", "summary": "Transportation in the United States is governed by laws and regulations of the federal government.

clause gives congress authority over interstate navigation facts seeking a monopoly over navigation on the waters throughout the us robert r livingston and robert fulton secured exclusive privileges to the waters in new york for a period of 20 years as well as the lower mississippi river aaron ogden and other competitors tried to forestall the monopoly but livingston and fulton largely succeeded in selling franchises or buying boats of competitors ogden formed a partnership with thomas gibbons but this fell apart after three years when gibbons operated another steamboat on a route in new york that belonged to ogden when ogden brought an action against gibbons in new york state court he received a permanent injunction the court rejected an argument by famous lawyer daniel webster on behalf of gibbons which asserted that the us congress controlled interstate commerce the case became one of several reviewed by the us supreme court that concerned the proper interpretation of the commerce clause in article i section 8 of the constitution attorneys daniel webster defendant thomas addis emmet plaintiff thomas j oakley plaintiff william wirt defendant opinions majority john marshall author bushrod washington thomas todd gabriel duvall joseph story reversing the state courts grant of a permanent injunction marshall agreed with websters argument that congress held exclusive power to regulate commerce among the states he believed that the definition of commerce should be interpreted broadly and that it included navigation the supremacy clause may have guided marshalls reasoning with regard to his statements that any federal license for navigation should trump any comparable license granted by a state concurrence william johnson jr author recused smith thompson author case commentary this is one of the foundational cases on the broad congressional powers under the commerce clause interstate navigation is clearly part of interstate commerce so states cannot interfere with it by overly regulating the area and creating burdens not imposed by congress the case is also notable in that it featured a virtual allstar cast of 19thcentury american lawyers which showed how

certificate of registration alone is not evidence of ownership of an aircraft in a proceeding in which ownership may be in issue 49 usc  44103 the best evidence of ownership for an faaregistered aircraft is an original bill of sale from the manufacturerseller to the current owner for multiple priorowner aircraft the current owner should establish a chain of title with all prior bills of sale

broadly speaking what are the rules around the operation of this register the faa aircraft registry is a public database where mortgages liens and other security interests can be recorded against an aircraft 14 cfr part 49 contains the requirements for recordation of mortgages and other security interests registration documents consist of an aircraft registration application ac form 80501 evidence of ownership ie bill of sales or chain of title and a 500 registration fee to the faa all documents must include the manufacturer model serial number registration number and original signatures in order to register an aircraft on the faa aircraft registry the aircraft must owned by 1 a us citizen 2 a partnership each of whose partners is a us citizen 3 a us corporation of which the president and at least twothirds of the board of directors are us citizens and at least 75 of the voting interest is owned or controlled by us citizens 4 a citizen of a foreign country lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the us 5 a us governmental unit or subdivision or 6 a nonus citizen corporation organised and doing business under the law of the us or one of its states as long as the aircraft is based and primarily used in the us 60 of all flight hours being from flights starting and ending in the us 14 cfr part 47 an aircraft registered in a foreign country is not eligible for us registration id the cape town convention and related protocol on aircraft equipment is an international treaty that recognises an international registry for registering ownership and security interests the faa aircraft registry serves as the entry point for registering an aircraft according to the cape town convention 23 are there any particular regulatory requirements which a lessor or a financier needs to be aware of as regards aircraft operation a lessor or financier should require its lesseeoperator to comply with all applicable faa and dot aircraft operation regulations 14 cfr part 91 sets forth general rules regarding operation of civil aircraft the lesseeoperator must meet certain requirements including for example licensure of the aircraft pilot the lease agreement should explicitly provide that the lessee maintains operational control of the aircraft moreover lease agreements must include a written truthinleasing clause as a concluding paragraph which satisfies the requirements set forth in 14 cfr part 91 the lease is then filed with the faa for truthinleasing purposes only and within 24 hours of execution a copy of the lease must be sent to the aircraft registration branch the lessee must notify the faa of the time departure location and the aircrafts registration number at least 48 hours prior to the first flight a copy of the lease must be carried aboard the aircraft at all times 24 as a matter of local law is there any concept of title annexation whereby ownership or security interests in a single engine are at risk of automatic transfer or other prejudice when installed onwing on an aircraft owned by another party if so what are the conditions to such title annexation and can owners and financiers of engines take preemptive steps to mitigate the risks yes the cape town convention to which us is a signatory defines aircraft engines and airframes as distinct and separate aircraft objects pursuant to article xiv3 of the aircraft equipment protocol ownership of or another right or interest in an aircraft engine shall not be affected by its installation on or removal from an aircraft 25 what if any are the tax implications in your jurisdiction for aircraft trading as regards a valueadded tax vat andor goods and services tax gst and b documentary taxes such as stamp duty and to the extent applicable do exemptions exist as regards nondomestic purchasers and sellers of aircraft andor particular aircraft types or operations tax implications are unique to each transaction given the interplay between us federal and each states tax laws and applicable treaties aircraft transactions including the use sale or lease of an aircraft involving the us or us citizens can be subject to federal andor states tax laws regulations and treaties the favourability of tax treatment varies based upon factors such as the jurisdiction of the persons involved in the transaction the situs of closing the intended use of the aircraft subsequent to closing and others there is no vat in the us parties must consult the us tax code title 26 of the united states code with respect to any aircraft sale or lease transaction in the us with a us entity or citizen for example the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja pub l no 11597 131 stat 2054 eliminates the deferment of gains and losses for the likekind exchange of aircraft but expands the use of bonus depreciation of all qualifying new and preowned equipment to 100 therefore the tcja allows taxpayers to immediately write off the cost of an aircraft acquired and placed in service between september 17 2017 and january 1 2023 in addition to each state promulgating its own tax laws within a state there may be county or city tax laws most states collect sales tax on transactions involving tangible personal property specifically state taxes for aircraft purchases and transactions range widely between 2 virginia and 75 california five states  alaska delaware montana new hampshire and oregon  do not have a state sales tax this means that sales taxes will not be assessed for aircraft delivered in these five states there are states that provide special tax treatment and exemptions specific to transactions involving aircraft for example in 2021 massachusetts introduced a bill that would repeal the aircraft sales tax exemption which has been heavily opposed by the aviation industry to date the bill has not passed new york maine connecticut and rhode island exempt aircraft from sales tax while others cap the sales tax on aircraft sales and leases south carolina  500 north carolina  2500 virginia and alabama  2 some states such as arizona arkansas california colorado florida georgia illinois michigan and texas have a flyaway exemption which exempts the transaction from sales tax if the aircraft is flown out of the state within a specified period of time after closing other states eg indiana michigan ohio louisiana and texas provide a lessor exemption that typically comes in the form of a resale exemption a lessor can elect to pay use tax on receipts from the rentallease of an aircraft in lieu of payment of sales or use tax on the full cost of the aircraft at the time of purchase the specifics of a lessor exemption differ from state to state 26 is your jurisdiction a signatory to the main international conventions montreal geneva

1887 congress passed the interstate commerce act making the railroads the first industry subject to federal regulation congress passed the law largely in response to decades of public demand that railroad operations be regulated the act also established a fivemember enforcement board known as the interstate commerce commission in the years following the civil war railroads were privately owned and entirely unregulated the railroad companies held a natural monopoly in the areas that only they serviced monopolies are generally viewed as harmful because they obstruct the free competition that determines the price and quality of products and services offered to the public the railroad monopolies had the power to set prices exclude competitors and control the market in several geographic areas although there was competition among railroads for longhaul routes there was none for shorthaul runs railroads discriminated in the prices they charged to passengers and shippers in different localities by providing rebates to large shippers or buyers these practices were especially harmful to american farmers who lacked the shipment volume necessary to obtain more favorable rates early political action against these railroad monopolies came in the 1870s from granger controlled state legislatures in the west and south the granger movement had started in the 1860s providing various benefits to isolated rural communities state controls of railroad monopolies were upheld by the supreme court inmunn v illinois1877 state regulations and commissions however proved to be ineffective incompetent and even corrupt in the 1886wabashcase the supreme court struck down an illinois law outlawing longandshort haul discrimination nevertheless an important result ofwabashwas that the court clearly established the exclusive power of congress to regulate interstate commerce see gibbons v ogden the interstate commerce act addressed the problem of railroad monopolies by setting guidelines for how the railroads could do business the act became law with the support of both major political parties and pressure groups from all regions of the country applying only to railroads the law required just and reasonable rate changes prohibited special rates or rebates for individual shippers prohibited preference in rates for any particular localities shippers or products forbade longhaulshorthaul discrimination prohibited pooling of traffic or markets and most important established a fivemember interstate commerce commission icc the laws terms often contradicted one another some provisions were designed to stimulate competition and others to penalize it in practice the law was not very effective the most successful provisions of the law were the requirement that railroads submit annual reports to the icc and the ban on special rates the railroads would arrange among themselves although determining which rates were discriminatory was technically and politically difficult years later the icc would become the model for many other regulatory agencies  but in 1887 it was unique the interstate commerce act challenged the philosophy of laissezfaire economics by clearly providing the right of congress to regulate private corporations engaged in interstate commerce the act with its provision for the icc remains one of americas most important

building the foundation by richard f weingroff here was the basic split that would have to be resolved before federal aid could become a reality farmers wanted allweather farmtomarket roads motorist groups and the automobile industry wanted hardsurfaced interstate roads faced with these conflicting viewpoints congress decided to study the issue in two ways first the post office department appropriations bill for 1913 enacted aug 24 1912 appropriated 500000 for an experimental program to improve post roads the funds would be made available to state or local governments that agreed to pay twothirds of the cost of the projects second the act authorized a joint congressional committee to prepare a report on the issues involved in providing federal aid for highways the post road program was plagued with problems many state and local officials resented oprs oversight of their projects according to a report to congress on the program local officials showed a disposition frequently to avoid the obvious requirements of the present act state and local officials also objected to certain federal requirements such as a federal statute requiring an eighthour day for workers and a 1915 executive order barring convict labor on government work the us attorney general eventually concluded that because the projects were not the public work of the united states these restrictions did not apply ultimately post road projects covered 735 kilometers of road in 28 counties in 17 states although these figures were disappointing the program provided valuable experience that was reflected in later decisions on federal aid the most important result was the realization that federal aid should go only to the states not to the counties opr was too small to work with 3000 counties each with its own public works mechanism the joint committee headed by sen jonathan bourne jr of oregon reported to congress in january 1915 the committee dismissed the constitutional question and endorsed federal aid but was unable to resolve differences on the details serious consideration of a federal road program began early in 1916 when the house of representatives acted on shacklefords latest federalaid plan it authorized 25 million to improve rural post roads with the federal share being not less than 30 percent nor more than 50 percent the funds would be apportioned to the states  half on the basis of population and half based on mileage of rfd and star mail delivery routes a star route was a delivery route awarded by contract to a private carrier the states would select projects subject to federal review of surveys plans and estimates all work would be under the supervision and control of the states beginning in 1920 any state receiving aid must have a state highway agency the house approved the plan 281 to 81 on jan 25 1916 reaction was mixed southern good roads magazine summed up support for the bill  the act is horsehigh bullstrong and pigtight it is pure business and without the least touch of sentiment by contrast opponents thought the apportionment formula gave too little aid to the states that needed it the most others questioned spending so much for roads given the need for national defense funding since war had begun in europe still others feared state and local officials would use federal aid for pork projects to reward political supporters direct federal construction of a highway network was the solution to the pork problem the shackleford bill was referred to the senate committee on post offices and post roads headed by sen john h bankhead of alabama bankhead a longtime advocate of federal aid for roads was also a close associate of page in considering federal aid in 1916 bankhead would be guided by page and through him by aasho when aasho was founded the first order of business was the drafting of a federalaid bill to be submitted to congress initial efforts by aasho were stalled because of conflicting interests among the heavily populated states that had already developed highway networks and the lesspopulated states that had not yet done so in september 1915 during the panamerican road congress in oakland calif a small group of aasho members met to draft a federalaid bill that struck a balance among the interests thomas h macdonald chief engineer of the iowa state highway commission and an associate of page headed the small group the aasho bill proposed to appropriate 75 million over five years to be apportioned to the states by formula onethird based on total area onethird by population and onethird by mileage of rural delivery and star routes the federal share would be 50 percent but payments could not exceed 10000 per mile each state was required to have a state highway agency that would select the rural post road projects but they would have to submit their programs of projects  as well as the surveys plans specifications and estimates  to the secretary of agriculture for approval all improved roads must be free from tolls and must be maintained by the state no money could be expended in any state until its legislature had agreed to the provisions of the act the governors assent would be satisfactory until the legislature acted bankhead amended the shackleford bill by deleting everything after the enacting clause be it enacted  and substituting the aasho bill with page providing factual analytical and other support bankhead took the bill to the senate floor for debate on may 8 1916 the senate approved the bankhead bill with some amendments in addition to the 75 million the bill authorized for federalaid improvements the senate approved 10 million 1 million per year for 10 years for roads and trails within or only partly within the national forests debate in the house and senate had been extensive constitutional and states rights issues were debated as was the concern that the bill was establishing a pork barrel however by far the majority of the debate related to the formula for apportioning funds among the states and the exclusion of cities from the benefits of the act the housesenate conference committee completed work on june 27 after making some changes in the bankhead bill but leaving it largely in tact both houses approved the bill the same day the federal aid road act of 1916 was in many ways the embodiment of pages ideals each state would have a highway agency with engineering professionals to carry out the federalaid projects page and his engineers had approval authority so they could ensure the projects were designed and constructed properly the 1916 act also served the social function of enhancing life in rural america by focusing on rural post roads rather than the longdistance roads advocated by aaa and many others as historian bruce seely said by incorporating this vision the nations first highway policy combined the progressive goals of economic efficiency and social betterment on july 11 1916 president wilson signed the bill in a white house ceremony that was attended by members of congress and representatives of aaa aasho and farm organizations the federalaid highway program of
