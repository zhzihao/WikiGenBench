{"id": 72190631, "key": "Pendency of court cases in India", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendency%20of%20court%20cases%20in%20India", "text": "Pendency of court cases in India is the delay in the disposal of cases (lawsuits) to provide justice to the aggrieved person or organisation by judicial courts at all levels. The judiciary in India works in hierarchy at three levels - federal or supreme court, state or high courts, and district courts. The court cases is categorised into two types - civil and criminal. In 2022, the total number of pending cases of all types and at all levels rose to 50 million or 5 crores, including over 169,000 court cases pending for more than 30 years in district and high courts. 4.3 crore out of 5 crore cases, i.e more than 85% cases, are pending in district courts as of December 2022. Government itself is the biggest litigant, having 50% of the pending cases being sponsored by the state.\n\nIndia has the largest number of pending court cases in the world. Many judges and government officials have said that the pendency of cases is the biggest challenge before Indian judiciary. According to a 2018 Niti Aayog strategy paper, at the then-prevailing rate of disposal of cases in our courts, it would take more than 324 years to clear the backlog. At that time in 2018, the pending cases stood at 29 million. With the cases taking time in courts, it leads to delays in the delivery of justice for both victim and accused.\n\nPendency of cases cost 1.5%-2% of India's GDP.\n\nCauses of pendency\n\nLow strength of judges and non-judicial staff \nIn 2022, the sanctioned strength of judges in India was 21.03 judges per million population. The absolute sanctioned strength of judges were 34 in Supreme Court, 1108 in high courts, and 24,631 in district courts. Law commission of India and Justice V S Malimath Committee had recommended in the past to raise the strength of judges to 50 judges per million population, or 20,000 population per judge.\n\nThe sanctioned strength of judges of the Supreme Court of India can be increased by the Parliament passing a law. The sanctioned strength of judges of a High Court can be increased by the High Court making a recommendation and after it has been approved by the respective state government, its governor, the Chief Justice of India and the union government.\n\nVacant position of the judges \nDespite sanctioned strength of judges, courts in India have often not worked in full capacity due to vacancy of judges. In 2022, the working strength of judges in India was 14.4 judges per million population. It has changed marginally from 13.2 in 2016. In comparison, the strength of judges are 210 judges per million in Europe and 150 in the United States. Non-judicial staff positions also remain vacant with some states having vacancy upto 25% in 2018-19.\n\nVacancies in courts keep on arising periodically due to retirement, resignation, demise, or elevation of judges. The appointment of judges is a long process. Supreme Court judges are recommended for appointment by the Supreme Court collegium, consisting of the Chief Justice of India and the four remaining senior-most judges of the Supreme court. The names have to be approved by the union government before being appointed by the President.\n\nThe high court judges are recommended for appointment by the High Court collegium consisting of the Chief Justice of the High Court, and two remaining senior-most judges of the high court. The names have to be approved by the state government, the governor, the Chief Justice of India, and the union government before being appointed by the President.\n\nThe union government and the state government are binding to abide by the suggestion of the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of the High court and their collegium in the appointment of the judges. However, the rule is seldom followed in time and the union government would delay the appointment or return the names for appointment. As per rule, the union government must approve the appointments in 3–4 weeks if the collegium reiterates the names.\n\nThe lack of coordination and cooperation is a major cause for the vacancy in the higher judiciary. In some cases, the appointment of judges has been delayed for 4 years due to the names pending with the union government for approval.\n\nThe district or lower court judge appointments in a state are made by the respective high court, the governor, and the State Public Service Commission. The exams are conducted for the appointment of the district judges and the civil judges. The examination for the civil judges appointment is conducted by the State Public Service Commission in 10 states only; while all other examination for the judge's appointment in a state jurisdiction is conducted by the High Court themselves. The examination and appointment process are not efficient. In 2018, Supreme Court noted that there was a mismatch in the number of posts vacant in the lower courts and the recruitment underway. In 2022, Bihar Public Service Commission took 30 months just to complete the examination. The union government has proposed setting up AIJS (All India Judicial Service) to tackle vacancies in the lower judiciary by centralising the recruitment process.\n\nLower judiciary suffers also from not attracting and retaining talented judges, and lack of career progression. Many judges have been quitting the judiciary to go into private practice or join top private law firms, as it offers a lot more in terms of remuneration. Many states have been criticised for the pay offered to lower court judges. Recommendations of the Judicial Pay Commission and the Supreme Court orders to increase the judges salary are not implemented by the states. In Delhi Judiciary exam 2019, 66 percent seats could not be filled as candidates were simply unable to score even the cut off marks. In Jammu and Kashmir judiciary exam 2019, not one candidate passed the district judge exam for the fourth consecutive time. In Tamil Nadu judiciary exam 2019, of around 3,500 lawyers appearing for the district judge examination, none passed.\n\nInadequate funding \nExcept the Supreme Court which is funded by the central government, all the expenses of the High Court and the District Courts in a state are funded by the respective state government. As of 2018, 92% of all expenditure on the judiciary was borne by the states. This includes salary of judges, non-judicial staff and all operation costs. In 2019, India spent 0.08% of its GDP on the judiciary. All states and union territories allocated less than 1% of its annual budget on the judiciary, except Delhi with 1.9%. There is no guideline for the state expenditure on the judiciary to ensure higher efficiency of the judiciary.\n\nIn comparison, United States spends 2% of its annual budget on judiciary.\n\nLack of infrastructure \nDistrict or lower courts are prone to lack of infrastructure. In 2022, there were only 20,143 court halls and 17,800 residential units for judicial officers available to use against the sanctioned strength of 24,631 lower court judges. Only 40% of the lower court buildings have fully functional toilets with some having no provisions for regular cleaning. Lower courts also suffer from the lack of digital infrastructure, video conferencing rooms, and video connectivity to jails and officers. Development of the infrastructure facilities for judiciary rests with the State Governments. In 2021, Chief Justice N V Ramana had proposed to set up NJIAI (National Judicial Infrastructure Authority of India) to perform administrative work of the judiciary including infrastructure development. In comparison, there are similar body within Judiciary in other countries, for example, Administrative Office of the United States Courts in US.\n\nAbuse of legal procedure \nCourt cases proceed as per rules described in CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure) and CPC (Code of Civil Procedure). CrPC and CPC have been criticised for being archaic. Adjournments have been used as a tool to delay the proceedings. Lawyers unrestrictedly argue with unrelated oral arguments and submit impractical, long written pleadings to waste time and delay the proceedings.\n\nIn contrast, while hearing a case in October 2022, Supreme Court concluded the hearing in only 8 days after it set the time limits for arguments, and allowed no repetitions.\n\nOne CrPC rule does not allow criminal cases to proceed if either an accused or a witness is not present before the court. This rule alone accounts for the delay in over 60% of all pending criminal cases, as per NJDG in November 2022.\n\nCorruption and apathy of officials helps in the aiding and abetting abuse of the legal procedure.\n\nState-wise statistics \nCourthall shortfall is calculated as lack of courthalls as percentage of the total sanctioned strength of the judges. A negative percentage means courthalls are in excess. Case clearance rate (CCR) is cases disposed in a year as a percentage of new cases filed in the same year. CCR of less than 100 means case pendency will increase, CCR equal to 100 means case pendency will remain same, CCR of more than 100 means case pendency will decrease. NA: Not Available.

reservation in promotions to scheduled caste and scheduled tribe scst government employees the judgment asserted that it was wrong to equate merit with candidates who perform better than other candidates on seemingly neutral criteria eg standardised examinations this is a distorted understanding of the function merit plays in society the honourable judges explained a meritorious candidate is not merely one who is talented or successful but also one whose appointment fulfils the constitutional goals of uplifting members of the scs and stsbut there are no reservation for scs sts or other backward classes obcs for judges posts in the supreme court and high courts in india currently among the 33 supreme court judges there is only one sc and one obc judgein november 1998 the thenpresident of india kr narayanan noted on a file seeking his assent for the appointment of four supreme court judges it would be consonant with constitutional principles and the nations social objectives if persons belonging to weaker sections of society like scs and stsare given due consideration eligible persons from these categories are available and their underrepresentation or nonrepresentation would not be justifiablestory continues below advertisementremove adthe thenchief justice as anand responded i would like to assert that merit alone has been the criterion for selection of judges all eligible candidates including those belonging to the scheduled castes and tribes are considered while recommending names for appointment as supreme court judges that meaning of that word merit seems very malleableso one could well ask of what value are these weekend pontifications that we are being subjected to currently last year the honourable justice dy chandrachud described dissent as democracys safety valve and said that branding those who dissent as antinational or antidemocratic strikes at the heart of our commitment to protect constitutional valuesfair enough but a couple of weekends ago nv ramana the chief justice of india called for saving the judiciary from motivated and targeted attacks on social media he said that the onus lies on the central agencies to deal with the attacks against judges on social mediaso dissent is the safety valve as long as it is not about the judges and if someone criticises the judiciary the cbi or nia or whatever should be let loose on heron constitution day november 26 the chief justice said looking back i can proudly claim that as an institution the judiciary has lived up to the faith reposed in it by the constituent assembly the fact that the indian judiciary continues to be the last hope for those in distress suggests that it is on the right track i am sure that the people whose fates are held at ransom in the 44 million pending casesand remember more than one lakh of these cases have been pending forover 30 yearswere happy to hear these wordsour courts also seem to love headlines they seem to prioritise cases that would get media attention even if that means intruding into areas clearly reserved in the constitution for the legislature and the executive consider the three farm laws which have now been repealed did the supreme court have any business getting into these and then after it did why did it sit on the report submitted by the committee it set up to study the farm laws meanwhile the agitations escalated and lives were lost the report was strongly positive about the farm lawsto end with a personal anecdote i have been doing the rounds of delhi courts for 16 years now for what originally began as a libel suit about an article published in a magazine i once worked for while i cannot go into the details of the case for obvious reasons i can say that i heard of the

words supreme court struggles with long submissions analysis buried in words supreme court struggles with long submissions gauri kashyap  30th oct 2022 to be an efficient constitutional court sc must devise a way to cut down length of submissions sco spoke to legal researchers or law clerks who assist judges in day to day functioning of the court they comb through submissions cases and other resources to provide judges with relevant information in every case allotted to them in detail legal researchers are required to study all forms of written submissions including pleadings written arguments notes referred judgments and any other document provided by a counsel rohit a former legal researcher at the supreme court in a conversation with sco said that the length of submissions in slps is inevitable under the present system an slp filed to challenge a lower court decision must contain the judgment being challenged as well that judgment ends up being long so the lower courts and high courts contribute to the issue of overly long submissions the issue extends to criminal cases as well ms nikhat another former legal researcher at the supreme court told sco that often in lower court judgments length of the decisions doesnt necessarily mean there is as much content in it chargesheet framing of charges every testimony and argument regurgitates the same set of facts over and over again after the challenged judgment is reiterated the criminal slp makes its own argument retelling the same facts mr vasudev devadasan former legal researcher for justice dy chandrachud told sco that there are very few pages of the slp that you actually need to read to understand the issue he believes that lawyers have their hand in creating this culture of long submissions he said there is a tendency to be overinclusive and include everything under the sun in written submissions he gave examples of small service matters where therell be repeated allegations of violation of natural justice violation of constitutional rights taking up 5pages of your grounds even though both judge and lawyer know its largely irrelevant to the issue at hand and its never argued orally but all of this gets thrown into the written submissions however even mr devadasan believes that there are some situations where lengthy written documentation is unavoidable some matters are so factually complex that the sc would rather have everything on record even if the written submissions are very brief the supporting documentation is extremely voluminous so theres no way to avoid that this is often the case where the supreme courts original jurisdiction is invoked or where the matter touches on a large number of parties or legal issues repetitions roundabout points and long days of arguments a 2013 paper suggested that the courts burden of slps is aggravated by senior advocates mr tarunab khaitan argued that slps where senior advocates appeared were more likely to be admitted to court even though they were false positives that is cases where the supreme court ultimately upheld the challenged judgment also made their way into the system merely because a senior would approach the bench seniors enjoy the benefits of their seniority even while arguing in court on the seventh day of hearings in the hijab ban challenge senior advocate dushyant dave made himself comfortable and launched into a long winded exposition about secularism under emperor akbars reign baroda maharaja sayajirao gaekwads reformist policies and read out excerpts from various debates in the constituent assembly he was arguing that a secular country protected all religious practices justices hemant gupta and sudhanshu dhulia who had constricted many other lawyers including senior advocates to strict 15 minute time limits could only express their impatience mr dave finished all his points repeated arguments and took up one entire day of nine days of hearings in zakia jafri v state of gujarat justices khanwilkar maheshwari and ravikumar were generous with the courts time full day hearings went on for two weeks so the court could decide if the clean chit given to 63 accused persons in the 2002 gujarat riots needed to be reopened senior advocate kapil sibal argued for seven of the 14 days solicitor general tushar mehta and senior advocate mukul rohatgi took up the other 7 days in contrast a 5judge bench deciding crucial constitutional questions in the ews reservations challenge completed hearings in nearly half the time mr devadasan whose role as legal researcher required him to read through submissions and brief a judge broke down the process for sco with a hypothetical he explained you have a 7080 page slp and a 45 page impugned or challenged judgment and then the oral submission often hinges on just one narrow point in one paragraph of that judgment there are definitely some issues where the factual complexity requires longer submissions but even in those longer submissions there is still a lot of overlap in the different components of an slp in zakia jafri the protest petition was 322 pages mr sibal took the court through instance after instance where the special investigation team had failed to assess evidence pointing to a conspiracy taking up inordinate amounts of the courts time has a ripple effect as ms nikhat explained to sco ive seen lawyers take 35 hours of the courts time on nonmiscellaneous days when hearings in their case have already gone on for multiple days this doesnt help the pendency of cases at all it puts a burden on the court takes time increases costs and doesnt let other matters come up there are currently 69461 cases pending at the supreme court what can the court do to limit written submissions and who can it learn from it is not as though lawyers are incapable of drafting excellent written submissions if you see the written submissions that come after oral arguments they are very well thought out much briefer and far more targeted mr devadasan said to sco what is it then that can ensure that shorter pointed submissions come before the court in the hearing on september 1st 2022 justice bhat suggested introducing page limits for slps mr rohit told sco that this might work but the lawyers themselves will have to take this initiative he suggests that writing complex drafts is an attitudinal problem it is a problem with drafting some lawyers probably want to show to their clients that theyve put in a lot of effort for many others it is about the convenience of arguments in court they may prefer having all their material in one place the slp instead of going through a hundred books the supreme court of the united states scotus follows a system similar to justice bhats suggestion the 2019 scotus rulebook stipulates word limits for each type of submission including writs arguments on merits by the petitioner or appellant replies and briefs submitted by amicus curiae parties may request permission from the court to exceed this limit but such leave is not favoured the attorney appearing before the court must furnish a certificate disclosing the number of words used and declaring that the submissions adhere to the word limit only then can they submit the case document to the court the united kingdom supreme court uksc follows a different approach though it does not impose an upper limit for submissions the uksc practice directions 6 favours brevity would these restrictions work in india ms nikhat had some concerns she said if we started to constrict the rules too much it would become a super literate lawyers jobthis is a huge reason why the sc registry accepts slps and just asks for lawyers to fix defects and small mistakes i think its kept so loose because they dont want to outright reject the slps and they want everyone to have their day in court so to speak im not in favour of making these rules too harsh because we understand where a lot of people in this country are coming from should oral submissions be limited too scotus and uksc also impose a limit on the durations of oral arguments all nine judges of the scotus hear every case together thismeans that only one case can be heard at a time in the interest of using the scotus time most efficiently lawyers are instructed to strictly limit their oral submissions to 30 minutes as arguments go on the marshal indicates timeto counsels using red and white lights the scotus 2019 guide for counsel even gives examples of landmark cases where a counsel took less than 30 minutes perhaps to inspire the bar the uksc stipulates that no more than two counsel will be heard on behalf of a party rule 223 of the united kingdom supreme court rules 2009 states that parties should inform the registrar of the number of hours a counsel might require for their arguments counsels are instructed to adhere strictly to their estimates as the days hearing list is scheduled based on these estimations delay in one case would delay the others listed for the day this domino effect that the uksc preempts is an everyday reality in the supreme court of india the best fit for the indian supreme court may be entirely different from the us and uk supreme courts the way the 5judge bench in the ews challenge scheduled and heard cases might be the template to follow unlike the uksc the court heard far more than two lawyers per side however the preapproved time limits resembled the uksc system the 5judge bench did not impose a page or word limit on the written submissions but asked for a convenience compilation that would actually serve its purpose it appointed two lawyers as nodal counsels to communicate and coordinate between all parties to draft this document ultimately a constitution bench case dealing with critical questions of affirmative actions measures and basic structure of the constitution finished its work in eight days as of october 1st 2022 the court had 69461 pending cases on its docket this is the first time the number fell below 70000 since november 2021 offering some hope however the court and counsels will have to make considerable changes to make a real and sustained dent to

incorporating provisions for trial in absentia of an absconding accused for better administration of justice and to prevent the loss of valuable evidence due to death of a witnessit set aside as per the existing law a lower court order that allowed deposition of a gang rape victim recorded during the trial of three other accused in the same case to be used against two absconding accused who were arrested latera bench comprising justice joymalya bagchi and justice bivas pattanayak observedtaking note of the pernicious impact of abscondence on speedy justice and rights of victims this court proposes that appropriate amendments be made to the code of criminal procedure for incorporating provision for trial in absentia of an absconding accused for better administration of criminal justicethe directions were issued on a petition by kader khan an accused in the infamous park street gangrape case of 2012 that challenged the trial court order allowing the prosecution to use deposition of the victim who died in march 2015 against him during the trial he had absconded following the incident and was arrested in september 2016reliance was also placed on the supreme court judgment in hussain and another v union of india wherein the apex court on noticing the alarming trend of abscondence affecting delay in trials had referred to section 339b of the bangladesh crpc to observe that appropriate authority may take cognizance of the said lawopining that no amendment has yet been made to section 2991 crpc to provide for trial in absentia of an absconder despite such an observation by the supreme court the court remarkedinspite of such observation of the apex court no amendment has been made to section 2991 crpc to provide for trial in absentia of an absconder which may avoid unfortunate loss of valuable evidence due to death of a witness as in the present casein the instant case while caught between an absconding accused and unfortunate demise of a rape victim the prosecution had belatedly taken out an application praying the evidence of the rape victim recorded in the course of trial of other accused persons while the petitioner was absconding be read in evidence in the subsequent trial of the absconder after his arrest the concerned trial court had subsequently allowed such an applicationthe court at the outset remarked that the present case is reminiscent of an ageold adage to close the stable door after the horse has bolted however it recognised that there is a need for evolution of the law to better secure the rights of victims particularly victims of sexual abuse and accordingly observedi am unable to agree with the trial court that the deposition of the rape victim recorded in the course of earlier trial and her statement before the magistrate exhibited therein can be said to be admissible in the subsequent trial of the absconding petitioner this unfortunate loss of valuable evidence of a rape victim arises due to the prevalence of an archaic law relating to trial of absconders which does not recognize the evolution of law relating to waiver of fair trial rights of an absconder justifying trial in absentia and emergence of rights of victims particularly victims of sexual abuse against secondary victimization by giving repeated depositions in courtaccordingly the court directed the registrar general of the high court to send a copy of the judgment to the principal secretaries to the ministry of home affairs and ministry of law and justice union of india for consideration of the proposal to amend the code of criminal procedure and incorporate provision of trial in absentia of an absconding accused thereinthe court further underscored that before a prosecutor invokes section 2991 of the crpc against an absconding accused it must be proved before the trying court that the accused had absconded and that there is no imminent possibility of his arrest and upon proof of such facts the court may permit the prosecution evidence led during the trial of other accused persons be recorded against the absconding accused alsohowever opining that no such prayer had been made by the prosecutor in the instant case the court observedif the evidence is so recorded against the absconder it may be used against him in the subsequent trial upon his arrest if the witness is dead or incapable of giving evidence or is not found or his attendance cannot be procured without unreasonable delay expenses or inconvenience admittedly in the present case prosecutor did not make any prayer before the trial court during the earlier trial of the coaccuseds that the prosecution evidence recorded in the said trial be also recorded against the absconderreliance was also placed on the supreme court decision in vijay ranglal chorasiya v state of gujarat wherein the apex court had disapproved the high court to rely upon the evidence recorded in an earlier trial of coaccused persons against the absconder although such evidence had not been transferred in accordance with the provisions of section 2991 of crpcwords used in section 299 of the crpc cast an unambiguous duty on the prosecutor to obtain a direction from the committingtrying court that prosecution evidence led in the trial of coaccused be also recorded against the absconder when words of a statute are clear and unambiguous and no alternate intention can be contextually derived therefrom it is not within the domain of a court to rewrite the statute and hold that evidence recorded in the course of an earlier trial against coaccused be deemed to have been automatically recorded against the absconder even when the prosecutor has not chosen to invoke the aforesaid provision of law the court underscoredaccordingly the court set aside the impugned order by observing that a direction by the trying court in the course of subsequent trial of an absconder to treat the evidence recorded in an earlier trial of coaccused facing the same charge is an error in jurisdictionno court has jurisdiction to transfer evidence recorded in an earlier trial after its completion as evidence against an accused who had not been put up for trial in the earlier case even if both the trials are in respect of the selfsame charge this is against the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that each criminal case has to be tried on the basis of evidence led in the said case and not by reference to evidence in other cases trial court erred in law to hold such jurisdictional error was a curable irregularity and ought to be condoned under section 465 crpc in the interest of justice the court held furthercase title kader khan v state of west bengalcase citation 2022 livelaw cal 161click here to readdownload

question onin a significant judgment the kerala high court ruled that before recording witness depositions under section 299 of the code of criminal procedure it should be established that the accused has absconded and that there is no immediate prospect of arresting hima division bench of justice k vinod chandran and justice c jayachandran was called upon to answer an intriguing question on the interpretation of section 299 of the crpc after referring to a plethora of decisions it concluded as followswe are therefore of the definite opinion that the satisfaction of the facts specified in section 299 where it was held that the court which records the proceedings under it must first of all record an order that in its opinion it has been proved that the accused has absconded and that there is no immediate prospect of his arrest2 if the court has only recorded the evidence of the witnesses in the trial against the coaccused can the court conducting the subsequent trial after apprehending the absconding accused pass an order recording the existence of the above facts and transfer such evidence to the subsequent trial on the strength of such an order the court answered this question in the negativethe exercise which ought to have been done by the trial judge while recording the depositions of witnesses in absentia the absconding accused persons in terms of section 299 cannot be done by the judge when the absconding accused is put to trial pursuant to his apprehension the court noted that as laid down by several precedents section 299 being an exception to section 273 of the code and section 33 of the evidence act besides being apparently in conflict with the foundational tenets of criminal jurisprudence requires strict complianceit could therefore be held as a corollary that such proof with respect to abscondence and lack of possibility of an arrest is not a matter to be gone into at the time of the subsequent trial after apprehending the accused who was absconding in other words proof with respect to abscondence of the accused is a condition precedent to record deposition of witnesses for the purpose of section 299 enabling its use in the subsequent trial against those absconded but later apprehendedthe court further observed that the notes on clause no24 which deals with the amendment to section 299 are a sure pointer that the proof with respect to abscondence of the accused has to be adduced as a precondition for recording witness deposition before the trial magistrate or the committing magistrate in absentia the absconding accused had it been otherwise the exercise of such power by the committing magistrate is incomprehensible and unworkable the order stated the very provision of section 299 makes it axiomatic that this exercise cannot be relegated to be considered by the sessions judge who tries the absconding accused subsequently pursuant to his apprehensionas such allowing the appeal the court held that the impugned order cannot be sustained inasmuch as the jurisdictional facts under section 299 were not gone into or satisfied by the trial judge who recorded the witness depositions as a matter of fact it was recorded that the trial judge was not recording depositions for the purposes of section 299 but as evidence against the coaccused persons in the same crime who had absconded earlierwhat is the sensational palm
