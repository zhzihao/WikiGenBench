{"id": 71485811, "key": "The Strangers (film series)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Strangers%20%28film%20series%29", "text": "The Strangers film series consists of American psychological horror films. Based on an original story by Bryan Bertino, the plot centers around three masked psycho-sociopathic home invaders that prey on the innocent owners. Though the first film was marketed as \"based on a true story\", this was a misdirect as the filmmaker stated that he wrote the concept from a series of break-in burglaries that took place in his neighborhood when he was growing up, as well as borrowing elements from the Manson Family Tate killings. Continuing this marketing technique, a \"based on a true story\" tag was also included at the beginning of the sequel.\n\nThe first film was initially met with mixed critical reception upon its release, though it made a large profit at the box office. Despite this, it has since been praised by contemporary film critics, as a cult classic in the horror genre. Conversely, its sequel was met with negative reception with criticism directed towards its inferiority to the original, while making much less monetary gain. Alternatively, some critics have positively reviewed the movie with the statement that it too deserves a cult following, stating in elaboration that where the first film was a tribute to 1970s horror films, the second film was meant to replicate the scares of the 1980s.\n\nThe series will continue in the 2024 with the release of a standalone sequel trilogy of films with The Strangers: Chapter 1, Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.\n\nFilm\n\nThe Strangers (2008) \n\nAfter attending their friend's wedding reception, James Hoyt and Kristen McKay, a young couple, whose relationship is in trouble, stop at Hoyt's secluded summer home for the night. In the midnight hours as the couple discusses their future and are attempting to sort out their differences, a knock comes at the door. When they answer a woman asks for someone who does not live there. As time passes by, she persistently repeats the process. As the couple begin to question her intentions, things quickly escalate as the vacation home is taken under siege by three psychopathic masked strangers. The trio of assailants terrorize the couple through the night, while James and Kristen fight to survive. As they work together, they try to determine what these invaders want, and search for an escape before its too late.\n\nThe Strangers: Prey at Night (2018) \n\nTen years after the events of the first movie, Mike and his wife Cindy plan a family getaway. Striving to bond with their troubled teenage children, Luke and Kinsey, the couple plan to visit some relatives in Kalida, Ohio before the latter goes away to boarding school. Arriving at their destination, deserted mobile home park, the family discusses their plans for their stay. In the dead of night, their discussion is interrupted with a knock at the door of the trailer home they rented. Upon answering, a woman asks for someone that is not there with them. As the night continues, she relentlessly continues the process. Just when they begin to question the woman's intentions, three masked serial killer strangers begin to torment and hunt the family members. Frantically making their way to their relatives' home, they discover the couple to be murdered. With no escape, the family must work together despite their differences, as they fight to stay alive.\n\nThe Strangers: Chapter 1 (2024) \n\nIn August 2022, producer Roy Lee announced that three sequels would consecutively enter production beginning in September of that year. The trilogy will be a joint-venture production between Lionsgate Films and Frame Film, and will be distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Principal photography for the trilogy of sequels began concurrently in Slovakia, with production wrapping on all three movies by November 2022. In October 2023, the official titles of the three new movies were announced. \n\nDirected by Renny Harlin, with a script written by Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland; the plot centers around a young woman (Madelaine Petsch) as she drives across-country with her long-time boyfriend (Froy Gutierrez) to start a new life together in the Pacific Northwest. When their car breaks down in Venus, Oregon, the couple is forced to rent an isolated Airbnb for the night. Through the night, they fight to stay alive as three masked strangers terrorize their stay. Harlin stated that the trilogy was intended to be neither a remake nor reboot, and that the tone was going to be close to the first movie. The filmmaker also stated that it would explore who the killers are and where they come from.\n\nThe Strangers: Chapter 2 (2024) \n\nThe second film of an intended trilogy of sequels, was filmed consecutively with the previous movie. Directed by Harlin, with Petsch reprising her role, the plot will follow the events of previous film; while the story will expand in \"new and unexpected ways\". Produced by Lionsgate Films, it will be distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Principal photography wrapped on the project, in November 2022.\n\nThe Strangers: Chapter 3 (2024) \n\nThe third and final installment of the trilogy of sequels, entered principal photography concurrently with the previous two installments. Harlin directed the project with Petsch reprising her role, and the story concluding the plot-line of the trilogy. The film was produced by Lionsgate Films, and will be distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. Production wrapped in November 2022.\n\nFuture\nIn October 2023 at the New York Comic Con, Harlin stated that there are plans to develop additional films beyond The Strangers Trilogy. The filmmaker acknowledge that the trilogy culminates one cohesive story, while the plot may continue afterward. He later stated that the ending of Chapter 3, intentionally has a cliffhanger ending to homage the final scene of the original film, but also to set up future installments.\n\nPrincipal cast and characters\n\nAdditional crew and production details\n\nReception\n\nBox office and financial performance\n\nCritical and public response\n\nIn other media\n\nMusic video \n\nThe music video for the single \"Withorwithout\" by indie pop-rock band Parcels, was released in October 2018. Based on The Strangers film series, the video was directed by Benjamin Howdeshell, with a script he co-wrote with Mike Doyle. The plot of the video clip follows a similar premise to the films. Milla Jovovich and Carsten Nørgaard star as the couple whose home is invaded, while members of the band: Jules Crommelin, Patrick Hetherington, Noah Hill, Anatole Serret, and Louie Swain portray the home assailants. The music video includes a plot twist at the end, revealing that the wife is responsible, having faked a home invasion and murdered her husband.\n\nIt was later revealed that it was Jovovich's idea to turn the plot around with the reveal that the whole story had been in her character's head, serving as her alibi to the law enforcement. The actress, who served as executive producer stated that her parent-instincts would did not like the concept of the band being the real killers. Explaining that they are \"sweet boys\", she stated: \"I [told them], 'I should be the killer.’ I'm sort of known for that anyway and by the way, it would take a lot more than five boys to break into my house. I felt like this could be a really interesting springboard.\" With the release of the single's music video, renowned artist Laurent Melki created a movie poster similar to the work he has completed before, with the artist saying: \"...I imagined this poster as being that of a horror film and I illustrated it as I would have done for a \"Freddy\" or a blockbuster from the time when movie posters reflected an artist's imagination...\"\n\nThe music video received praise from horror critics, and received attention from producers of the film series as well. Shortly after its release, producer Roy Lee approached Howdeshell with the idea of creating a feature-length film based on the video. The filmmaker alongside Doyle began writing a script that they pitched to the associated studios. Jovavich expressed interest in reprising her role from the music video. Speculation arose in September 2022, that one of the three sequels being made, may be based on the concept.\n\nIn other films \nThe same record player scrub of Gillian Welch's \"My First Lover\", which was first used in The Strangers (2008) when the character Kristen first sees one of the intruders wearing a mask, is sampled as an \"infinitely creepy record loop on the radio\" in the 2009 British found footage analog horror short film No Through Road from Steven Chamberlain. It was additionally used during the last episode of his subsequent 2011–2012 sequel web series, with the music first briefly playing on the radio before repeating at the end of the film as a similarly-masked man (portrayed by Chamberlain) slowly approaches four teenagers sitting in a car.\n\nThe titular characters of The Strangers make cameo appearances in the 2012 metafictional horror comedy film The Cabin in the Woods from Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon, portrayed by uncredited stand-ins, as some of the various populates released from the monster cells at the end of the film, subsequently seen burning a trio of security guards on the CCTV monitors.\n\nReferences \n\n \nAmerican film series\nSlasher film series\nFilm series introduced in 2008", "unikey": "The Strangers (film series)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Films", "Principal_cast_and_characters", "Additional_crew_and_production_details", "Reception", "In_other_media", "References"], "contents": ["### The Strangers (2008)\nAfter attending their friend'swedding reception, James Hoyt and Kristen McKay, a young couple, whose relationship is in trouble, stop at Hoyt'ssecludedsummer homefor the night.

night begins with the message that the film youre about to see is based on true events but how much of what made its way on screen actually happened in real life well if youre having nightmares about murders at neonlit pools and flaming trucks youll be happy to know all that stuff is fiction actually the events that inspired the strangers prey at night are the same as the events that inspired writerdirector bryan bertinos the strangers meaning that the only thing based on true events about prey at nightis that the general idea of strangers committing random crimes was loosely based upon a true event from bertinos own childhood  as well as an infamous string of reallife murders that shocked america bertino explained around the time of the strangers release as a kid i lived in a house on a street in the middle of nowhere one night while our parents were out somebody knocked on the front door and my little sister answered it at the door were some people asking for somebody who didnt live there we later found out that these people were knocking on doors on the area and if no one was home breaking into the houses another source of inspiration for bertino was the reallife manson family murders of 1969 wherein sharon tate and friends were brutally slaughtered in tates home i was thinking about thetate murdersand realizing that these detailed descriptions had painted a story of what it was like in the house with the victims but none of the victims knew about the manson family or why it was happening to them bertino once noted so i got really fascinated with telling the victims tale and not filling it in with an fbi profile and not filling it in with finding out that somebodys grandmother beat them and now they want to kill everybody you read obituaries every day where someone is killed for a random reason yes we may eventually find out why but sometimes they dont the randomness of the manson murders combined with bertinos childhood experience formed the basis of what became the strangers ten years later those same two inspirations helped formthe strangers prey at night a reboot of bertinos premise prey at night director johannes roberts just told metro bryan bertino who wrote the screenplay actually had the same exact things happen to him in terms of the girl coming up to the house and knocking at the door then there were all these burglaries around his house then he mixed that in with the charles manson stuff thats really where all of the inspiration came from for him brian wrote the first one too and they are both the same sort of event the specific events of prey at night well theyre entirely fiction so sleep tight oh and if someone knocks at your door maybe dont answer it related topicsfeaturedthe strangersthe strangers prey at night

a good suspenseful horror film in the rt consensus you may have read the following the strangers provides a few scares but offers little else to distinguish itself from other slasher films and while i have a few critiques of this film myself which keep it from being better i do not agree with this consensus this slasher distinguishes itself with its premise weve probably all feared experiencing a break in while in the house some crazed serial killer coming in to kill us right where we are supposed to feel the safest this film exploits this it goes from a stranger knocking on the door late at night disturbing a notsohappy couple to three strangers inevitably hunting this couple down these villains have micheal myers power which as i mentioned in my review of the hitcher is the antagonists ridiculous ability to appear disappear at will and to generally know just exactly where their victim is the failed catchings  life spares are simply there to fill in the 90 minutes with all that said its a minor annoyance and this is a pretty good film otherwise not the most unique horror film youll ever see but rightfully its own piece enjoy it for what it is its well done show less show more

list tomb raider sherlock gnomes the strangers prey at night and love simon were at best midlevel hits domestically worse still only the last one earned good reviews fortunately the film is good enough that the dvd bluray combo pack or 4k ultra hd combo pack is worthy as pick of the week more home market releases for may 22nd 2018 may 23rd 2018 black panther came out on dvd bluray combo pack or 4k ultra hd combo pack last weekend and it is still scaring away a lot of the competition thats not to say there are no new releases that are worth picking up in fact a fantastic woman i kill giants and early man are all contenders for pick of the week in the end that title went to early man on bluray more weekend wrapup march 20th 2018 as predicted black panther remained in first place on the weekend chart tomb raider had an okay opening in second place while i can only imagine was the biggest positive surprise of the weekend love simon had a solid opening especially compared to its production budget the less said about 7 days in entebbe the better overall the weekend box office was down 48 from last weekend to just 132 million this is 49 lower than this weekend last year a 49 decline usually only happens when there is a misalignment in holidays but in this case its due to beauty and the beasts debut 2018 is still ahead of 2017 albeit by a fraction of last weeks lead at just 66 million or 28 in fact with a margin of just 246 billion to 239 billion it is very likely 2018 will lose its lead before the next weekend begins more weekend wrapup black panther and wrinkle in time have recordbreaking weekend march 13th 2018 for the first time ever the top two films at the weekend box office were both directed by africanamerican directors thats amazing and should be the big story unfortunately for a wrinkle in time the big story is black panthers continued box office dominance as that film earned first place over wrinkle with 4082 million to 3312 million disney should be happy with both results the only other new release that didnt bomb was the strangers prey at night which earned third place with 1040 million which is excellent for a lowbudget horror movie the less said about the hurricane heist and gringo the better overall the box office fell 83 from last weekend to 138 million compared to this weekend last year the box office fell 16 yeartodate 2018 has earned 227 billion which is still 83 or 170 million ahead of 2017s pace that lead could be cut in half by this time next week more weekend estimates black panther bests wrinkle in time in disney vs disney battle march 11th 2018 a wrinkle in time got out the gate a little more slowly than hoped for this weekend and disney is projecting an opening weekend of 333 million as of sunday morning thats actually in line with our prediction on thursday of just under 35 million but well below what prerelease interest in the film would have made seem possible that relatively subdued debut left the door open for black panther which will pick up another 411 million this weekend to top the chart and continues breaking records more friday estimates wrinkle tops panther for a limited time march 10th 2018 a wrinkle in time earned first place on friday with 1021 million which was enough for first place over black panther by a small margin unfortunately this lead likely wont last long as the films reviews are only 42 positive and it only managed a b from cinemascore this is the best scores among the new releases this weekend but not good for a family film and will hurt its legs look for a 33 million opening weekend more thursday night previews timely start for wrinkle march 9th 2018 a wrinkle in time opened with 13 million during its previews this might seem like a low amount however it is a live action family film and those tend to struggle during previews but bounce back during the weekend for example paddington 2 only managed 325000 during its previews but it went on to make 11 million during its opening weekend a wrinkle in time wont have the same legs because its reviews are mixed that said it has a shot at first place with 35 million or more which is in line with what we predicted more weekend predictions is it time for panther to relinquish top spot march 8th 2018 there are four wide releases coming out this week but only one of them a wrinkle in time has a shot at dethroning black panther only one other the strangers prey at night has a shot at the top five the other two gringo and the hurricane heist are just hoping to not embarrass themselves this weekend last year the top two movies earned nearly 100 million this year the top five likely wont earn that much 2018 will lose the yearoveryear comparison but hopefully it will be close more 2018 preview march march 1st 2018 february was an amazing month thanks mainly to black panther but fifty shades freed and peter rabbit were also significant hits and overall the month was a massive improvement over last february looking forward theres nothing opening in march that will earn as much in total as black panther did during its opening weekend that said a wrinkle in time and ready player one should have no trouble getting to 100 million while tomb raider has a 5050 chance of getting there unfortunately compared to last march this is still a pittance theres a chance that no film opening this march will earn as much in total as beauty and the beast opened with last march we will need black panther to have good legs to keep 2018 ahead of 2017 by the end of the month more the strangers

collections great movies chazs journal contributors reviews the strangers prey at night mark dujsik march 09 2018 tweet powered by justwatch ten years is a long gap between a movie and its sequel especially for a horror movie that gap though seems as if it was enough time for the filmmakers of the strangers prey at night to get it right the 2008 original written and directed by bryan bertino never quite had the courage of its convictions until its bleakbeyondbleak ending the problem though was that the ending came out of nowhere here was another homeinvasion movie in which it seemed as if the villains were simply pranking a couple for an extended period of time one of the victims of the invasion was the only one to kill anyone until the climax when the masked antagonists revealed their true natures in the final minutes it came across as a shock in the worst possible way advertisement in theory the ending was chillingthe idea that this trio of people didnt have any rational motive any supernatural characteristics or when the time came any scruples in killing their victims in practice it felt cheaptacking on a hopeless ending just to make us feel bad bertino returns as a coscreenwriter this time leaving the directorial work to johannes roberts who brings a far surer hand and a more striking visual aesthetic to the sequel so much of the success of any given horror film relies on a few aesthetic elements its atmosphere its ability to play with light and the shadow and of course location location locationas real estate folks would add for effect from the start a prologue that breaks its predecessors strange sense that the killers might just be toying with their victims this is a visually oppressive exercise in terror save for a few scenes in a brightly sunlit suburb the film remains that way for the extent of its running time thanks to the original we know by now that the three strangers played by damian maffei emma bellomy and lea enslin who wear ironic masks or a hood with painted smiles mean business the neat thing about this sequel is that it stands on its own we dont need to know from the ending of the original movie that these people are heartless coldblooded killers they get to work almost immediately in this outing pulling up to an occupied trailer home in an otherwise empty trailer park in their beatup pickup trucka peppy pop tune blaring on the radio roberts has that song play over the production logos and a black screen but as soon as the film proper starts it cuts out with a jolt as we take in the dim streetlightlit scene as with the original a few knocks on a door at an ungodly hour of the night starts off a brief if genuinely creepy opening the rest of the story follows a likable family of four father mike martin henderson mother cindy christina hendricks daughter kinsey bailee madison and son luke lewis pullman theyre on their way to that trailer park for a weekend trip before taking kinsey to a boarding school theres tension between the family members naturally the parents are worried about their daughter in slightly different ways mike is a bit out of the loop but knows something is amiss and cindy was in a similar place during her own teenage years kinsey resents her parents decision as well as her brothers standing as the perfect child luke clearly thinks his younger sister is a nuisance but he wishes for a return to the days when kinsey was his little sister advertisement its a little surprising how well bertino and fellow screenwriter ben ketai fit in scenes to help flesh out these relationships before the terror truly begins and even more surprisingly during the height of it the height of the terror by the way is a near constant once it starts the film doesnt stop for these moments theyre built into the rising tension as the family separates and slowly comes to realize that they arent alone in the park and they raise the impact of what could have been straightforward sequences of the killers hunting down the assorted family members trapping them in enclosed spaces and getting to their bloody work two stand out an intense scene of lastsecond escape in a cramped bathroom and a parent offering a child what might be some final words even more vital to the film as a thriller we have a sense that unlike the protagonists in the original these characters have an actual chance against the killers all of this heightens the uneasiness because we like these characters enough in their own unique ways theyre good enough that we havent even arrived at roberts technique yet its impressive on a technical level with the director and cinematographer ryan samul utilizing some lengthy preternaturally precise zooms a shot that starts dozens of feet away gets into almostcloseup while still keeping an actor in frame its even more effective in how well roberts incorporates the seemingly vast expanse of this location for a series of genuinely scary sequences the trailers are tight spaces where any of the killers could be hiding in the shadows or beneath some kind of cover one will instantly notice the absence of the usual buildup and sting cues on the soundtrack meaning that were never quite certain when the scare will arrive the fields of the park provide enough sporadic light and distance that we can barely spot a figure or the headlights of that damned truck standingand then approachingfrom afar theres a virtuoso sequence at a pool that opens with a subversion of roberts and samuls usually slow zooms the sequence just keeps going from there as one of the characters engages in a lifeordeath fight with an axwielding maniac on the edge of and in the water the strangers prey at night is an unexpected anomalya sequel that both is better than and fixes the problems of its predecessor its a chilling and genuinely frightening horror film driven by some solid performances and roberts command of atmosphere location and relentless pacing

go for this instead a surprising sequel that may suffer from poor characterizations and characters making dumb decisions of course but does a nice job keeping us tense and invested while making welcome references to the horror genre show less show more super reviewer dec 30 2018 nates grade d show less show more nathan z super reviewer oct 25 2018 i liked a lot of things in this movie that i didnt expect to and i disliked a lot of the things i thought id be on board with averaging out for a pretty midling experience i didnt love the strangers prey at night but i was into it enough that id watch it again some day show less show more super reviewer oct 14 2018 have i reviewed a home invasion movie in this annual horror fest yet oh yea better watch out but thats kind of an inverse home invasion in that the the person doing the invading is a person that actually lives in the home the film takes place in regardless lets move on shall we i wonder if this movie initially started as a sequel to the original the reason i say this is that ive seen a few movies that supposedly were sequels to a horror movie that had nothing in common with the original movie except that they shared the same name with a number at the end of it or in this case a subtitle what they did they took a generic script make some slight adjustments so it can maybe fit into the same universe as the original and just slap the same name onto it quarantine 2 for example took place on a plane and had absolutely very little to do with the original movie which was a remake of rec a tremendous horror movie mostly this is done for purposes of pure greed a horror movie was successful but a sequel wouldnt exactly do great business in theaters so they just threw some bucks at some aspiring filmmakers and had them produce a quick and cheap sequel that they could through dvd rentals or vod make their money back on because they cashed in on the name of a successful horror movie thats what a lot of directtovideo horror sequels end up feeling like so it makes me wonder though if im being fair there was a sequel being planned for this movie shortly after the release of the original over ten years ago apparently it had a very troubled development period and the film is cowritten by the writer of the original movie so this is a true blue sequel having said that i saw the original over ten years ago and i had mixed thoughts i remember really liking how they built some of the tension like when unbeknownst to liv tylers character one of the strangers appears from the dark and just stands behind her while she is in the kitchen but i also remember thinking that it didnt really do anything new or that exciting but to be fair id also be willing to give the original another shot to see if i feel any differently about it lets move on to this movie shall we if im being honest taking everything into consideration and my score for the original movie i actually really liked this movie perhaps not enough to say that its a really good movie because its not but it is a fun slasher that hearkens back with a wink and a nod to the 80s slasher ill give them credit in that while theres very minimal character development as the attack by the strangers is going on the movie does do a good job at setting up its heroes cindy mike and their children luke and kinsey are on a family road trip to their relatives trailer park before kinsey is sent off to boarding school for some apparent behavioral issues they establish the characters their personalities and their motivations again its not like its any great shakes and once again it isnt used to explore the issues that exist in this family but they do at least give the characters something to make them feel more than just bodies to be slaughtered by the strangers so i have to give them props for at the very least attempting to make you care about the characters they could have just as easily had us be completely indifferent to them and their plight and they didnt as i mentioned however the movie is tribute and a satire of 80s slashers some people and reviewers criticized the movie for its reliance of cliches and genre tropes and to me these people seem to be missing the point because umm the point that theyre missing is the point of the movie i think that the cool 80s soundtrack helps to set this satirical mood its used to take you back to that time and those movies but its also used to create a nice contrast here you have these poppy and innocuous 80s songs being used as the backdrop to the strangers attempted slaughter of this entire family the film gets the tone and the atmosphere right because while this trailer park is relatively large theres still a sense of claustrophobia given that no matter what this family does they always seem to be playing right into the strangers hands theyre everywhere at all times which of course is another nod to 80s slashers the acting is more than solid all around bailee madison is quite underrated and really its not like she gets to show much of her range here but shes very good regardless in short the movie is fun to watch particularly late at night and with a good of friends this is just that kind of movie thats not to say that it isnt without its flaws while it is a wink and a nod to a mostly bygone era of horror the movie isnt exactly as clever or as subversive as it might fancy itself to be im not saying that this movie thought it was cabin in the woods or anything like that it doesnt have those ambitions but i do think that it might rely too much on that cleverness instead of attempting to do something that feels fresh and clever partly i do believe that its adherence to 80s slasher tropes also ended up limiting what it could do in the long run with its story its characters and its world but at the same time thats also part of what makes it a fun movie so youre damned if you do and damned if you dont i guess its not really that much of an issue at least for me since i again had a fun time watching this movie and i think that some of the negative reviews sort of missed the point of what the movie was going for though im sure some people knew what the movie was and they still legitimately didnt like it thats perfectly fine everyone is obviously entitled to think what they want about any movie they see regardless while its not perfect this is a fun horror movie i would recommend it if you have prime want something thats not too long and easy to enjoy particularly with a group of friends show less show more jesse o super
