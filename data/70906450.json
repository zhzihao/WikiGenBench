{"id": 70906450, "key": "2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20final%20chaos", "text": "Prior to the 2022 UEFA Champions League final between English team Liverpool and Spanish team Real Madrid on the evening of 28 May 2022, crowd control descended into chaos at the entrances to the Stade de France in the suburb of Saint-Denis, France.\n\nWith a large build-up of fans around the stadium unable to gain access to the stadium in the hours prior to the scheduled kick-off time of 21:00 CET, French police used tear gas and pepper spray on Liverpool fans. These actions were later defended by organisers UEFA and several French political figures, who accused supporters of Liverpool, of whom tens of thousands had travelled to the city, of disorderly conduct, including attempting to gain access to the stadium with counterfeit tickets and penetrating the stadium illegally. This led to the game beginning 36 minutes behind schedule, and resulted in dozens of arrests and hundreds of injuries.\n\nSeveral supporters, journalists, and political figures disputed the initial story of fan disorder. They accused the organisers and security of major disorganisation and unpreparedness. A full enquiry has been commissioned by UEFA. The report, which was published on 13 February 2023, stated that UEFA bore primary responsibility for the organisational and safety failures in the run-up to the match. The report criticised both the organisation and the French police, and rejected claims by both that only ticketless fans were to blame for the chaos. The report stated that there was insufficient evidence for asserting the validity of such claims, and that with these claims both UEFA and French authorities made 'a reprehensible attempt to avoid responsibility'.\n\nPre-match\n\nTicketing\nLiverpool received a ticket allocation of 19,618, equating to 26.1% of the capacity of the Stade de France, with Real Madrid receiving a similar allocation of approximately 20,000. 12,000 were sold to the general public, and another 23,000 retained by UEFA to be distributed to \"the local organising structure, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters\". Liverpool supporters union Spirit of Shankly wrote an open letter to UEFA, criticising them for both the ticket allocation and the \"exorbitant\" prices, and received support from Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who accused UEFA of focusing only on money and not on the supporters, and of hypocrisy for increasing their ticket price over the years while they condemned 'the greed' of clubs such as Liverpool who attempted to form a European Super League, in the context of tense relations between several top European football clubs, including Liverpool, and UEFA following the unsuccessful Super League formation attempt, and encouraged supporters to travel to Paris regardless of whether they had a ticket.\n\nUEFA had requested that the sale of any paper tickets carry holograms. The Real Madrid paper tickets carried holograms while Liverpool F.C. declined to put holograms on their allocation of tickets. Tickets sold by UEFA were delivered electronically through the official UEFA Mobile Tickets app.\n\nLiverpool F.C. required purchasers of its allocation of tickets to either collect from Anfield or pay a Special Delivery at a charge of £12.59 per booking. In the week before the Final, there were reports of ticketing fraud in the British media and Liverpool FC called on social media companies to close more than 50 social media accounts involved in the sale of fake tickets.\n\nTicketing issues only impacted Liverpool fans. However, estimates of the extent of the ticketing problems associated with Liverpool's allocation varied widely. According to the Agence France-Presse, at least 2,800 fake tickets were detected at the stadium gates while the French Football Federation said that 35,000 people with fake tickets or with no tickets eventually showed up at the stadium. Paris police prefect Didier Lallemant said there was a large-scale ticket fraud operation, of \"30,000 to 40,000 tickets\", though this number was alleged to be 2,589 by The New York Times. Some Liverpool supporters that had bought bona fide tickets said they were refused entry. Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said a friend of his was denied entry using an official ticket given by Robertson. 2,700 ticket holders who were refused entry were to be given refunds. Additionally, each club had a designated \"fan zone\" for supporters travelling to the city; Liverpool's was situated in Cours de Vincennes, seven miles away by train, during a railway strike, while Real Madrid's was in Parc de la Maison d'éducation de la Légion d'honneur, within walking distance. Over 7,000 police were on duty in the fan zones and the stadium. Madrid fans entered the stadium from the north, and were directed to arrive by metro, tram or by foot, from their nearby fan zone. The Liverpool fan zone was 10km from the stadium, and calibrated to welcome 44,000. A later estimate however indicated that the number of supporters that came at the fanzone may possibly have raised to approximately 50,000, exceeding the capacity of the zone.\n\nStewardship\nLiverpool fans were supposed to approach the stadium from train stations to the west and south of the stadium. They were directed to arrive on rail lines RER B and D. However the B line was running a partial service due to a strike. A larger than expected number of Liverpool supporters took the D line, which was also on a direct route from their fan zone.  \n\nStewards on the outer perimeter were largely organised to check Liverpool ticket holders coming from the B line. However a large number of supporters came from the D line station. Stewards on the route set out for supporters coming from the D line station were in insufficient number and quickly overwhelmed. Liverpool fans were able to access the turnstiles at the immediate perimeter of the stadium, quickly leading to overcrowding and tension. Moreover the approach was through a narrow enclosed pathway that quickly become clogged up as a dense crowd formed.\nThe police requested that the stewards remove their controls at this point, for safety reasons. As a result, Liverpool fans were able to access the turnstiles at the immediate perimeter of the stadium, quickly leading to overcrowding and bottlenecks. With stewards unable to cope, many Liverpool supporters had great difficulties entering the stadium, even with valid tickets with codes that had not already been presented.\n\nGates at one point were closed entirely, with many supporters still waiting outside. Police used tear gas and pepper spray on supporters outside the stadium. By 21:00 local time, the originally scheduled kick-off time, thousands of seats remained empty in the Liverpool end. For \"security reasons\", the kick-off was initially delayed by 15 minutes to 21:15. This was further delayed by 15 minutes to 21:30, before being pushed back another 6 minutes to 21:36, eventually started at 21:37.\n\nLiverpool Echo reported that \"senior officials from Liverpool officially requested for the kick-off to be delayed after lobbying UEFA\" but \"a UEFA statement released during the game...claimed that supporters who 'had purchased fake tickets' were the reason why\".\n\nMerseyside Police officers, deployed at Stade de France \"reported the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner, arriving at turnstiles early and queuing as directed\".\n\nInside the stadium, messages on the public address system and the jumbotron attributed the delay to the \"late arrival of fans\"; Sky Sports News chief reporter Kaveh Solhekol disputed this, noting he arrived to the ground four hours before kick-off and was \"quite shocked at how early supporters had turned up\". Some of the journalists attending the match attributed the difficulties outside the stadium to the organisers. In a later statement, French police said \"people attempted to penetrate the stadium\", and that police had \"intervened to push back people trying to force their way through\", and blaming fans with \"fake tickets\" who were unable to enter through the turnstiles. \n\nAccording to Football Supporters Europe (FSE) board member Pierre Barthulemy, the head of the French Interior Ministry's Anti-Hooligan Division, Thibaut Delaunay, was not present because he was visiting Qatar to assist with the organisation of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nPost-match\nFollowing the match, large groups of thugs attacked, mugged, and robbed both sets of supporters, actions which were strategically organised by the perpetrators. Eye-witnesses said gangs of youths were \"roaming around outside\" the stadium waiting for fans to leave following the full-time whistle. French police arrested 68 people in total, while a reported 238 people received medical attention. MMA fighter Paddy Pimblett who was at the match compared the events after the game to scenes from the American dystopian film The Purge, alleging that there were \"large groups of men armed with machetes, knives, bars and bats\". According to the testimony of a police officer in Le Figaro, there was mass sexual assault. The secretary of Liverpool's disabled supporters' group told BFM TV that he saw the sexual assault of a disabled young woman.\n\nResponse\n\nClubs\nImmediately after the match, Liverpool requested a formal investigation into the causes of the issues. Liverpool chief executive officer Billy Hogan described the stadium entry and security issues, in addition to the treatment of supporters, as \"absolutely unacceptable\", said accusations being aimed at Liverpool supporters were \"deeply hurtful\", and continued to defend the behaviour of Liverpool supporters. By 31 May, the club had received over 5,000 responses after requesting experiences and issues encountered.\n\nOn 3 June, Real Madrid followed suit, requesting that \"what were the reasons that motivated that designation of the venue for the final and what criteria were taken into consideration taking into account what was experienced that day\", and \"answers and explanations to determine who were those responsible for leaving the fans unattended and defenceless\", highlighting that video evidence showcased fans being \"assaulted, harassed, mugged and robbed with violence\". Former Liverpool player, Jason McAteer said that his wife and son had been attacked and robbed after the game with his wife’s blouse being ripped open and her watch stolen. His son was kicked and his phone stolen.\n\nFans\nThe tactics and actions of the French police were heavily criticised due to their similarity to the events of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in which police incompetence in crowd control contributed to a human crush that claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans. Several family members of Hillsborough victims who were in attendance at the final also compared the response of the police after the match to the response of South Yorkshire Police after the Hillsborough disaster; after Hillsborough, the then-prevailing narrative that drunken Liverpool fans were to blame was fostered by the police in concert with sympathetic journalists and politicians. Survivors of the Hillsborough disaster who also attended the final in Paris reported having their trauma triggered by the \"mayhem\" on display.\n\nFormer Liverpool players Kenny Dalglish, Robbie Fowler, Jim Beglin, and Jamie Carragher reported first and second-hand experiences which were highly critical of UEFA, the French police and Parisian locals. Ronan Evain, executive director of the FSE, condemned the comments, saying \"there is a cheap, very old prejudice against Liverpool fans, and I think it has been used for political gain by the French government.\"\n\nOn 3 June, UEFA issued an apology to all of the Liverpool and Real Madrid supporters who \"had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events\".\n\nPolitical\nBritish Labour Party MP Ian Byrne described the entrance as \"one of the worst experiences\" in his life due to the \"horrendous security and organisation putting lives at risk\". The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss called for a full UEFA inquiry into how the chaos was allowed to unfold. Joanne Anderson, the Mayor of Liverpool criticised the \"appalling management\" of the match and the \"brutal treatment\" of Liverpool fans by the police and stadium officials and called their blaming of the Liverpool fans \"shameful\", comments followed with agreement by Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Nadine Dorries and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Sport, Tourism, Heritage and Civil Society Nigel Huddleston, the latter of which criticised the use of tear gas against young and elderly Liverpool fans.\n\nFrench Sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra and Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin both blamed the problems before the game on Liverpool supporters and their behaviour. This was disputed by reports of supporters from the ground which said it was disorganised and heavy-handed policing, claims that were relayed by British broadcaster Sky Sports, and newspaper The Daily Telegraph. Merseyside Police praised the behaviour of Liverpool fans, describing it as \"exemplary in shocking circumstances\". French politician and Member of the European Parliament Jérôme Rivière stated Darmanin's comments were a \"lie\", pressing him to \"apologise to the British for having wrongly accused them and to the French for the shameful fake news\". Further to her earlier comments, on 30 May Oudéa-Castéra blamed a mass gathering of supporters with fake tickets for the chaos at the stadium.\n\nFrançois-Noël Buffet, the President of the Law Committee, requested that Oudéa-Castéra and Darmanin should show proof for their post-game comments regarding counterfeit tickets. Richard Bouigue, the deputy-mayor of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, was the first French politician to apologise to Liverpool, writing a letter to their supporters' union Spirit of Shankly, in which he said regretted what had taken place. BBC News correspondent Hugh Schofield wrote that the fallout from the final had become an issue in the 2022 French legislative election to be held in June. Right-wing opponents of president Emmanuel Macron portrayed the chaos as stemming from locals from the banlieue of Saint-Denis, a largely immigrant-descent area. French polling expert Jérôme Fourquet mentioned the events from the final as a reason why Macron's Ensemble Citoyens made losses at the elections, and Marine Le Pen's National Rally made large gains.\n\nPolling by Odoxa-Backbone Consulting found that 53% of the French public were apprehensive about France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympics, and that 90% thought that the episode had harmed the nation's reputation abroad.\n\nOn 9 June, the chief of the Paris Police Prefecture, Didier Lallement apologised for the use of tear gas saying that the main aim of the police operation was to save lives. The same day, it was confirmed that the surveillance footage from the stadium of the French Football Federation, had been destroyed as it had not been claimed by the courts within seven days. The French police conserved their own footage however, and handed it over to the courts.\n\nUEFA inquiry\nOn 30 May, UEFA announced they were commissioning an independent report into the events surrounding the final to examine the decision making, responsibility and behaviours of all entities involved, and would be led by Portuguese member of parliament Tiago Brandão Rodrigues on a pro bono basis. The report would be made public upon its completion, with UEFA evaluating the next steps to take.\n\nThe report, which was published on 13 February 2023, found that UEFA bore primary responsibility for the organisational and safety failures in the run-up to the match. The report criticised both the organisation and the French police, and rejected claims by both that ticketless fans were to blame. The report stated that there was insufficient evidence for asserting the validity of such claims, and that with these claims both UEFA and French authorities made 'a reprehensible attempt to avoid responsibility'. UEFA was criticised for marginalising its own safety and security unit, and for statements made during and after the match. The French police were also blamed for  not working with other stakeholders, for failing to prevent or remedy congestion, and for using teargas and pepper sprays without justification. They were also criticised for not acting against local groups who attacked supporters. The report stated that these failures could have caused a mass-fatality crowd disaster.\n\nUEFA General Secretary Theodore Theodoridis accepted the findings of the report, thanking Dr Rodrigues, and offering an apology to those who were affected, particularly the supporters of Liverpool FC 'for their experiences many of them had', and 'for the messages released prior to and during the game which had the effect of unjustly blaming them for the situation'. UEFA also promised to refund all Liverpool fans the cost of their tickets.\n\nSee also\n\nHillsborough disaster\nHeysel Stadium disaster\n2023 Rugby World Cup\n2024 Summer Olympics\n\nFurther reading\n \n Arrêté n° 2022-00519 portant sur la Fan Zone circulation et stationnement Paris (12e 20e) -  Direction régionale de la police judiciaire de la préfecture de police de Paris\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n UEFA Champions League Final 2022: Independent review report \n\nChampions League\nChampions League\nChampions League\nFinal\n2022 controversies\n2022 in Paris\nFrance–Spain relations\nFrance–United Kingdom relations\nEuropean Cup final 2022\nMay 2022 sports events in France\nChampions League final 2022\nSports competitions in Paris\nAssociation football riots\nUEFA controversies", "unikey": "2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Pre-match", "Post-match", "UEFA_inquiry", "See_also", "Further_reading", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["### Ticketing\nLiverpool received a ticket allocation of 19,618, equating to 26.1% of the capacity of theStade de France,with Real Madrid receiving a similar allocation of approximately 20,000.12,000 were sold to the general public,and another 23,000 retained by UEFA to be distributed to \"the local organising structure, UEFA and national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters\".Liverpool supporters unionSpirit of Shanklywrote anopen letterto UEFA, criticising them for both the ticket allocation and the \"exorbitant\" prices,and received support from LiverpoolmanagerJürgen Klopp, who accused UEFA of focusing only on money and not on the supporters, and of hypocrisy for increasing their ticket price over the years while they condemned 'the greed' of clubs such as Liverpool who attempted to form aEuropean Super League, in the context of tense relations between several top European football clubs, including Liverpool, and UEFA following the unsuccessful Super League formation attempt,and encouraged supporters to travel to Paris regardless of whether they had a ticket.\nUEFA had requested that the sale of any paper tickets carryholograms.

liverpool fans preference for printed tickets is likely to be at the root of the industrial scale fraud which caused chaos at the champions league final at the stade de france on saturday may 28 kickoff was delayed by 36 minutes because of disruption at several of the stadiums entrances where liverpool fans waiting in bottlenecks to gain access came into confrontation with the police and tear gas was usedread more france promises in depth inquiry into champions league final chaosthe chaos that unfolded at the stadium has been highly controversial with several members of the french government and state representatives putting the blame on british fans while others denounced the handling of the organisationsome 70 of the tickets circulating were fake said minister of interior gérald darmanin in a press conference today following a crisis meeting at 1100 to discuss the issues which surrounded the organisation and policing of the liverpool fansthe events of saturday evening have also raised questions about frances ability to efficiently organise the upcoming 2023 rugby world cup and the 2024 paris olympicsparis police prefect didier lallemant attributed the disturbance to a largescale ticket fraud operation which generated from 30000 to 40000 tickets in a report provided to mr darmanin and consulted by the agence france presseanybody can duplicate the ticket with the same bar code when it is printed on paper eddie aubin president of my open tickets a consulting cabinet for the ticket industry told the connexionpaper tickets part of british culturethe uefa offered 52000 tickets to football fans for the final of which 20000 were allocated to supporters from both football teams and 12000 to the general public adding on its official faq that no other websites were allowed to sell tickets for the finalmr aubin said buying a sporting ticket event in a paper format was much more common in the uk than in france where digital qrcodes are often used insteadhe added that liverpool had asked uefa to produce the 20000 tickets in paper format since the club was not technically able to handle the blockchain technology used by the uefa for that eventwhile the blockchaintechnology guarantees against attempts at fraud through a complex technological system the production of several thousand paper tickets opens the door to greater risks for black market sales said mr aubina group of liverpool fans were scammed out of 19000  19 tickets bought at 1000 each  when they bought fake champions league final tickets online reported the mirror days before the final adding that 60000 liverpool fans were expected by french officialsdoubts on the actual number of scam ticketsthe 3040000 fake ticket figure suggested by mr lallemant is hard to verify as estimations vary on the number of liverpool fans having got into the stadium or travelled to parismr aubin casted doubts on the number of fake tickets circulating based on the information he gathered without giving a precise number of a range40000 fake tickets means a 20million scam this would have been promoted by an organised crime gang something that i am having difficulty believing

queues and some fans were pickpocketed while they waited david dunne a 58yearold solicitor from formby saw several of the pickpockets standing on the left side of the ramp in front of him some of them were jumping down and joining the queueanyone who tried to escape the huge queue was pushed back by the police two female spanish journalists attempting to reach the accreditation centre were aggressively told to stay where they were gary lineker was caught in the congestion and he has since spoken of his anger in relation to the organisation of a situation which had frightening parallels with the hillsborough disaster according to the merseyside politician ian byrne who was also presentconcern was etched across the faces of older fans women and those travelling with children in the midst of the bottleneck supporters were not given information about where they were heading what they were supposed to do or how long this would last forgeorge bevan was in the queue more than two hours before kickoff a couple of people around me were really panicking he says a young lad had to create some space so he could calm himself down as he was shakenadvertisementbevans auntie made it through the checkpoint but the stewards suddenly stopped letting anyone else in a pressure started to build on the small barriers and this prompted the police to intervene pushing everyone back it was starting to crush says bevan who finally made it onto the stadiums outer concourse via the ramp on the mail de lellipse we were shaking he says it took a while for us to calm downsteve kelly aged 75 was told by the police to use the tarmac of av du president wilson to approach the checkpoint but 50 yards down the road more police had blocked the way through telling him to go back this led to more congestion and he was only able to make it onto the ramp by climbing over a wall a video of others doing the same thing circulating on social media led to suggestions that liverpool fans were trying to bunk in but this was not the case instead it was groups of people attempting to escape a crush ahead of three more rounds of ticket checks once inside the concourse of the stadiumbastien cheval a french journalist arrived at the checkpoint two hours before kickoff a steward he says suggested his ticket was fake and was aggressive with him this prompted him to close the uefa ticket app and reopen it i fear this situation happened to too many hence time being lost and englishspeaking ticket holders getting false informationfiftyfive minutes before kickoff stewards appeared to give up on the first check and steadily supporters were able to pass without having to show their tickets and without being frisked this placed immediate pressure on the nearby gates particularly those immediately in front of the ramp that gave access to the stadium beyond the nowabandoned checkpoint gates y and z where most liverpool supporters were supposed to be accessing the ground were shut and very quickly the crowd and the tension started reaching uncomfortable levels againtwenty minutes before kickoff a notice on the big screens at each end of the stadium announced a delay because of fans arriving late but the photographic and video evidence against this claim is overwhelmingthe mood on the outer concourse of the ground quickly reached choking point john coleman the manager of accrington stanley had arrived at the stade de france three and a half hours before kickoff having flown in from liverpool on the afternoon of the gamefortyfive minutes before the scheduled kickoff however he was remained outside gate b being crushed against a fence he says he was just about to enter through the turnstile when the gate was shut the subsequent buildup of people meant he was unable to move and the pressure was only released when someone else in the crush managed to find a way outadvertisementgeorge bevan who got to his seat three hours after leaving the nearest metro stop to the stadium was held outside gate z where many liverpool fans were entering for longer than two hours everyone in the queue was far calmer than i thought they would be he says i was worried what might happen as we got closer to kickoff the only people regulating the queue and making sure nothing awful happened were fellow fans we had no idea the game was delayeda police officer operating from the same gate told french newspaper lequipe we were lucky that the liverpool fans were patient and calm from his position at nearby gate y however ian burns could see the level of danger increasing there was no queue control on the gate so as more joined the queue became wider and longer some stewarding outside the perimeter directing fans and helping directing fans would certainly have made things a bit calmer making their jobs easierjohn rogers was at gate x it was easy to see it was all going wrong but it was also easy to see why says rogers who has worked at largescale events gates were shut with no information or alternative routes to safely enter the police used an iron fist rather than manage the crowd youd never see glastonbury punters being treated like thisthe failure of the first checkpoint meant that anyone could reach the outer concourse and the gates rogers says he saw a local kid dragged out of the crowd by police before he was peppersprayed the police then started to push the crowd from the backaccording to rafi benmayor a lot of locals were now much closer to the ground without tickets he saw a number of kids trying to jump through the turnstiles only to be turned away the problem was they were not being moved so they stood at the front of the queue holding things upthe buildup of pressure led to stewards closing gates y and z for 20 minutes before reopening them and closing again for another 45 minutes in one of the queues simon bromwell a liverpool supporter says he saw numerous local men with what looked like photographs of tickets sent to their phones via whatsapp burns meanwhile saw police chasing locals over and over again so tensions grew as people were nervous about what might happen if fighting broke outrichard banks a liverpool fan says arguments started when locals started to jump the queues he was five metres away from a gate when the first tear gas was released kids women and old folk were caught in it but we couldnt get away and we still couldnt get in people were in tears a couple had panic attacks one lad was taken away on a stretcher unconsciousadvertisementmark henrydavies a liverpool supporter from wales meanwhile says he saw a fan get through a gate having shown his ticket with minimal fuss before he was hurled to the floor by a policeman a woman who filmed the incident was stopped and the authorities tried unsuccessfully to seize her phone elsewhere a young man was videoed scanning his ticket successfully before being sprayed by a lone policeman i mean seriously what is this fans

teargassing at one point in the panic at the closed gate and with nowhere else to go some fans started rattling an exit gate and this prompted police to raise their weapons but this came and went within the space of 30 secondsdavid coe saw fans fainting vomiting and crying the situation was not much safer in other parts of the ground at gate r close to the madrid end three stewards manned the gate and were letting fans in without checks at gate a meanwhile david dunne experienced a huge crush where a young woman in a real madrid shirt became distressed and started to cry along with another man to his right he tried to protect her from the crowd pressure but it was difficult panic was beginning to set inat the ticket scanning area at gate a the pressure became intense the woman dunne had tried to help became trapped against a metal fence to the right of the machine she could not move and a steward then had to pull her up and over the fence before she became injured he managed to do that just in timedunne who had his phone pinched  he believes as he waited at gate a  thinks a lot of the issues at the gates were caused because the ticket machines would not scan rather than because tickets were forged one liverpool fan having paid 670 for his ticket was not even asked to show it to anyone beyond the first checkpoint that failed later other liverpool fans have claimed they were instead asked for bribes by stewards one video shows a local man getting through a turnstile and bragging that he does not have a ticket while those with tickets were held backnicky kelly 34 had some sympathy with the stewards because many of them seemed to be young but blames the authorities for not having enough experience onsite there were lads stewarding there who were teenagers and didnt know what they were doing or how to deal with it i did stewarding as a young lad you get the minimum wage and its not easy to stand up to an aggressive lad twice your agein a neutral zone a survivor of the hillsborough disaster was trying his best to calm the crowd but he was visibly panicking andy jones a liverpudlian was directed by a steward to jump a turnstile with his son when his ticket didnt work another fan glen gates needed five attempts to scan his ticket it seemed the scanners were not fit for purpose and contributed towards the slow entryadvertisementbanks got to his seat just in time for

decades because of an ms diagnosis three years ago which has reduced her mobilitybecause there were no signs outside the ground i inadvertently went in at the madrid end she says this was disorganised with cursory bag checks and no ticket checks loads of locals got through and i would characterise them as organised gangshalf an hour before the original kickoff time rattigan asked to be lifted out of the queue at gate y intending to wait until the chaos calmed down she never made it inadvertisementi tried three different routes out each of which the police had blocked off as there were running battles with large local gangs she says police were getting bottled and retaliated with tear gas during the hour i was walking around the stadium trying to get to safety hundreds of locals scaled the fences and got into the groundian burns says at 10pm 23 minutes into the game the queue started to move but there were still many nonliverpool fans who were getting to the gates either with tickets that wouldnt scan and others with no tickets at all these people predominantly had french accents they certainly were not liverpool fansafter the final whistle the wide exit gates at section s were closed and this meant thousands of people were forced to use instead a small entry gate at section r potentially causing another crush the same happened at section u where police had closed the gates and fans used m and n as we tried to leave they the police were still pushing us up against the walls says jack bookey a liverpool fanon the concourse immediately outside the stade de france some of the scenes were distressing one man who was sitting on the floor with a woman who was asking for medical assistance was surrounded by three local men as the woman begged in french for help they rooted through his pockets and stole his money he was too spaced out to notice though police were nearby and supporters who had seen the theft asked for help those officers did nothingfrom there the route back to the metro lines did not include any provision for safety the journey back to the centre of paris via passageways that supporters had struggled to navigate several hours earlier were more intimidating now because they were so badly lit here groups of young local men were either waiting or running towards the stadium picking off anyone who strayed from the beleaguered stagger towards the stationsome had their sunglasses swept from their heads others had their phones stolen darwin nearly lost her bag one man in his 30s trying to retrieve his phone gave chase and suddenly found himself surrounded by a gang after emerging from bushes with knives he spent the part of the night in hospital receiving treatment for slash woundsfor paul simpson a liverpool fan from sheffield the worst part of the whole day was now there were local gangs trying to mug liverpool supporters and the police were absolutely not interested he tells the athletic he is not the only person to describe the situation as being like a scene from the purge attacked supporters without receiving assistance from the police tried to defend themselves and the result was carnage children had to witness people getting their heads getting kicked in and the police were not remotely interestedadvertisementmatt roylance headed in the direction of the la plaine rer station which serves paris by faster trains he experienced sporadic intimidation and thieving all the way down as he arrived in the stations forecourt there were a large number of fireworks shot into liverpool fans by locals the gendarmerie stood watching focusing most of their attention on lfc supportersheading in the opposite direction was dan davies to charles de gaulle airport he says the train windows were smashed by gangs of locals the man sitting next to him had his wallet stolen and he caught someone trying to steal his it was the most unsafe ive ever left in my lifeback in the fanzone liverpool fans who had stayed to watch the game in cours de vincennes were teargassed by french police as soon as the final whistle blew supporters reported seeing children spluttering and in distress as they tried to leaveshaun bowden from barry in wales needed to return to his hotel in gennevilliers a 45minute walk from the stadium he was happy to travel by foot but every exit out of the concourse in that direction was blocked by lines of riot police he was ushered in another direction but that exit proved to be blocked as well by police who turned him around before using tear gas completely unprovoked with kids and elderly people amongst usas we turned back around with our eyes streaming and throats burning we were met with a crowd of people coming in the opposite direction who had also been teargassed he says none of us knew where to go i stopped a policeman and asked him which way the exit was as we got gassed one way and then the other way he just smiled and shrugged at meeventually bowden was herded towards a train station where gangs were eyeing up fans and taking advantage of individuals or smaller groupsafter being directed onto a train back into paris the opposite direction to which he needed to go he arrived in gennevilliers two hours later some of the worst scenes were at the porte de paris station where real madrid fans were attacked and for once it seems some police decided to at last

on their entry to the stade de france last night are deeply concerningthe statement issued by uefa shortly before the end of the game  in which real madrid beat liverpool 10  said in the leadup to the game the turnstiles at the liverpool end became blocked by thousands fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstilesthis created a buildup of fans trying to get in as a result

with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player uefa is sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the french police and authorities and with the french football federationstadium authorities initially blamed a delayed kickoff on the late arrival of fans for the

operation before this game was ineffective solhekol concluded it was not done properlystadium authorities blame late arrivals despite hourslong queues an announcement posted on the big screens inside the stade de france initially blamed fans for the kickoff delay with the message reading due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium the match has been delayedbut sky sports news senior reporter melissa reddy countered supporters have been queuing for over two hours outside there are countless witness accounts of how this evening has unfolded amid horrid organisationreddy had already tweeted

the last few minutes me and three of my crew were teargassed for no reason whatsoever by the french police it was a pretty nasty experience but we sorted it out by getting a few bottles of water and pouring it in our eyes we are all finethe situation here is a bit of a strange one i think what has happened is a lot of people have turned up at the stadium without tickets they seem to be young french people just milling around and trying to break through the security cordons please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player former liverpool goalkeeper brad friedel says questions must be asked of uefa and the stade de frances security and safety measures after ugly scenes surrounding the champions league final from what ive seen even at the liverpool fan park the french polices attitude has been very heavyhanded with absolutely zero tolerance they dont care how much of a crush is developing and they are insisting on searching absolutely everybody before they let them throughwe had a situation at the fan park this afternoon where some liverpool fans were queuing up for three hours to get into a free event there were three four five checkpoints where they were being held up and searchedwe had the same situation at the stadium tonight there are so many police riot police and security guards here and their mindset has been to stop anybody without a ticket getting anywhere near the stadiumthe situation is complicated because were not just talking about paper tickets were talking about in the modern age people have passes on their phones they havent been able to bring up the right passes or find their passwords weve seen people in tears because theyve had their tickets swiped from them people have had their electronic tickets stolen from them please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player kaveh solhekol says fans have been left frustrated by delays getting through checkpoints on their way to the champions league final at the stade de france as far as the police and security here are concerned they dont care they dont want anybody near the stadium if they dont have tickets im walking around the streets now and its full of young french people trying to find a way to get inside the security cordoni can only say from what ive seen as an eyewitness myself but i havent seen any liverpool supporters whatsoever causing any problem at all i havent seen them turning up late i was quite shocked at how early supporters had turned up at the stadiumwe got here about four hours before kickoff expecting it to be quite quiet but it felt like it was an hour before kickoff because so many people had arrived early and in good time i would be very wary when i read statements from uefa blaming the kickoff being delayed and the problems outside the stadium on the late arrival of fans that is not the case from what i have seeni have seen quite a few fans trying to trick their way past security guards and the policemen and all of those supporters ive seen trying to do that are spanish it was one of those incidents we got caught up in when we were teargassed a group of riot police were trying to eject some real madrid supporters who were trying to get through the cordon without ticketsthere was a bit of a confrontation between the spanish supporters and the riot police and thats when they got out the tear gas and we happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong timebut i have to stress again  with my own eyes i havent seen any liverpool supporters causing any problems or trouble whatsoevermajority of fans behaved in exemplary manner  merseyside policemerseyside police say they will pass on their observations from last nights champions league final chaos after liverpool requested a formal investigation from uefaofficers from merseyside were deployed in france to work with local officers and they have reported the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary mannerassistant chief constable chris green said our officers returning today will conduct a formal debrief to ensure that we can fully support any subsequent investigation following last nights gamewe know that people would have witnessed a lot of distressing scenes last night and we wish everyone returning home from paris a safe journey our focus today will be supporting liverpool city council with the policing of the homecoming parade
