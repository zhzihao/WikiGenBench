Incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was seeking re-election, after defeating Speaker of the People's Majlis Mohamed Nasheed in the Maldivian Democratic Party primaries.\nPeople's National Congress candidate and Malé mayor Mohamed Muizzu won the election with 54% of the votes, defeating Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and becoming President-elect of the Maldives. It was the fourth consecutive election in which a Maldivian president failed to win reelection, the last to do so having been Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ran unopposed, in 2003.\n\nBackground\nFormer president Abdulla Yameen of the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) had announced his candidacy for president, but due to his sentencing in 2018 to 11 years in prison  for corruption and money laundering due to his connection to the Maldives Marketing and Public Relations Corporation scandal he is ineligible to appear on the ballot. PPM's vice president Mohamed Muizzu purportedly ran on his behalf as a nominee of the PNC, which he also joined before the election. Abdulla Yameen opted to support Muizzu's candidacy after previously calling for a boycott of the election.\n\nFormer Minister of Defence and National Security, Mohamed Nazim of the Maldives National Party announced his candidacy for president. The Jumhooree Party announced that they will put forth candidates as well. Ilyas Labeeb of the newly formed The Democrats nominated himself as a candidate for president. Independents Ahmed Faris Maumoon, son of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, Umar Naseer and Hassan Zameel also announced their candidacies for president. This presidential election had the most recorded candidates since the first direct contested election in 2008, where six candidates participated.\n\nAs no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the first round, the top two finishers, Muizzu and incumbent Solih, moved on to a runoff.\n\nElectoral system\nThe Maldives has a presidential system of government where the president is both the head of state and government. The president is elected via direct-vote every five years and can only be elected for a maximum of two terms, which is the limit allowed by the constitution. The law and constitution of the Maldives grants its citizens the right to vote and run for public office at the age of 18.\n\nIn the elections, the candidate who receives a majority (more than 50%) of the valid votes cast is elected president. If no candidate receives an outright majority, the election then proceeds to a runoff (or second round), which are mandated to be held no less than 21 days following the initial election day between the two front runners. The candidate who receives the majority of the vote is then elected president. The official results are announced by the Elections Commission and published in the government gazette within seven days of the voting day of the presidential elections.\n\nCandidates\n\nMaldivian Democratic Party\nThe Maldivian Democratic Party held primary elections to choose its presidential candidate on 28 January 2023. Nasheed accused Solih of trying to rig the presidential primary. The Chairperson of Maldivian Democratic Party, Fayyaz Ismail, defended the primaries, reiterating that they will be held in accordance with the party constitution.\n\n Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, incumbent president and leader of Maldivian Democratic Party.\n Mohamed Nasheed, incumbent speaker of the People's Majlis, former Maldivian president, former president of Maldivian Democratic Party and leader of Democrats.\n\nProgressive Congress Coalition \nNominated by the Progressive Party of Maldives and People's National Congress.\n\n Abdulla Yameen, former president and leader of Progressive Party of Maldives.\n\nHowever, since the Maldivian Criminal Court sentenced former president Yameen to 11 years in prison, it would be a high chance that Elections Commission would disqualify Yameen in the presidential elections.\n\nNominated by People's National Congress's as a 'Backup' candidacy.\n\n Mohamed Muizzu, Mayor of Malé and former Minister of Housing and Infrastructure.\n\nPNC's president Abdul Raheem said that he would withdraw the candidacy if the Maldivian Supreme Court allowed Yameen to compete in the upcoming elections, which ended up not happening.\n\nThe Democrats \nNominated by The Democrats, a newly formed political party from the rapidly unfolding power struggle between two pivotal figures in the Maldivian Democratic Party — incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih and former president Mohamed Nasheed.\n\n Ilyas Labeeb, Hulhudhoo 19th Parliament Member (MP) of the People's Majlis.\n\nJumhooree Party \nFinalised by Jumhooree Party's council meeting.\n\n Qasim Ibrahim, former Speaker of the People's Majlis and leader of Jumhooree Party.\n\nMaldives National Party \nNominated by Maldives National Party.\n\n Mohamed Nazim, former Minister of Defence and National Security and leader of Maldives National Party.\n\nAhmed Faris Maumoon (independent candidate) \nNominated by himself as an independent candidate.\n\n Ahmed Faris Maumoon, MP for Dhiggaru MP constituency and the son of former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.\n\nUmar Naseer (independent candidate) \nNominated himself as an independent candidate.\n\n Umar Naseer, former Minister of Home Affairs.\n\nHassan Zameel (independent candidate) \nNominated himself as an independent candidate.\n\n Hassan Zameel, former Deputy Minister of Defense.\n\nCampaign\nA key campaign topic was the Maldives' position with respect to China and India. The incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih campaigned on an \"India-first\" policy, aiming to strengthen ties with the Maldives' geographical and cultural neighbour. On the opposite side, Mohamed Muizzu, adopting the slogan \"India out\", called for Indian military personnel stationed on the archipelago to leave, while campaigning for closer relations with China. This kept in line with the policies of former president Abdulla Yameen, founder of the People's National Congress, under whom the Maldives joined China's Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nMuizzu also campaigned on freeing Yameen, at the time serving an 11-year prison sentence for bribery and money laundering, pushing for the former president to be transferred to house arrest. Jailed on the same island where he arrested several of his political opponents, Yameen had requested to be moved home for health reasons two weeks prior to the election's second round.\n\nSecond round \nMuizzu won 46% of the votes in the first round, compared to 39% for Solih. Media sources attributed this result to rivalry between President Solih and former President Mohamed Nasheed, whose chosen candidate Ilyas Labeeb won 7%. As neither Muizzu nor Solih received an absolute majority of the votes cast, a second round was scheduled for 30 September.\n\nUmar Naseer and Ahmed Faris Maumoon did not endorse either candidate for the runoff. Mohamed Nazim endorsed Muizzu. While Qasim Ibrahim asked his supporters to vote as they pleased, his running mate Ameen Ibrahim and his party secretariat endorsed Solih.\n\nResults\n\nReactions\n – Incumbent president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih conceded defeat, congratulating his opponent for his victory, as well as the Maldivian people for participating in a peaceful and democratic process.\n – US.

approximately 39000 of his supporters had been cut from theparty registryin response to this alleged injustice nasheed and his allies including deputy speaker eva abdulla created anew faction within the mdpanticipating potential expulsion by the partys leaders as they openly express their desire towork with the oppositionto unseat the president during the upcoming elections in september this faction has now initiated the formation of a new party the democratsdeputy speaker eva abdulla herself a prominent former member of mdp is assisting nasheed in establishing the new party abdulla along with other nasheed loyalists have left the mdp to join the democrats and are encouraging mdp members loyal to nasheed to do the same the party is yet to be officially registered but is in the process of doing so it has submitted a listexceeding3500 members to the election commission surpassing the 3000member requirement to form a recognized party the elections commission is currently reviewing

potentially modifying the composition of important parliamentary committees nasheed while still technically the mdp leader has not yet officially joined the democrats if he does he would likely become the minority leader especially with ongoing attempts to remove him from his position of speaker of parliamentthe rift between nasheed and solih was formalized in late 2021 earlier in 2021 nasheed narrowly survived anassassination attemptlinked to islamic extremists who targeted him for his socially liberal views after medical treatment in germany he returned to the maldives and advocated for hatespeech legislation to prevent hostile targeting of those accused of insufficient religiosity a dangerous charge in the maldives where religion and nationalism are deeply entwinedwhile initially

to political pressure nasheed circulated anofficial statementexpressing his unwillingness to continue working with solihhowever the tension between nasheed and solih has deeper roots stemming from the

aside to support analternative candidate ibrahim mohamed solihwho eventually won the presidencyafter his terrorism conviction was overturned nasheed made a triumphant return from exile in 2019 he spearheaded his partys campaign in the parliamentary electionssecuring a supermajority victory and assumed the role of speaker nasheed however nurtures ambitions for a higher office stillspecifically that of prime minister a role that would only be possible should the country transition to a parliamentary system his ongoing push for a national referendum to effect this transition most notably during themdp congress in 2022 continues to fuel the tension between him and solih who is staunchly opposed to such a referendumalthough nasheed nominallyremains the mdps leaderhis open alliance with the opposition after a controversial primary cannot endure the mdps parliamentary group has filed a noconfidence motion against both nasheed and deputy speaker abdulla the latter alleges that simultaneous noconfidence motions against both the speaker and deputy create a parliamentary deadlock since neither of them is able to preside over the legislatures proceedings including noconfidence votes abdulla claims this wasdeliberately orchestratedby the government to neutralize the parliaments oversight functions in the upcoming presidential elections by contrast the government claims that
