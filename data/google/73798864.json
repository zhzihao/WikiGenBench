The final report, released recently, sheds light on the events surrounding the mysterious docking of the Russian cargo ship Lady R in Simon’s Town last year, and the subsequent economic and diplomatic fallout.\nIn December 2022, the Lady R unexpectedly docked at the South African Naval Base in Simon’s Town. The controversy was brought on in part by the ship’s abrupt shutdown of its marine tracking system, rendering its presence shrouded in secrecy. The vessel was loaded and unloaded under armed guard, with its arrival and departure leaving both South Africa and the international community baffled as to the purpose and cargo of the vessel.\nSpeculation ran rife, with many questioning whether South Africa was clandestinely supporting Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It took two weeks and persistent queries before Defence and Military Veterans Minister Thandi Modise clarified that the Lady R was, in fact, offloading an old, longstanding order for ammunition. Six shipping containers were reportedly loaded onto the ship before it left, providing some clarity but leaving lingering questions about the nature of the cargo.Advertisement\nIn May, United States’ (US) Ambassador to South Africa Reuben Brigety made the claim that the vessel was indeed loading weapons and ammunition, stating that he would “bet his life” that this was the case.\nThe timing of the Lady R’s arrival was particularly sensitive, given the heightened tensions between Russia and the West over the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. South Africa, despite its policy of supporting a rules-based international order, had refrained from criticizing Russia’s actions, raising eyebrows in Western diplomatic circles.\nThe Lady R incident had profound economic and diplomatic consequences for South Africa. President Cyril Ramaphosa, when announcing the findings of the investigative panel this week, highlighted the damage done, stating: “The allegations leveled against our country had a damaging effect on our currency, economy, and our standing in the world.”\nAfter months of rigorous investigation, the independent panel, chaired by Judge PMD Mojapelo, has concluded its work. The investigation confirmed that the Lady R carried equipment destined for the South African National Defence Force, but that despite the Lady R being under US sanctions, these sanctions were not endorsed by the United Nations and were thus not binding on South Africa. Additionally, no South African entity had a say in the choosing of the Lady R as the delivery vessel, and the goods were offloaded at night due to their classified nature and the security risk posed by daylight exposure. The investigation found no evidence to substantiate claims that weapons were loaded onto the Lady R, confirming only the offloading of equipment.Advertisement\nIn response to the investigation’s conclusion, David Feldmann, Mission Spokesperson at the US Embassy in Pretoria, expressed appreciation for the seriousness with which the inquiry was conducted in a press statement. He reiterated the US’s commitment to advancing progress in various shared priorities with South Africa, including trade, health, and climate. Brigety, as President Joe Biden’s personal representative in South Africa, retained the confidence of the US leadership and remained focused on strengthening bilateral relations.\nThe Lady R incident appears to have come to a close with the release of the investigative panel’s findings. While the economic and diplomatic repercussions were significant, the report has provided clarity on the nature of the cargo and the circumstances surrounding the ship’s docking, and the US and South Africa have both expressed a willingness to move past the incident.SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDAILY UPDATEGet the best of CNBC Africa sent straight to your inbox with breaking business news, insights and updates from experts across the continent.

        "text": "The Minister of Defence alters her account of the Lady R incident\nVisit da.org.zaWhy the DAValues and PrinciplesPoliciesOur PeopleNewsroomWhere we GovernContactCampaignsDonateGet InvolvedMenuNewsroomSpeechesStraight TalkWhere We GovernThe Minister of Defence alters her account of the Lady R incidentIssued by Dianne Kohler Barnard MP – DA Shadow Minister of State Security15 Jun 2023 in NewsNote to editors: Please find attached soundbite by Dianne Kohler Barnard MP.\nDuring a session in the National Assembly, Minister of Defence Thandi Modise initially informed the DA that nothing was loaded onto the Russian cargo ship Lady R. Her claim was therefore that the ship had docked at Simon’s Town, a port without fixed cranes, which were later transported and set up during the night under the surveillance of non-uniformed personnel armed with military-grade automatic weapons. Despite these circumstances, she asserted that nothing was loaded onto the ship.\nHowever, in the latest National Assembly meeting, the Minister changed her narrative. She stated that the Lady R was, in fact, delivering a consignment from Russia, implying that the South African government possessed more knowledge about the ship’s loading and unloading than they have disclosed thus far.\nFurthermore, the Minister speculated about the possibility of a private company potentially utilising the Lady R to transport illegal arms or other contraband destined for Russia. She claimed that all details would be revealed by the Commission of Inquiry, erroneously referring to it as a Judicial Commission of Inquiry. She also contradicted herself regarding Defence Intelligence’s awareness of the foreign-owned ship, stating that they both knew and did not need to know about it since their focus should be outside the country.\nIt is worth noting that the Lady R has been included in the US Treasury’s list of sanctioned Russian vessels and shipping companies since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as it is alleged to be involved in transporting weapons.\nSeveral eyewitnesses, including civilians, have reported seeing items being offloaded from and loaded onto the ship. If indeed weapons were loaded onto the Lady R for use by the Russians in their conflict with Ukraine, it would severely discredit the ANC’s claim of South Africa’s non-alignment.\nThe Minister’s suggestion that a private company may have exported arms to Russia is an extraordinary allegation. If military supplies were indeed loaded onto this Russian ship within a National Key Point without the knowledge of our Defence Force, it would constitute a grave breach of national security. Accountability must be established for all those who may have allowed a naval base to be misused in this manner.\nThe Minister’s recent actions have only served to dig a deeper hole for herself than when she initially evaded questions in December.\nIt is possible that the close relationship between the ANC government and Russia, including social events and joint military exercises, has played a role in these developments.\nHowever, it seems that the Minister has realised that if there is concrete evidence showing South Africa’s involvement in supplying weapons to Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, our country may face sanctions. It is important to recognize that our trade reliance on the EU far exceeds that on Russia, and we greatly benefit from preferential access to US markets through the AGOA treaty.\nComplete and transparent disclosure regarding the activities involving the loading and unloading of the Lady R remains pending. If the government has nothing to hide concerning the Lady R’s docking, their continued evasion in providing a comprehensive account of the events raises questions. The government’s silence on this matter continues to be unsettling.\nBe part of the mission to rescue South Africa, register correctly to vote now atcheck.da.org.za\nLatest NewsDA requests deadline extension for comments ondraft IRP 202319 Jan 2024 in NewsDA requests deadline extension for comments ondraft IRP 202319 Jan 2024 in NewsDA requests deadline extension for comments ondraft IRP 202319 Jan 2024 in NewsThe DA rejects Netanyahu’s recent statements19 Jan 2024 in NewsThe DA rejects Netanyahu’s recent statements19 Jan 2024 in NewsThe DA rejects Netanyahu’s recent statements19 Jan 2024 in NewsSenior Postbank official debunks President Ramaphosa’s lie about social grants19 Jan 2024 in NewsSenior Postbank official debunks President Ramaphosa’s lie about social grants19 Jan 2024 in NewsSenior Postbank official debunks President Ramaphosa’s lie about social grants19 Jan 2024 in NewsStraight Talk: Only DA-style good governance can protect social grants19 Jan 2024 in Straight TalkStraight Talk: Only DA-style good governance can protect social grants19 Jan 2024 in Straight TalkStraight Talk: Only DA-style good governance can protect social grants19 Jan 2024 in Straight TalkReal matric pass rate is 55.3%18 Jan 2024 in NewsReal matric pass rate is 55.3%18 Jan 2024 in NewsReal matric pass rate is 55.3%18 Jan 2024 in NewsOne Nation with One Future built on Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity for All.Contact Details+27(0)21 465 1431InstagramTiktokFacebookTwitterYouTubeEmailView all InfoWhy the DA?HistoryConstitutionPoliciesValues and PrinciplesGet InvolvedDonateDA YouthStudents’ OrganisationDA AbroadDA Women’s NetworkYoung Leaders ProgrammeJobs at the DAJoin the DAPrivacy and Access to Information© 2018–2023 Democratic Alliance | All Rights Reserved | Privacy & Access to InformationDemocratic Alliance, registered non profit organisation in South AfricaReg No: 011-895 NPOPlusPlusMinus"

The Russian vessel Lady R docked at Simon's Town Naval Base near Cape Town, South Africa, in December.AP file PrintSept. 6, 2023, 1:03 PM UTC / Source: The Associated PressBy The Associated PressSouth African officials did not know a sanctioned Russian ship was assigned to deliver military equipment to the country until the vessel was nearing national waters, according to an inquiry into an incident that caused diplomatic tensions between South Africa and the U.S.U.S. Ambassador Reuben Brigety accused South Africa in May of having weapons intended for Russia loaded on to the Lady R when the container ship docked near Cape Town in December. The ship is under U.S. sanctions for ties to a company that transported arms for Russia’s war on Ukraine.South Africa denied there was a government-approved deal to ship weapons to Russia from the country, which officially has taken a non-aligned stance on the Ukraine war. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a three-person panel led by a retired judge to oversee an inquiry into the matter.An executive summary of the panel’s report released Tuesday night stated that the ship offloaded military equipment but no weapons were loaded onto it. The panel also said that South African officials had no say in how the equipment ordered from the United Arab Emirates was shipped.Ramaphosa made the summary public but has said the full report would remain classified. “To reveal the details of the equipment offloaded would compromise important military operations and put our soldiers’ lives at risk,” he said.Brigety asserted during a May news conference that U.S. intelligence showed ammunition and weapons were put on the Lady R in South Africa and carried to Russia. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers subsequently asked the Biden administration to punish South Africa and questioned the country’s ability to receive trade benefits under a U.S. law, the African Growth and Opportunity Act.The secretary-general of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party, Fikile Mbalula, last month openly questioned why Brigety remained in the country after allegedly “lying” about South Africa supplying Russia with weapons.The panel’s findings elicited calls from several quarters, including the ANC-aligned South African Communist Party, for the ambassador to be expelled.“We appreciate the seriousness with which the panel of inquiry undertook to investigate irregularities surrounding the Lady R’s presence in South Africa in December 2022,” David S. Feldmann, a spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, said Wednesday. “The U.S. government shared certain information pertaining to the Lady R and its presence in South Africa in support of the investigation.”According to the inquiry report, the Russian ship was redirected to the Simon’s Town naval base after shipping agents at the Ngqura-Port Elizabeth port, where it intended to dock, refused to service the ship due to the U.S. sanctions.“This only became apparent as the ship was already approaching South African waters,” the panel found, adding that the ship was redirected “to rescue the situation.”The investigating panel accepted the nighttime work to offload the military equipment, saying it was loaded on pallets and would be visible to anybody within site of the Simon’s Town dock. The vessel switched off its identification transponder because it was being tracked by foreign intelligence agencies, the panel said, without naming those agencies.The panel also concluded that the U.S. sanctions were not binding on South Africa because United Nations had not endorsed them.The Associated PressAboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance©2024 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo"
