In response to a question about the potential conflict between those goals, he rejected the idea that there was any tension between eliminating Hamas and saving the hostages. The prime minister warned civilians in Gaza to find safe areas as Israel intensifies its presence in the region. On Friday night, Israel launched a series of bombings in Gaza. Since then, there have been a variety of reports that civilians have lost connection to internet and cellular communication. Gallant spoke on the complications of returning the hostages under Hamas. He said there might be a higher probability of rescuing the abductees as Israel's military pressure escalates, which Gantz emphasized in his own remarks.Earlier on Saturday, a Hamas spokesperson reportedly said in a broadcast on a Hamas-run television channel that the militant group was prepared to return its hostages in exchange for Israel's Palestinian prisoners.— Rebecca PicciottoSat, Oct 28 202312:55 PM EDTSpokesman says Hamas is ready to trade hostages for Palestinian prisonersThe spokesman for the military wing of Hamas says the group is ready to swap dozens of hostages it is holding for all the Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.The spokesman, using the nom de guerre Abu Obeida, said in a televised speech Saturday that such a deal also could be conducted in stages, but that Israelis \"should know the price that they have to pay.\"On Saturday, hundreds of relatives of hostages gathered in a square in downtown Tel Aviv and demanded that the government put the return of their loved ones ahead of Israel's military objectives.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to meet with the hostage families later Saturday.

He added that Hamas would end up using Starlink for \"terrorist activities.\"\"Perhaps Musk would be willing to condition it with the release of our abducted babies, sons, daughters, elderly people.

The page reflects developments in the time period from 7 October 2023 until 7 January 2024.A detailed legal brief on the 2023-2024 hostilities in Israel and Gaza, covering the time period from 7 October until 8 November 2023, can be found here.Background: The situation in Israel-Palestine prior to the 2023-2024 hostilitiesOverviewCasualties\nAs of 7 January 2024 (figures reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health), at least 22,835 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, around 70% of whom were women and children, while around 58,416 others have been injured. Thousands more are feared trapped underneath the rubble, and “entire families” have been wiped out – it is estimated that as of 5 January, 1,876 families have lost multiple family members.\nOn 6 November, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that “Gaza is becoming a graveyard for children”. The New York Times has reported that even according to “a conservative assessment of the reported Gaza casualty figures … the rate of death during Israel’s assault has few precedents in this century”.\nAs of 7 January (figures reported by the Israeli authorities, according to Israeli media), more than 1,200 Israeli and foreign nationals in Israel have been killed, amongst them 36 children; 1,162 of them have been identified by name. Around 5,400 others have been injured.\n174 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 1,023 injured since the beginning of ground operations in Gaza, according to Israeli sources.\nRelease of hostages and prisoners\nOn 22 November, Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary, four-day-long ceasefire and the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza – women and children – in exchange for 150 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons – also women and children.\nThe humanitarian pause entered into effect on 24 November at 7 am local time; it wasextended by two more days on 27 November.\nThe humanitarian pause ended on 1 December at around 7 am local time. Overall, 105 hostages held in Gaza – Israeli and foreign nationals – and 240 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons were released.\nOf the 240 Palestinians who were released, 107 are children aged 14 to 17, and 66 are 18 years old; 68 are women. The New York Times reported that 37 had been detained after the 7 October attacks, and a majority – around three quarters – were never convicted of a crime, which reinforces longstanding concerns about a deeply flawed and discriminatory military justice system in the West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem. An 18-year-old teenager from Qabatiya told Al Jazeera that he was beaten while in detention, which left him “in pain on the floor for a week” without medical assistance; upon his release, he held up his bandaged hands and fingers, covering up multiple fractures.\nOf the 105 hostages who were released, more than 30 are children under the age of 18, five are 18 years old, and over 40 are women. One 84-year-old hostage was hospitalized in critical condition upon her release. First testimonies by the abducted, their families, and medical professionals are beginning to emerge regarding the conditions the hostages were kept in and ill-treatment meted out, including some accounts of sexual violence; a 12-year-old boy was forced to watch videos of the 7 October attacks, according to his aunt. An Israeli doctor reportedly said that some of the hostages were drugged while in captivity.\nAccording to Israeli sources, 136 hostages are reportedly still being held in Gaza, including two siblings, a 10-month-old baby and a 4-year-old child; on 12 December, 19 hostages were declared dead.\nHumanitarian catastrophe\nDuring the humanitarian pause, humanitarian aid agencies were reportedly able to scale up the delivery of aid to Gaza, including to the north of Wadi Gaza, which had been largely cut off from aid deliveries.\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic, especially with the resumption of the hostilities, and humanitarian operations inside Gaza face significant challenges.\nSince 11 October at 2 pm local time, Gaza has been under electricity blackout; fuel-run backup generators are used to keep critical infrastructure functional.\nThe Erez crossing between Gaza and Israel has been closed since the start of hostilities on 7 October.\nAs of 29 December, the total number of aid convoys that have entered Gaza since 21 October is 5,902; around 500 trucks reportedly reached Gaza every working day before the hostilities. For more than five weeks, the Israeli authorities did not allow the entry of fuel; the Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Philippe Lazzarini, said previously that fuel imports must be allowed, otherwise “there will be no humanitarian response, no aid reaching people in need, no power for hospitals, no water, no bread”. On 13 November, UNRWA reported that its fuel reserves had been depleted and warned of an immediate shutdown of its humanitarian operations in Gaza. On 18 November, 123,000 litres of fuel were reportedly brought into Gaza from Egypt; the first fuel imports had been allowed to enter Gaza on 15 November.\nOn 17 December, aid entered through the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza for the first time. Delivery through Kerem Shalom was halted between 25 and 28 December, reportedly due to security concerns, and resumed on 29 December.\nOn 7 December, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, “reiterate in the clearest terms possible that wilfully impeding relief supplies to civilians may constitute a war crime” under the Rome Statute of the ICC.\nIn early December, the World Food Programme (WFP) released a food security assessment for Gaza, which documents inadequate food consumption in 97% of households in northern Gaza and 83% of households in southern Gaza, respectively. Furthermore, 48% of residents in the north and 38% in the south suffer from severe levels of hunger; they have around 1.8 and 1.5 litres of clean water per day at their disposal, respectively. 90% of Gazans in the north and two thirds in the south reportedly had to go one full day and night without food; 18% and 13%, respectively indicated that they endured this for over 10 days in the last month. The deputy director of the WFP said that half of Gaza’s population is starving.\nIn a statement dated 11 November, UNRWA Commissioner-General Lazzarini said: “Every little girl and boy I met in an UNRWA shelter asked me for bread and water”.\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, warned of “a heightened risk of atrocity crimes” in light of an “apocalyptic” humanitarian situation in Gaza.\nOn 21 December, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that “93% of the population in Gaza is facing crisis levels of hunger, with insufficient food and high levels of malnutrition”, while communicable diseases, including diarrhoeal and respiratory infections – the former a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide – as well as meningitis and chickenpox are spreading rapidly.\nAt least one out of four households are “experiencing an extreme lack of food and starvation … having resorted to selling off their possessions and other extreme measures to afford a simple meal”.\nAs of 21 December, 2.2 million Gazans were “at imminent risk of famine”, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC).\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres wrote on LinkedIn that “our out of five of the hungriest people anywhere in the world are in Gaza”.\nIn a statement dated 5 January 2024, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said that “Gaza has become a place of death and despair”, which “has simply become uninhabitable”, with its population “witnessing daily threats to their very existence – while the world watches on”. He called for “an immediate end to the war, not just for the people of Gaza and its threatened neighbors, but for the generations to come who will never forget these 90 days of hell and of assaults on the most basic precepts of humanity”.\nDisplacement and destruction of civilian infrastructure\nAn estimated 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza – almost 85% of the population – have been displaced, according to UNRWA, a majority of whom are reportedly sheltering in UNRWA facilities. On 16 November, UNRWA Commissioner-General Lazzarini said in a statement that the world “just witnessed the largest displacement of Palestinians since 1948”. Many Gazans have been displaced multiple times.\nUN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths said on 7 December that “the pace of the military assault in southern Gaza is a repeat of the assault in northern Gaza”, and that “it has made no place safe for civilians in southern Gaza”.\nOn 9 December, Save the Children warned that “wo months of relentless bombardment, an Israeli-imposed siege, and dangerous relocation orders have stripped families’ options for survival in Gaza”.\nIn an op-ed for the New York Times dated 11 December, the heads of six humanitarian aid organizations wrote that “n no other war we can think of in this century have civilians been so trapped, without any avenue or option to escape to save themselves and their children”.\nAs of 4 January, more than 65,000 housing units in Gaza have been destroyed and over 290,000 others partially damaged, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza. More than 69% of school buildings have been damaged, and 625,000 children cannot go to school. Damage has also been inflicted on universities, and academics and scholars have been killed.\nThe Israeli air force announced on 12 October that between 7 and 12 October alone, it has dropped around 6,000 bombs on Gaza; during the intervention in Libya, which lasted from March until October 2011, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) reportedly dropped an estimated 7,700 bombs.\nThe Financial Times has reported that according to military analysts, “the destruction of northern Gaza in less than seven weeks has approached that caused by the years-long carpet-bombing of German cities during the second world war”.\nIt has been suggested that Israel’s obliteration of wide swathes of residential houses and public infrastructure in Gaza may constitute “domicide”, i.e., “the massive and deliberate destruction of homes in order to cause human suffering”.\nThe total number of rockets fired into Israel between 7 October and the end of December 2023 was estimated to be around 12,000, according to Israeli sources.\nAccounts of sexual and gender-based violence\nOn 29 November, UN Secretary-General António Guterres wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that “here are numerous accounts of sexual violence during the abhorrent acts of terror by Hamas on 7 October that must be vigorously investigated and prosecuted”.\nOn 1 December, UN Women “called for all accounts of gender-based violence to be duly investigated and prosecuted, with the rights of the victim at the core”. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk also called for a full investigation.\nGrim milestones\nAccording to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 29 journalists were killed between 7 and 27 October, which marks “the deadliest period for journalists covering conflict since CPJ began tracking in 1992”; as of 11 January 2024, there have been at least 79 fatalities amongst journalists and media personnel.\nAccording to a statement by Save the Children dated 29 October, 3,195 children in Gaza have been killed since 7 October, which “is more than the number killed in armed conflict globally – across more than 20 countries – over the course of a whole year, for the last three years”; as of 11 December, the total number of children killed in Gaza stands at around 7,729 (numbers reported by the Gaza Ministry of Health and the Government Media Office in Gaza).\nSave the Children said on 7 January that on average, more than 10 Gazan children per day have lost either one or both legs.\nAccording to a statement by the UN and other humanitarian organizations dated 5 November, 88 UNRWA staff have been killed since 7 October, which constitutes “the highest number of United Nations fatalities ever recorded in a single conflict”. As of 7 January, the number of UNRWA staff killed stands at 142.\nAs of 7 January, at least 326 health workers have been killed.\nAttacks by Hamas-led armed groups from GazaOn 7 October 2023, from the early morning hours, Hamas and other armed groups from Gaza carried out an attack against Israel, firing barrages of rockets towards the southern and central part of the country. The armed groups crossed the Gaza border fence into Israeli territory by land, air, and sea, where they injured, brutalized, and killed Israeli forces and Israeli and foreign civilians, including more than 360 attendees of a music festival near Re’im and residents of kibbutzim Kfar Azza and Be’eri. Over the course of three days, there were gun battles and hostage situations in southern Israeli towns, with the Israeli army only regaining control on 9 October. Indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli cities, including Ben Gurion Airport near Lod (formerly Lydda), continued in the weeks thereafter.Overall, more than 1,200 Israeli and foreign nationals in Israel were killed, and around 5,400 more injured; more than 200 were abducted to Gaza, amongst them babies, children, and the elderly, according to Israeli sources.According to reports, first responders encountered “horrifying scenes, including the slaughter of elderly people and finding bloody rooms crowded with massacred civilians”. Footage of the 7 October attacks screened by the Israeli military reportedly depicts “grenades thrown directly at families, a man being decapitated with a shovel from his garden, he situation is fast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as a whole and for peace and security in the region”, which “must be avoided at all cost”. On 8 December, the US vetoed a Security Council resolution that would have called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; the UK abstained, while the 13 remaining members of the Council, including the three other permanent members – France, Russia, and China – voted in favour.On 12 December, the General Assembly adopted a short, non-binding resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire; the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages; humanitarian access; and compliance by all parties with international law. 153 States voted in favour of the resolution, 23 abstained, and 10 voted against (including Israel, the US, Paraguay, Czechia, and Austria). On 19 December, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk reiterated his call for a ceasefire, observing that “Palestinians are being forced into smaller and smaller areas, in a mass displacement up to the Gaza-Egyptian border while military operations continue to encroach ever closer”, with “simply nowhere left in Gaza for them to go”.On 21 December, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued a decision pursuant to its Early Warning and Urgent Action Procedure in which it called upon “Israel, the State of Palestine and other State parties to institute an immediate and sustained ceasefire in the occupied Gaza Strip”. The Committee also expressed its concern about Israel’s “heavy bombardments, indiscriminate attacks using explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas, collective punishment and obstruction of humanitarian aid”, and “attacks that target or impact civilian infrastructure leading to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis”, which “raise serious concerns regarding the obligation of Israel and other State parties to prevent crimes against humanity and genocide”. The decision further specifically urged Israel “to firmly condemn any form of hate speech and distance itself from racist hate speech expressed by politicians and public figures … and ensure that such acts are investigated and adequately and robustly punished”.On 22 December, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling upon all parties to the hostilities to comply with their obligations under international law, including with respect to securing the safe passage of humanitarian relief “at scale directly to the Palestinian civilian population throughout the Gaza Strip”. The Council further requested that the UN Secretary-General appoint a Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for purposes of “expediting the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip”, and that said Coordinator “establish a UN mechanism for accelerating the provision of humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza through states which are not party to the conflict”, amongst other points. Dutch national Sigrid Kaag was appointed to the post at the end of December.On 29 December, South Africa filed an application instituting proceedings against Israel with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the principal judicial organ of the UN. South Africa’s application is brought on the basis of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention), which was adopted in December 1948 and to which both Israel and South Africa are party. South Africa argues that Israel has been violating its obligations under the Convention by failing to prevent genocide, carrying out acts that amount to genocide, and failing to prevent or punish incitement to genocide by Israeli public officials. Furthermore, it bases its standing to invoke Israel’s responsibility before the ICJ on the grounds that the Genocide Convention gives rise to obligations erga omnes partes, i.e., obligations that are owed to all parties to the Convention, regardless of whether they are directly injured by the conduct complained of. An Israeli official referred to the case as an “absurd blood libel” that Israel would contest before the Court.Outside view of the peace palace in the Hague (Netherlands), in February 2012. © CIJ-ICJ/UN-ONU, Frank van Beek - Courtesy of the ICJ.

Israel has issued warnings that shelters are not safe in northern Gaza, urging civilians to evacuate to the south,4The New Arab, ‘Israel says north Gaza shelters ‘not safe’ in new evacuation warning,’ 28 October 2023 but 600,000 people are believed to remain in the north.5David Gritten, ‘Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north,’ BBC, 30 October 2023 IDF missiles struck a Greek Orthodox Church in Gaza City, killing at least 16 Palestinians, on 19 October. Israel has been also increasingly pressuring hospitals in northern Gaza – including al-Quds hospital sheltering hundreds of patients and over 14,000 displaced people – to evacuate, conducting airstrikes in the vicinity of the health facilities.6Al Jazeera, ‘Palestinians fear Israel will strike Gaza’s al-Quds Hospital,’ 31 October 2023 Despite the evacuation orders, Israeli forces have also continued to target areas in the south.\nFollowing a night of heavy bombardment as well as a communications and internet outage, Israeli ground forces entered the Gaza Strip on 27 October, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu officially announcing the start of the “second stage” of the war a day later. While the IDF has remained vague about the location and number of Israeli troops already deployed, its forces are believed to be pushing forward slowly and cautiously in three entry zones7Washington Post, ‘Early stages of Israeli ground assault in Gaza shrouded in secrecy,’ 29 October 2023 (see map below). Tanks and armored vehicles have entered the semi-rural area to the north of Gaza City, while IDF forces have clashed with Hamas militants adjacent to the Erez crossing at entrances of the group’s underground network.8Reuters, ‘What we know about Israel’s invasion of Gaza so far,’ 30 October 2023 By 30 October there were reports that Israeli tanks had reached Gaza’s main north-south road in an effort to cut Gaza City off from the south.9Reuters, ‘Israeli forces attack Gaza’s main city from two directions,’ 30 October 2023 On 31 October, clashes were reported in the al-Tawam area, northwest of Gaza City.10Ahram Online, ‘LIVE UPDATES: Dozens killed, hundreds injured in Israeli strike on Jabalia refugee camp – Day 25,’ 31 October 2023\nThe movements of Israeli forces north and south of Gaza City suggest that it is the focus of the ground operation.11Associated Press, ‘Israel pushes deeper into Gaza and frees Hamas captive; Netanyahu rejects calls for cease-fire,’ 31 October 2023 But before reaching Hamas strongholds in Gaza City12Financial Times, ‘Military briefing: ‘Everything you can imagine and worse’ awaits Israeli army in Gaza,’ 12 October 2023 – where much of the group’s forces and infrastructure are believed to be located13Associated Press, ‘Israel pushes deeper into Gaza and frees Hamas captive; Netanyahu rejects calls for cease-fire,’ 31 October 2023 – Israeli soldiers will have to breach defensive lines of mines, booby traps, snipers, and mortar attacks. Once entering Gaza City, the urban warfare stage of the offensive is expected to be protracted and challenging for Israel. IDF forces will have to fight Hamas militants in an extensive labyrinth of tunnels that the group has built under the densely populated strip,14Time, ‘Israel’s Vow to ‘Eliminate Hamas’ Is Unrealistic. Here’s What Netanyahu Must Acknowledge,’ 28 October 2023 with the presence of Israeli captives likely held in these tunnels further complicating the operation.15Associates Press, ‘ A ‘spider web’ of Hamas tunnels in Gaza Strip raises risks amid Israeli ground offensive,’ 28 October 2023\nViolence Escalates to Levels Not Seen Since the Second Intifada in the West Bank Amid Military Raids, Settler Attacks, and Violent Demonstrations\nWhile international attention has focused on the Gaza Strip, violence has reached levels in the West Bank that have not been seen since the Second Intifada. ACLED records over 115 fatalities in the area over the past month, marking the highest number of fatalities in a single month in the West Bank in almost two decades.16United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, ‘Data on casualties,’ 2023 Over 1,000 political violence incidents were reported in the West Bank between 7 and 27 October, nearly three times more than the preceding month of September. Clashes between the IDF and armed groups in the West Bank, as well as unarmed demonstrators and rioters, have significantly intensified. Additionally, settlers have escalated attacks against Palestinians and their properties.\nEven before the outbreak of the current war in Gaza, tensions were running high in the West Bank for over a year amid a significant rise in clashes between armed groups and IDF forces. Since the Hamas attack in early October, over 175 armed clashes have been reported across the West Bank. Palestinian militants have fired shots at Israeli military checkpoints and positions, while also engaging with IDF forces during their arrest raids. In the deadliest event in the West Bank since 7 October, Hamas and Katibat Tulkarm – Quick Response militants clashed with the Israeli military during an operation in the Nur al-Shams refugee camp in Tulkarm on 19 October, resulting in at least 15 fatalities, including six children, an Israeli soldier, and an unknown number of militants. On 25 October, IDF forces clashed with Katibat Jenin militants in the Jenin refugee camp, while a rare airstrike was carried out that killed four Palestinians. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have also reportedly killed approximately 80 unarmed Palestinians across nearly 600 violent demonstrations and riots that have been reported since 7 October, a record high in the ACLED dataset for the West Bank.\nSettler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank – which has been steadily increasing in recent years – also reached an all-time monthly high in October. Notably, ACLED records over 60 incidents of violence against civilians carried out by armed settlers since 7 October. This is an increase of over 20 times compared to September and more than double the number of armed events involving settlers during the previous tensions in May 2021, when an outbreak of violence at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem triggered unrest across Palestine and Israel. At least six Palestinian civilians have been killed by settlers since 7 October. In addition to armed attacks, rioting settlers have engaged in nearly 200 mob violence events, raiding villages, throwing rocks, setting fire to homes, cars, shops, and farms, and physically assaulting Palestinians. Hundreds of Palestinians are believed to have been forced to relocate elsewhere in the West Bank due to settler violence in recent weeks.17Voice of America, ‘Biden: Israeli Settler Attacks on Palestinians Must Stop,’ 25 October 2023 Emboldened by the support of far-right figures in the the Israeli government,18Alex Lederman, ‘Settler Violence in the West Bank Undermines Israel’s Security, Time, 27 October 2023 settlers are likely seizing the opportunity amid the ongoing war in Gaza to push forward their efforts to take control of additional territory in the West Bank.19Susannah George and Sufian Taha, ‘As settler violence surges, West Bank Palestinians fear new displacement,’ Washington Post, 30 October 2023\nعربي\nبعد ليلة من القصف العنيف، إضافة لانقطاع الاتصالات والإنترنت، دخلت القوات البرية الإسرائيلية قطاع غزة في 27 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، حيث أعلن رئيس الوزراء بنيامين نتنياهو رسمياً بدء “المرحلة الثانية” من الحرب في اليوم التالي. وبينما ظل جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي غامضاً بشأن موقع القوات الإسرائيلية المنتشرة بالفعل وعددها، يُعتقد أن قواته تتقدم ببطء وحذر في ثلاث مناطق دخول\nحتى قبل اندلاع الحرب الحالية في غزة، كانت التوترات تتصاعد في الضفة الغربية لأكثر من عام وسط تصاعد كبير في الاشتباكات بين الجماعات المسلحة وقوات جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي. ومنذ هجوم حماس في أوائل شهر أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، أفادت التقارير بوقوع أكثر من 175 اشتباكاً مسلحاً في جميع أنحاء الضفة الغربية. وأطلق مسلحون فلسطينيون النار على نقاط تفتيش ومواقع عسكرية إسرائيلية، بينما اشتبكوا أيضاً مع قوات جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي أثناء مداهمات اعتقالهم. وفي الحدث الأكثر دموية في الضفة الغربية منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، اشتبكت حماس وكتيبة طولكرم (مجموعة الرد السريع) مع الجيش الإسرائيلي خلال عملية في مخيم نور الشمس للاجئين في طولكرم في 19 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، ما أسفر عن وفيات لا تقل عن 15 شخصاً، من بينهم 6 أطفال وجندي إسرائيلي وعدد غير معروف من المقاتلين. وفي 25 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، اشتبكت قوات جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي مع مقاتلي كتيبة جنين في مخيم جنين للاجئين، بينما نُفذّت غارة جوية نادرة أسفرت عن مقتل أربعة فلسطينيين. وفي الوقت ذاته، أفادت التقارير أيضاً أن القوات الإسرائيلية قتلت حوالي 80 فلسطينياً أعزل في ما يقارب 600 مظاهرة عنيفة وأعمال شغب وردت عنها تقارير منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، ويعدّ رقم قياسي في مجموعة بيانات ACLED للضفة الغربية.\nوصل عنف المستوطنين ضد الفلسطينيين في الضفة الغربية، والذي تزايد باستمرار في السنوات الأخيرة، إلى أعلى مستوى شهري له على الإطلاق في شهر أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. ومن الجدير بالذكر أن ACLED سجلت أكثر من 60 حادثة عنف ضد المدنيين، نفذها مستوطنون مسلحون منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. ويمثل ذلك زيادة بأكثر من 20 مرةً مقارنةً بشهر سبتمبر/أيلول، وأكثر من ضعف عدد أحداث العنف المسلح التي شارك فيها المستوطنون خلال التوترات السابقة في شهر مايو/أيار 2021، عندما أدى اندلاع لأعمال العنف في المسجد الأقصى في القدس إلى اضطرابات في جميع أنحاء فلسطين وإسرائيل. كما قتل المستوطنون 8 مدنيين فلسطينيين على الأقل منذ 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. إضافة إلى الهجمات المسلحة، شارك المستوطنون المثيرون للشغب في ما يقارب 200 من أحداث عنف العصابات التي تمثلت في مداهمة القرى، ورشق الحجارة، وإشعال النيران في المنازل والسيارات والمتاجر والمزارع، والاعتداء الجسدي على الفلسطينيين. ويُعتقد أن مئات الفلسطينيين قد أُجبروا على الانتقال إلى أماكن أخرى في الضفة الغربية بسبب عنف المستوطنين في الأسابيع الأخيرة.\nNew York Times, ‘Under Shroud of Secrecy, Israel Invasion of Gaza Has Begun,’ 30 October 2023\nUnited Nations, ‘Security Council: Middle East,’ 30 October 2023\nFinancial Times, ‘Military briefing: how Israel is deploying its devastating bombing campaign in Gaza,’ 29 October 2023\nThe New Arab, ‘Israel says north Gaza shelters ‘not safe’ in new evacuation warning,’ 28 October 2023\nDavid Gritten, ‘Tank seen on key Gaza road as Israeli forces push deeper into north,’ BBC, 30 October 2023\nAl Jazeera, ‘Palestinians fear Israel will strike Gaza’s al-Quds Hospital,’ 31 October 2023\nWashington Post, ‘Early stages of Israeli ground assault in Gaza shrouded in secrecy,’ 29 October 2023\nReuters, ‘What we know about Israel’s invasion of Gaza so far,’ 30 October 2023\nReuters, ‘Israeli forces attack Gaza’s main city from two directions,’ 30 October 2023\nAhram Online, ‘LIVE UPDATES: Dozens killed, hundreds injured in Israeli strike on Jabalia refugee camp – Day 25,’ 31 October 2023\nAssociated Press, ‘Israel pushes deeper into Gaza and frees Hamas captive; Netanyahu rejects calls for cease-fire,’ 31 October 2023\nFinancial Times, ‘Military briefing: ‘Everything you can imagine and worse’ awaits Israeli army in Gaza,’ 12 October 2023\nAssociated Press, ‘Israel pushes deeper into Gaza and frees Hamas captive; Netanyahu rejects calls for cease-fire,’ 31 October 2023\nTime, ‘Israel’s Vow to ‘Eliminate Hamas’ Is Unrealistic.

Details are subject to change as further information becomes available.\nDuring the second week of the conflict, Israel repeated orders for the forced evacuation of northern Gaza — including 22 hospitals — despite World Health Organization (WHO) warnings about its impact on thousands of patients.23WHO, ‘Evacuation orders by Israel to hospitals in northern Gaza are a death sentence for the sick and injured,’ 14 October 2023 Over 600,000 Palestinians are believed to have already fled northern Gaza amid heavy airstrikes and the looming threat of a ground invasion.24Chao Deng and Menna Farouk, ‘Families in Gaza Fear for Their Lives Even After Fleeing to the South,’ The Wall Street Journal, 17 October 2023\nIsraeli airstrikes have also hit central and southern Gaza. Dozens of airstrikes targeted the southern governorates of Rafah and Khan Yunis and the central governorate of Dayr al-Balah during the second week of the conflict, resulting in hundreds of fatalities. On 17 October alone, these strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians in Khan Yunis — most of whom evacuated from northern Gaza25David Gritten, ‘Dozens killed as Israeli strikes hit southern Gaza refuge areas,’ BBC News, 17 October 2023 —while at least 49 people died in airstrikes at the Rafah border crossing. Strikes have hit other shelters and refugee areas, including a United Nations-run school in al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza on 17 October. Israel has claimed that its airstrikes in central and southern Gaza are aimed at Hamas forces hiding in the area.26Sky News, ‘Israel-Hamas war: IDF accuses Hamas of hiding in southern Gaza,’ 17 October 2023 The regional head of Hamas’ intelligence was reportedly killed in the southern town of Khan Yunis on 16 October, while the military commander of Hamas’ central brigade was killed in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on the same day.\nAmid a UN warning that no area in the Gaza Strip is safe for Palestinians to hide from airstrikes,27UNRWA, ‘Gaza: UNRWA school sheltering displaced families is hit, 17 October 2023 thousands of Palestinians have remained in northern Gaza, taking shelter in schools and hospitals.28Voice of America, ‘Gaza’s Crowded Hospitals Near Breaking Point,’ 16 October 2023In the deadliest incident in Gaza since the start of the current conflict, a blast at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City killed over 470 Palestinians and injured hundreds more.29Al Jazeera, ‘Where in Gaza is al-Ahli Arab Hospital, the site hit amid war with Israel?,18 October 2023 Israel has blamed the strike on misfired PIJ rockets, while Hamas has claimed that the hospital was hit by Israeli airstrikes. Hamas and PIJ rockets have fallen short in the past, with the IDF suggesting that at least 450 rockets have landed inside Gaza in this most recent round of hostilities.30France 24, ‘What we know about the deadly blast at Gaza City’s al-Ahli hospital,’ 18 October 2023 While some experts have noted that the lack of a visible deep crater at the hospital may support Israel’s claims, others have suggested that the scale of the explosion and the extent of destruction is beyond Hamas and PIJ capabilities.31The Guardian, ‘‘They believed it was safe’: death toll rising after blast at Gaza hospital,’ 18 October 2023\nFollowing the blast at the hospital, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas backed out of a scheduled summit with Jordanian King Abdullah II, American President Joe Biden, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, prompting King Abdullah to cancel the summit. In announcing the decision, King Abdullah accused Israel of engaging in collective punishment.32Al Jazeera, ‘Jordan cancels Biden summit after hundreds killed in Gaza hospital blast,’ 17 October 2023 The blast also prompted protests and violent demonstrations across the region. In Jordan, dozens of protesters attempted to storm the Israeli embassy in Amman. In Lebanon, following Hezbollah’s call for a day of rage, hundreds of people clashed with security forces outside the American embassy in Beirut.33The Guardian, ‘More protests expected across Middle East after Gaza hospital blast,’ 18 October 2023 In Turkey, police used pepper spray to disperse protesters who attempted to enter the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. Meanwhile, protesters clashed with Palestinian police in Ramallah, Nablus, Tubas, and Jenin in the West Bank, chanting slogans against the PA leadership and in support of Hamas.34Al Jazeera, ‘Protesters clash with Palestinian police in West Bank,’ 17 October 2023\nThe volatile situation in Gaza is increasingly raising concerns about the region being pushed to the brink of a wider conflict with unpredictable consequences.\nTensions Flare Along the Israel-Lebanon Border\nAlong Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, violence has steadily escalated in the past few days. Following tit-for-tat exchanges of rockets and shelling in the first week of conflict, Lebanese Hezbollah and the IDF have increased their daily exchange of cross-border attacks, with the escalation of violence marking the most serious flare-up at the border since the 2006 Lebanon War. As of 18 October, ACLED records the killing of 13 Hezbollah fighters, three Hamas and two PIJ militants, five Israeli soldiers, as well as at least three Lebanese civilians (including a journalist) and one Israeli civilian in cross-border skirmishes since 7 October.\nNote: Map based on preliminary data. Details are subject to change as further information becomes available.\nOn 15 October, Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at several Israeli locations along the border, resulting in the first Israeli civilian fatality in the northern front, along with an Israeli soldier. The day after, Israel evacuated residents from 28 villages within two kilometers of the Lebanese border as it continued to reinforce its troops in the border area.35BBC, ‘Israel evacuates communities near Lebanon border amid fears of escalation,’ 16 October 2023\nOn 17 October, tensions further intensified as the IDF killed four militants who attempted to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon. Without claiming responsibility for the infiltration attempt, Hezbollah announced that five of its fighters were killed during hostilities on Tuesday – the largest number of fatalities the group has suffered in a single day during the current crisis. On the same day, Hezbollah fired several anti-tank missiles at the town of Metula and Yiftah Kibbutz, as well as two gatherings of troops on the border, injuring two soldiers and one civilian. Cross-border hostilities continued on 18 October, with three Hezbollah fighters killed and four Israeli soldiers injured.\nLebanese Hezbollah is believed to be a more formidable force and a greater potential danger to Israel than Palestinian militants, possessing air-defense capabilities36Middle East Monitor, ‘Israel concern over Hezbollah’s doubling of air defence systems – Israel media,’ 30 June 2023 and having amassed an arsenal of long-range rockets and precision-guided missiles since 2006.37Ben Hubbard and Aaron Boxerman, ‘For Hezbollah and Israel, the Stakes in Any Broader War Are High,’ New York Times, 17 October 2023 The scope of the recent round of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah has remained thus far limited, and the fighting has not spread beyond a radius of roughly four kilometers on either side of the border. However, depending on developments in Gaza, Hezbollah may become increasingly inclined to escalate the situation on the northern front to relieve pressure on Hamas and Gazan civilians. Furthermore, a miscalculation or mismanagement of the currently limited hostilities by either side has the potential to lead to inadvertent escalation. Given the severe regional implications that the widening of the conflict may have if a full-scale war were to break out between Israel and the Iranian-allied Hezbollah, the United States has been sending a message of deterrence by moving additional warships and aircraft to the region over the past two weeks.38Associated Press, ‘The US is moving quickly to boost Israel’s military. A look at what assistance it’s providing,’ 15 October 2023\nEnglishعربيEnglish\nUpdate: 13 October\nAlmost one week since Hamas launched a multipronged assault on southern Israel on 7 October, fighting has subsided inside Israel, while Israeli airstrikes have hit Gaza on an “unprecedented scale.”39The Times of Israel, ‘IAF hits Gaza on ‘unprecedented scale’; Strip’s power plant shuts down,’ 11 October 2023 Tensions have risen along Israel’s northern border amid the escalating conflict, as violence continues at heightened levels in the West Bank.\nHamas Rocket Strikes into Southern Israel Continue as the IDF Reasserts TerritorialControl\nViolence inside Israel has abated since the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced it had regained control of all territories along the border with Gaza on 10 October, mining the area to prevent any renewed incursion,40The Times of Israel, ‘IDF says Gaza border finally sealed, bodies of 1,500 terrorists found inside Israel,’ 10 October 2023 more than 72 hours after the Hamas surprise attack. Despite the announcement, a small number of Hamas militants have remained inside Israeli territory, with sporadic clashes reported until 13 October.41Jerusalem Post, ‘Multiple impacts reported in Ashkelon, Sderot, no injuries reported, 13 October 2023 The official Israeli death toll for the initial day of the Hamas assault has continued to rise, surpassing 1,300. The majority have been civilians, with the IDF putting the number of military fatalities at 264.42Emanuel Fabian, IDF releases names of seven more soldiers killed during Hamas onslaught,’ Times of Israel, 13 October 2023\nHamas has also continued launching hundreds of rockets into Israel. While the majority of rockets have been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome air defense system, there have been a small number of direct hits. Two foreign workers were killed in Eshkol regional council on 10 October in a rocket attack, while about a dozen people were injured in Ashdod on 11 October. A further five Israelis were reported injured, two severely, in another rocket attack on 12 October in Sderot. At least one moderate and three light injuries were also reported on 13 October in Rehovot.43Jerusalem Post, ‘Israelis wounded in Rehovot as Hamas restarts fire on Tel Aviv area,’ 13 October 2023\nAs of 13 October, Israel is still preparing for a potential ground invasion of Gaza, with a massive military buildup continuing along the border. But with Hamas holding an estimated 200 Israeli soldiers and civilians captured inside Gaza,44The Times of Israel, ‘Israel girds for long war as death toll since Hamas terror onslaught passes 1,300,’ 12 October 2023 the potential Israeli operation faces severe challenges. The Israeli military suggested on Thursday morning that no political decision regarding the launch of the ground operation had yet been made.45BBC, ‘Gaza situation dire, UN says, as Israeli military admits security failures,’ 12 October 2023 Israel, however, issued a warning to Palestinians in northern Gaza on 13 October to relocate to southern Gaza within the next 24 hours, suggesting that a ground operation may be imminent.46Associated Press, Israel orders the evacuation of 1.1 million people from northern part of Gaza, the UN says, 13 October 2023\nAt the same time, Israeli settlers have escalated attacks against Palestinians,61Amira Hass, ‘Israeli Settlers Aren’t Pausing the Expulsion and Dispossession in the West Bank,’ Haaretz, 12 October 2023 killing four on 11 October and a

there are serious concerns of a further deterioration of security in the West Bank, as well as inside Israel.64The Cradle, ‘Israel arms Jewish citizens in ‘mixed cities,’ 10 October 2023\nعربي\nتحديث صحيفة وقائع إسرائيل وفلسطين: 13 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول\nتراجع القتال داخل إسرائيل، بعد مرور أسبوع تقريباً على شن حماس هجوماً متعدد الجوانب على جنوب إسرائيل في 7 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، بينما ضربت الغارات الجوية الإسرائيلية غزة على ”نطاق غير مسبوق.“ وتصاعدت التوترات على طول الحدود الشمالية لإسرائيل وسط الصراع المتصاعد، مع استمرار العنف بمستويات مرتفعة في الضفة الغربية.\nتواصل الهجمات الصاروخية لحماس على جنوب إسرائيل بينما يستعيد جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي السيطرة على الأراضي الحدودية\nالسيطرة\nتراجعت حدة العنف داخل إسرائيل منذ أن أعلن جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي أنه استعاد السيطرة على جميع الأراضي على طول الحدود مع غزة في 10 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، حيث زرع الألغام في المنطقة لمنع أي توغل جديد،\nواصلت حماس أيضاً إطلاق مئات الصواريخ على إسرائيل. وبينما اعترض نظام الدفاع الجوي الإسرائيلي الذي يُطلق عليه اسم ”القبة الحديدية“ غالبية الصواريخ، فقد كان هناك عدد قليل من الإصابات المباشرة. حيث قُتل عاملان أجنبيان في مجلس إشكول الإقليمي في 10 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول في هجوم صاروخي، بينما أصيب حوالي عشرة أشخاص في أشدود في 11 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. وأُبلغ عن إصابة خمسة إسرائيليين آخرين، اثنان منهم في حالة خطيرة، في هجوم صاروخي آخر وقع في 12 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول في سديروت. كما أُبلغ عن إصابة واحدة متوسطة على الأقل وثلاث إصابات طفيفة في 13 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول في رحوفوت.\nلا تزال إسرائيل، حتى 13 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، تستعد لغزو بري محتمل لغزة، مع استمرار الحشد العسكري الضخم على طول الحدود. ولكن مع احتجاز حماس لما يقدّر بنحو 200 جندي ومدني إسرائيلي داخل غزة،\nحملة غارات جوية إسرائيلية غير مسبوقة تستهدف غزة\nكثفت إسرائيل غاراتها الجوية على غزة، منذ صد الهجوم البري الذي شنته حماس، ما أسفر عن مقتل ما يقرب من 1800 شخصاً حتى بعد ظهر يوم الجمعة.\nفرضت إسرائيل الآن أيضاً حصاراً كاملاً على غزة، مع إعلان وزير الدفاع الإسرائيلي يوآف غالانت عن أن الجيب الساحلي لن يحصل على ”كهرباء، ولا طعام، ولا ماء، ولا وقود.“ حيث تأتي غالبية الكهرباء في غزة من خطوط الكهرباء الإسرائيلية، وقد نفد الوقود من محطتها الوحيدة لتوليد الكهرباء يوم الأربعاء، مما يعني أن غزة ستصبح دون كهرباء قريباً.\nنزح أكثر من 420,000 فلسطيني داخلياً. ويواجه المدنيون في غزة أزمة إنسانية في أعقاب الحصار الذي دام 16 عاماً والذي أدى إلى تقييد حركة البضائع والأشخاص تقييداً شديداً.\nاندلاع أعمال العنف على طول الحدود الشمالية لإسرائيل\nفي الوقت نفسه، وصلت التوترات الإقليمية المتزايدة إلى أعمال عنف مسلح على جانبي الحدود الشمالية لإسرائيل مع لبنان وسوريا (انظر الخريطة أدناه). وفي 10 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، أطلقت جهات غير معروفة قذائف هاون من الجانب السوري من مرتفعات الجولان على إسرائيل، دون إلحاق أضرار. واستهدف جيش الدفاع الإسرائيلي مصدر القصف السوري بنيران المدفعية وقذائف الهاون. كما قصفت القوات الإسرائيلية في وقت واحد مطاري العاصمة السورية دمشق ومدينة حلب الشمالية في 12 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، ما أدى إلى خروج المطارين عن الخدمة. وفي حين أن القوات الإسرائيلية قد هاجمت أهدافاً مرتبطة بإيران في سوريا لسنوات، بما في ذلك المطارات لتعطيل الإمدادات الإيرانية، فإن الهجمات بهذا الحجم – التي تُخرج المطارات عن الخدمة – نادرة. وجاء قصف المطارين قبل زيارة مقررة لوزير الخارجية الإيراني حسين أمير عبد اللهيان إلى دمشق. ونفت إيران، الحليف المقرب للرئيس السوري بشار الأسد وحزب الله اللبناني، بشدة أي دور لها في هجوم حماس على إسرائيل،\nأطلق حزب الله صاروخاً موجهاً على مركبة عسكرية إسرائيلية في 10 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول في أعقاب التوتر الذي وقع يوم الإثنين عندما أدى القصف الإسرائيلي إلى مقتل ثلاثة من مقاتلي حزب الله، وذلك بعد محاولة تسلل عبر الحدود من جانب مقاتلي حركة الجهاد الإسلامي في فلسطين.\nليس هناك ما يشير في الوقت الحالي إلى أن حزب الله يخطط لهجوم كبير على إسرائيل، ومن المرجح أن يهدف نشاطه المحدود إلى إبقاء القوات الإسرائيلية مشغولة دون التسبب في امتداد كامل للقتال إلى لبنان. وبالمثل، لا يبدو أن إسرائيل ترغب في فتح جبهة ثانية بينما تتعامل مع حماس وحلفائها في غزة. ومع ذلك، فإن الصراع المتصاعد والتطورات على الأرض في غزة ما زالت ممكنة التحول إلى حرب إقليمية أوسع.\nتصاعد العنف في الضفة الغربية\nاستمرت التوترات في الضفة الغربية أيضاً في التصاعد. فخلال الفترة من 7 إلى 12 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، سجلت ACLED عشرات الاشتباكات بين الجيش الإسرائيلي والجماعات المسلحة الفلسطينية، بما في ذلك الجماعات التابعة لحركة الجهاد الإسلامي في فلسطين، وكتائب شهداء الأقصى، وحماس، ما أدى إلى ما لا يقل عن 12 حالة وفاة أبلغ عنها. وفي 12 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، أصاب مسلح فلسطيني مجهول اثنين من ضباط الشرطة الإسرائيلية أمام مركز الشرطة في القدس الشرقية، ثم قُتل بعد ذلك بالرصاص. وعلاوة على ذلك، أدت الاشتباكات بين قوات الأمن الإسرائيلية ومثيري الشغب العزل إلى مقتل ما لا يقل عن 20 فلسطينياً حتى 12 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول. ومع خروج الآلاف إلى الشوارع في مسيرة تضامنية مع الفلسطينيين في غزة في 13 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، قُتل ما لا يقل عن 11 متظاهراً في اشتباكات مع قوات الأمن الإسرائيلية في جميع أنحاء الضفة الغربية. لا تزال احتمالات اضطرار إسرائيل إلى خوض حملة متعددة الجبهات في الضفة الغربية وغزة مرتفعة.\nفي الوقت نفسه، صعّد المستوطنون الإسرائيليون هجماتهم ضد الفلسطينيين،\nتايمز أوف إسرائيل، ”سلاح الجو الإسرائيلي يضرب غزة على ”نطاق غير مسبوق“ وتوقف محطة
