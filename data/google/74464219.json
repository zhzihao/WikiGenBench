S. I wouldn't say I liked the ending, though. It was so cruel!helpful•20SoumikBanerjee1996Jul 25, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ18How long is The Civil Dead?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateFebruary 17, 2023 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteDirector's websiteLanguageEnglishAlso known asМилейшие мертвецыSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross US & Canada$32,346Opening weekend US & Canada$15,350Feb 12, 2023Gross worldwide$32,346See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 44 minutesColorColorAspect ratio2.39:1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was The Civil Dead (2022) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
