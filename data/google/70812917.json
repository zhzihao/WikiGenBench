While investigating, more missing cases came into light. The police officer who is in charge however, looses his hearing power in a fighting. Will he able to find the person behind?I loved the movie, however, one thing that irritates me the whole time is, the hearing problem thing. If it wasn't included, it would be more enjoyable. The story itself is pretty good so there wasn't any necessity of introducing hearing problem concept.helpful•71Misss25Aug 26, 2022Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ16How long is John Luther?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateMay 27, 2022 (India)Country of originIndiaLanguagesMalayalamTeluguProduction companyAlonsa FilmsSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross worldwide$119,892See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 15 minutesColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was John Luther (2022) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

Some with even the darkest and gruesome of subject matter. Unfortunately that particular film isn't really revered in big box office form these days, but this reminds me of the time they were. Of course the cast helps with the likes of the ultra talented duo of Andy Serkis and Idris Elba who's cat and mouse chase is pure entertainment. The story while it may remind me personally of 90s throwback thrillers is still updated for a time where cyber crime is a real threat and adds a great aspect. The action is also on full throttle in this as well which is nice to see. Overall the intensity of this film belongs in a theater but even so I do think it's a cut above for Netflix original movies these days. Very surprising film.helpful•155120tresm87Mar 10, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ14How long is Luther: The Fallen Sun?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateMarch 10, 2023 (Hong Kong)Countries of originUnited KingdomUnited StatesOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguagesEnglishEstonianPortugueseAlso known asLuther: Mặt Trời LặnFilming locationsIcelandProduction companiesBBC FilmBBC StudiosChernin EntertainmentSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 9 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby AtmosAspect ratio2.35 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
