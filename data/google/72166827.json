Jason Eisener blends his love for pro-wrestling and grindhouse horror into an extended version of the V/H/S 2 segment that doesn't quite hit the mark. While the man's passion for these pop-culture phenomenons is largely evident, I think the plot and characterizations are super thin (especially that of Samantha and Billy) and the practical effects are a tad too silly, often bordering on the comical. Maybe, that was the intention after all? Like, an anti-Spielbergian approach to showcasing a Gen Z & Gen Alpha ensemble, i.e. Foul-mouthed kids versus horny, anarchist teenagers.However, the film lacks conviction in delivering the goods. I'll give you an instance as to why. When the film is showing the \"home movies\" that the kid characters are making, it's alright to use shaky cam and extreme close-up shots as that would befit the setup. But then, why shoot straightforward action set-pieces too in shaky cam? Some of it is borderline nauseating. The main antagonist (no, not the aliens) is out-of-this-world despicable - no effort has gone into the writing or the performance. I like Eisener's work on Dark Side of the Ring, but as a feature filmmaker, I'm yet to see something truly remarkable coming from him.helpful•00arungeorge13Dec 19, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ16How long is Kids vs. Aliens?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJanuary 20, 2023 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial siteAmazonLanguageEnglishAlso known asДетки против пришельцевFilming locationsDartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada(main location)Production companiesYer DeadShut up & Colour PicturesBloody DisgustingSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 15 minutesColorColorAspect ratio1.78 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the French language plot outline for Kids vs. Aliens (2022)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to explorePhotosTop Stars to Watch in 2024See the galleryListThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2024See the listListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

This fun and feisty movie is best recommended more for younger viewers newer to the genre, but who still want to see some really gross shenanigans.Director Jason Eisener has proven in the past that he knows how to please his gorehound fans. Obviously cheap, decidedly silly, yet still also thoughtfully executed and ambitious for its budget, KvA hits above its weight class… sometimes. Yeah, the script is choppy and erratic. But we didn’t choose to watch KvA for the story development, did we? Rather we chose this movie hoping for something zany. And zany it most certainly is.Our cast of protagonist preteens are aspiring filmmakers working on their own Sci-Action-Schlock flick riding Power Wheels, wearing dinosaur masks and foam-spiked football pads, wrestling (in-costume and in a barn wrestling ring!) and firing Nerf guns. Don’t knock it. When I was 12, this would have been the best day ever! Gary (Dominic Mariche), Jack (Asher Grayson) and Miles (Ben Tector) are sweet, likable kids and enjoy their schlock filming escapades with Gary’s teen sister Sam (Phoebe Rex).The neighborhood teen jerk Billy (Calem MacDonald) has a thing for Sam and talks her into having a raging Halloween party in her barn… which occurs during an alien invasion. The party rages, things get way out of hand, and kids get abducted by aliens.It takes a while for the aliens to play a significant role in the movie. They look like classic “greys” with huge hands. Abducted kids are melted with pink goopy acidic slime, dowsed in green goopy alien vomit, and transformed into a gangly clawed Baraka-Freddy Krueger monster. These effects aren’t top shelf, but they are trying their best. As long as you wanted something silly and gross, this works.The production shortcomings are most apparent in the writing, party scenes, and the aliens’ ship whose interior is like a cheap cavern set from 1960s-era Doctor Who. The movie shines brightest when the kids are having fun filmmaking, and goopy gross things are happening. Most of the action was pretty weak, but the movie definitely has spirit and tries hard for us.The big downer is that the better-quality fun, gross, goopy gore is very limited to a couple scenes—not that there aren’t numerous minor bloody gore gags to be enjoyed as well. And sure, the movie has its silly charm to make up for some of its faults. But it’s really not enough to recommend this unless the recommendation is more for younger viewers newer to the genre.As such, I may not broadly recommend this movie. But I enjoyed it for what it was and appreciated its efforts. Moreover, I’d really like to see what Eisener could do with a more workable budget!\nRead more\nHelpful\nReport\nCorpse Circus1.0 out of 5 stars\nWho was this movie made for? Not Kids or Adults. It's a mess.\nReviewed in the United States on May 24, 2023\nWho was this movie for?It's too grown up for kids, and too dumbed down and disney tv movie feeling for adults.I watched it on shudder.. hoping it would be as fun as the short version found on V/H/S or as fun as Hobo w/ a Shotgun.I expected a solid story with fun effects, well you get the effects at least, and great lighting. The music is ok overall nothing stands out about it though.So hey aliens vs kids.. sounds fun right?Instead this movie plays it too safe most of the time, making it boring as the story and dialogue play out like a Disney made for tv movie. It's a hard watch, but I hung in for possible over the top gore, and maybe a funny pay off.Instead it then ensures it is not kid friendly with lots of sex talk and one scene of a boy urinating all over a girls bedrooom.. I get it, it shows the guy is bad, but we knew this already from how ham fisted his actign was and how often the character flip flops from decent to a punk kid.The ending is just a repeat of the cut alternate end scene of Hobo w/ a Shotgun, except not as good.There are some good gore moments, but hardly enough to save this movie. The slime scene was great. The kid turning into a bootleg freddy krueger.. looking like sharp hand joe.. made no sense and was just cringey.The fella who made this (HI JASON), needs to decide if he wants to make fun campy shclock (like he is great at) or.. go full disney. but this in between approach was terrible. Will not buy the movie, and can't show it to my young kids who would have loved it had a few elements been kept out.Who was this made for?\nRead more\n3 people found this helpful\nHelpful\nReport\nThe Movie Guy2.0 out of 5 stars\nTell them Jack Jack sent them\nReviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023\nThe story centers on Samantha (Phoebe Rex) a high school senior who would rather hang out and play cosplay with her kid brother and friends instead of being with kids her own age. As they fake fight their way through the beginning, it is there only to set up later fighting. Billy (Calem MacDonald) a charming bad boy convinces Sam to have a Halloween Party at her place while her parents are out. To her dismay they completely trash the place and then the aliens show up.It was hard to separate the props from the real items. Billy had an extremely rotten character, it was not believable. The plot was written for kids, the problem being there was a frequent use of profanity throughout the entire film as the young teen boys are very potty mouth. Not for kids. Ends weird.

Aliens” comes to theaters and VOD unrated. But had the film’s producers gone through the (largely unnecessary in the streaming era) process of submitting it to the MPAA, the second feature from director Jason Eisener would join a proud tradition: That of the R-rated kids’ movie. Think of the “Child’s Play” franchise. Think of Full Moon Features. Think of anything that has the manic energy and bright patina of a movie for children, but with swearing and violence. These types of films generally appeal to overgrown kids, which is not an insult—indulging the child within can be psychologically healthy (in moderation, of course). And they must be a lot of fun for kids who act in them, too: Imagine being ten years old and having a bunch of adults telling you that not only is it okay, but that’s it’s your job to yell, “F**k space!” while setting off fireworks. That type of joy is infectious. And indeed, “Kids Vs. Aliens” is a lively—if at times headache-inducing—experience.\nAdvertisement\nThis was clearly a DIY production, and most of the film’s budget seems to have gone towards making it as colorful as possible. It’s money well spent, as the in-your-face aesthetic at least partially compensates for the thin plot and cardboard characters. (The dialogue is crude as well, but that fits the overall tone, so it’s not as big of a deal.) Clocking in at 75 minutes, “Kids Vs. Aliens” feels more like a pilot episode than it does a fully realized feature film, not least because there’s more plot implied in the last 30 seconds than actually unfolds in the first 30 minutes. That first half-hour is spent setting up the characters, namely rambunctious preteen Gary (Dominic Mariche) and his teenage sister Samantha (Phoebe Rex), who—in another grand genre-movie tradition—are left unsupervised nearly all of the time by their workaholic parents. Technically, Samantha is in charge. But she’s a big kid herself, with interests that include cool swords and pro wrestling. And she enthusiastically participates in the movies that Gary and his pals Jack (Asher Grayson Percival) and Miles (Ben Tector) are always cooking up in a barn on Gary and Samantha’s family property. That is, until brooding bad boy Billy (Calem MacDonald) comes along. “Kids Vs. Aliens” takes a childlike view of Samantha’s subsequent turn into teen angst; in this movie’s mind, growing up means smoking cigarettes, wearing lots of eye makeup, and abandoning your true friends and interests. The moral dimensions of the plot are simplistic as well: Billy is an unequivocal villain—all of the teens in this movie except for Samantha are sociopaths, actually—and the movie reflects Gary’s hurt feelings about what he sees as his sister’s betrayal. She does get a chance to redeem herself, however, when the aliens belatedly show up halfway through the movie.\nAdvertisement\nThe extraterrestrial threat has a Halloween-store aesthetic, which is fine because this movie never claims realism during its runtime. The gore, when it does ramp up, plays like Fulci in fast-forward, melting bodies into piles of orange and yellow goop like neon Alka-Seltzers. (A couple of kids also get slimed, a fun nod from this Canadian production to the iconic Canadian series “You Can’t Do That on Television.”) At this point, all the yelling and strobe lights start to make sense. Before, they felt more like a toy truck with flashing lights and sound—again, great for kids, but best in small doses for anyone old enough to drive. “Kids Vs. Aliens” is Eisener’s first full-length film since “Hobo with a Shotgun” in 2011. And the difference in tone between the two films shows how much has changed in pop culture since then. “Hobo with a Shotgun” was part of the “neo-grindhouse” movement that came along in the wake of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s “Grindhouse” in 2007, a cynical and often mean-spirited wave of films that took puerile pleasure in pushing the boundaries of sex and violence on screen. In keeping with our current “poptimistic” age, “Kids Vs. Aliens” keeps the aggressive neon splatter, but loses the cynicism—a choice that, for all the F-bombs and fake blood, makes it a surprisingly pure film.
