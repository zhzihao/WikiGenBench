The story is peopled with a colorful cast of characters from those who lie on the margins of documented history to famous heroes like Abraham Lincoln.

What's particularly interesting is that it covers different ground than expected and the author is well balanced in his presentation, which is necessary with this kind of subject. The focus is on individuals who laid the ground for \"seekers\" and a wider influence on American society as a whole. As you would expect, this is a large area so some things are omitted or glossed over and the author's inclusion of some ideas and/or people may be questionable but a reader without expectation, a philosophical axe to grind ot an occult 'team' to support will find it a good read.\nLeggi di più\n2 persone l'hanno trovato utile\nSegnala\nTraduci recensione in Italiano\nPebbles4,0 su 5 stelle\nInteresting\nRecensito nel Regno Unito il 31 marzo 2016Acquisto verificato\nGood read\nLeggi di più\nUna persona l'ha trovato utile\nSegnala\nTraduci recensione in Italiano\nKTD4,0 su 5 stelle\nEpisodes in American Esotericism\nRecensito negli Stati Uniti il 15 settembre 2009Acquisto verificato\nIt's September 15, 2009, the day that millions of Americans will plunge into the false pop esotericism of Dan Brown's \"The Lost Symbol.\" If I could wave my magic wand -- or Freemasonic compass & square -- I would have all these readers first read Mitch Horowitz's \"Occult America: The Secret History of How Mysticism Shaped Our Nation.\" Freemasonic symbols bedeck the cover of both books, but inside \"Occult America\" you'll find a cast of real mages and mystics who influence American destiny. Instead of silly tales of Freemasonic conspiracy, the book gives reliable insights into the ambitions of American Freemasons, and Masonry takes its place as one stone in a much more variegated and intriguing pyramid of American occultism. Once one has toured Mesmerism, Mormonism, Spiritualism, Theosophy, Christian Science, New Thought, hoodoo, and other indigenous spiritual movements with Horowitz, and met characters as compellingly curious as Andrew Jackson Davis, Frank B. Robinson, Black Herman, William Dudley Pelley, Baird T. Spalding and Edgar Cayce, the ersatz esotericism of Dan Brown will seem like a distraction from America's authentic \"secret history.\"While \"Occult America\" neatly narrates many familiar episodes of American occultism - Joseph Smith's homegrown religion; the birth of Blavatsky's Theosophy; FDR's Vice-President Henry Wallace's politically disastrous flirtation with occult internationalist Nicholas Roerich - it is the exploration of the more arcane corners of the nation's surprisingly vast occult landscape that makes the book valuable. \"Go Tell Pharaoh,\" a chapter on the rise of Afro-American magic, opens with the teenage Frederick Douglass finding his first steps toward freedom with the magical assistance of hoodoo worker Sandy Jenkins, who gave the young slave a piece of \"John de conker\" - a testicle-shaped magical root that Jenkins swore would protect Douglass from the brutality of his slavemasters. From this surprising anecdote Horowitz moves on to provide a rich portrait of \"black\" - Afro-American - magical culture. The complex interplay of genuine magical practice with theatrical magic can have no more intriguing exemplar than Black Herman, whose story Horowitz tells with his characteristic balance of scholarly detail and entertaining narrative voice. The calls for self-improvement by black-nationalist leader Marcus Garvey are shown to be rooted in the motivational metaphysics of New Thought; Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science creatively mixed Garveyite uplift with eccentric theories of theological history and the pageantry of esoteric ritual and symbolism to conjure a hybrid mystery faith popular in urban black neighborhoods in the 1920s.No nation has excelled like America in spiritual hucksterism, and Horowitz's history doesn't flinch from acknowledging the dross that is mixed in with the metaphysical gold. It is no mere coincidence that Mormonism's founder Joseph Smith, bestselling proto-New Age author Baird T. Spalding and the \"sleeping prophet\" Edgar Cayce all dabbled in actual treasure-hunting. American history at its basest level can surely be seen as one long, self-serving gold rush, where the metaphysical and moral had always been sacrificed on the altar of personal wealth. \"Occult America\" rescues its cast of occult characters and movements from both their uncritical hagiographers and cynical critics, providing a nuanced overview that makes the book an important contribution to American cultural history as well as to the popular literature of esotericism. Horowitz makes excellent use of a wide range of sources (thoroughly documented and discussed in an appendix, freeing the book from footnotes), and - maddeningly missing from many works of this genre -- he includes a well-composed index.\"Occult America\" is not without its blind spots. The role of psychical research in America's cultural conversation about the paranormal goes largely unexplored, as do popular literary figures like Upton Sinclair, Stewart Edward White, and John Neihardt. The \"hidden hand\" hypothesis of Spiritualism's origins in the magical manipulations of secret brotherhoods is barely mentioned in a single paragraph, despite its holding a key to a deeper and more challenging occult conspiracy than Dan Brown could ever dream up. I yearned for a more ambitious interpretation of the cultural meaning of the varied histories uncovered here. But to satisfy these personal longings of mine, the author would have to have written a different - and undoubtedly much less readable - book. \"Occult America\" will do much to both stimulate more responsible popular thought on America's occultisms, and encourage new exploration of these hidden, but vital, histories.\nLeggi di più\n31 persone l'hanno trovato utile\nSegnala\nTraduci recensione in ItalianoVedi altre recensioni\nArticoli visualizzati di recente e suggerimenti in primo piano › Visualizza o modifica la cronologia di navigazione Dopo aver visualizzato le pagine di dettaglio del prodotto, guarda qui per trovare un modo facile per tornare alle pagine che ti interessano.

Americans all, they were among the famous figures whose paths intertwined with the mystical and esoteric movement broadly known as the occult. Brought over from the Old World and spread throughout the New by some of the most obscure but gifted men and women of early U.S. history, this “hidden wisdom” transformed the spiritual life of the still-young nation and, through it, much of the Western world. Yet the story of the American occult has remained largely untold. Now a leading writer on the subject of alternative spirituality brings it out of the shadows.

So it happens that another equally compelling take on our complicated national narrative lies just beneath the surface of things; not the grand procession of presidents, generals, and wars, but something more hidden, more mysterious, but often no less revealing.”—Ken Burns“Invisible and mysterious forces have shaped and guided the destiny of individuals and nations throughout history. From Moses to Gandhi, Jesus to Muhammad, Lincoln to Obama, hidden dimensions, in both our personal and collective consciousness, were conceiving, constructing, and shaping the course of civilization. In his precise and often detailed history of mysticism in America, Mitch Horowitz, has, in a way, tracked the evolution of our consciousness over 300 years.” —Deepak Chopra”A sparkling, down-to-earth and often deeply touching account of a powerful, much misunderstood force in the formation of America’s cultural and spiritual identity.” —Jacob Needleman, author of The American Soul and The New Religions.”“Occult America is a truly remarkable achievement. Exhaustively researched, it takes the reader from the early concepts of the supernatural, personified by Mother Ann Lee, Joseph Smith, and Madame Blavatsky, through such modern-day figures as Henry A. Wallace and Norman Vincent Peale. It opens the eyes of the relatively uninitiated, in which I include myself, to the effect the occult has had, is having, and will have on the American experience.” —John S.D. Eisenhower, author of The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge and So Far From God: The U.S. War with Mexico, 1846-1848“Religious people tend to be afraid of the word occult. Horowitz examines this aspect of life and religion in penetrating ways…and revealing its not unsubstantial influence on mainline Christianity. Truth seekers have always come from the edges. Religion itself should be glad they do.” —John Shelby Spong, author of Jesus for the Non-Religious“This book is a delightfully original tour through American history, as seen through the lives of men and women devoted to all manner of mysticism. Across these pages troop spiritualists, prophets, seers, psychics, numerologists, transcendentalists, theosophists, and historical figures from Mary Todd Lincoln to Marcus Garvey to Henry Wallace. Their stories are part of the deep-seated American tradition of searching for the new—a tradition that Occult America both explains and enriches.” — Stephen Kinzer, author of Overthrow: America’s Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq and All the Shah’s Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror“Fascinating…Occult America is a serious, wide-ranging study of all the magical, mystical, and spiritual movements that have arisen and influenced American history in often-surprising ways.” —Washington Post Book World Podcast“Occult America treats esoteric ideas and movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness that is too often lost in today’s raised-voice discussions about religion and belief systems.” —Washington Post Express “One of the most readable histories of American mysticism ever written…This is historical reporting that is crafted so well, it holds the reader much like a Voodoo spell.”—Tucson Citizen“Horowitz teases out fascinating stories of the ‘dreamers and planners who flourished along the Psychic Highway’…In showing how the paths of these figures occasionally intersected with the likes of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Horowitz argues that the influence of the occult extends beyond the séance room and into the mainstream of American thought.” —Washington Post Book World“A brilliant job of tracking down how positive thinker Norman Vincent Peale borrowed his core self-help philosophy from a religious movement called New Thought.”—Washington Times“Exhaustively researched and written in a very accessible style…Occult America fills a gap in the knowledge of religion for most people.” —Huntington News, VA“Excellent.” —Library Journal“One of the best recent books on patterns of belief.” —Fortean Times“A fantastic tour guide to the fringes of reason, high weirdness, deep esoterica, secret societies, and mystery religions.” —Boing Boing“Employing extensive research while writing with an authoritative tone, Horowitz succeeds in showing how a ‘new spiritual culture’ developed in America.”—Publishers Weekly\nLooking for More Great Reads?\n21 Books You’ve Been Meaning to Read\nClose\nDownload Hi Res\nClose\nOccult America\nCategory: Philosophy | U.S. HistoryCategory: Philosophy | Spiritual Nonfiction | ReligionCategory: Philosophy | U.S. History | Audiobooks\nOccult America\nBuy Now\nPaperback\nOct 05, 2010 | ISBN 9780553385151\nBuy\nEbook\nSep 08, 2009 | ISBN 9780553906981\nBuy\nAudiobook Download\nOct 31, 2023 | ISBN 9780593866832 | 680 Minutes\nBuy\nSee All Formats\n(2)\n+\nClose\nGet the latest updates about Mitch Horowitz\nEmail Address\nDismiss\nBack to Top\nGET PERSONALIZED BOOK RECS 📚\nConnect\nSign up for news about books, authors, and more from Penguin Random House\nStay in touch\nglobal.penguinrandomhouse.com\n© 2024 Penguin Random House\nAbout UsOur StoryOur PeopleOur ContributorsLocationsManagementSocial ImpactAccessibility StatementCareersImprints\nQuick LinksPartnershipsMedia QueriesInfluencersCompany ReadsPenguinRandomHouse.bizEmail PreferencesTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCA Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InfoAffiliate Program DisclosureFraud Alert\nHelpPublishing ProcessFAQShopping & Shipping FAQFor EducatorsSubrightsPermissions\nConnect\nSign up for news about books, authors, and more from Penguin Random House\nStay in touch\nglobal.penguinrandomhouse.com\n© 2024 Penguin Random House\nVisit other sites in the Penguin Random House Network\nBrightly\nRaise kids who love to read\nTASTE\nAn online magazine for today’s home cook\nStay in Touch\nEmail\nSign up\n×\nBecome a Member\nJust for joining you’ll get personalized recommendations on your dashboard daily and features only for members.\nFind Out More\nJoin Now\nSign In\nHi,\nMember Since\nsign out\nAccount Overview\nRecommendations\nOrders\nAccount Details\nEmail Preferences\nBookshelf\nSuccess!\nYour account has been created.

The region had once been a sanctuary of political independence and esoteric spirituality. It was now a charred land of devastation, crushed by the papal Habsburg Empire during the Thirty Years' War. The twenty-one-year-old Kelpius, a protege of mystical scholars who survived in the Rhine corridor, led his German pilgrims to the New World. Fewer than forty in number, they first traveled over land and later endured a five-month sea voyage, which proved less dangerous for the weather than for warring French and British ships crisscrossing Atlantic routes. By late June of 1694, the group reached Philadelphia, then a cluster of about five hundred houses. They settled along the wooded banks of the Wissahickon Creek outside town. There they lived a monastic existence, occupying caves and constructing a forty-foot-square log tabernacle topped with a telescope, from which they scanned the stars for holy signs. By sunlight and hearth fire, they studied astrology, alchemy, number symbolism, esoteric Christianity, Kabala, and other philosophies that had once flowered back home. Newcomers journeyed to America to join their Tabernacle in the Forest, and in the years following Kelpius's death from tuberculosis in 1708, they created a larger commune at Ephrata, Pennsylvania.\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nRead & Listen\nHome\nNews\nCulture\nMusic\nPodcasts & Shows\nConnect\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPress\nPublic Editor\nCorrections\nContact & Help\nAbout NPR\nOverview\nDiversity\nNPR Network\nAccessibility\nEthics\nFinances\nGet Involved\nSupport Public Radio\nSponsor NPR\nNPR Careers\nNPR Shop\nNPR Events\nNPR Extra\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nYour Privacy Choices\nText Only\nSponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor"
