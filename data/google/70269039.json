A total of 102 deputies were elected in Minsk. Some 105,000 civilians and 24,000 soldiers were eligible to vote. The election was preceded by an active election campaign, with campaign rallies, campaigns vehicles crossing through the city and buildings covered by posters for the different candidate lists. The voting occurred in orderly fashion, with voters queuing for hours from the early morning. The socialist parties formed a majority coalition after the election, with the Bundist Arn Vaynshteyn becoming the new city duma chairman.\nContemporary political context of this election: events of July 1917\nIn July 1917 (Julian calendar), the 2nd Machine Gun Regiment, supported by the Bolsheviks, refused to send men to the World War I front and marched around the factories until they had \"tens of thousands\" marching with them to the Executive Committee of the SoOfficial sourcehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Minsk_City_Duma_electionAbout this resultThis page is automatically generated and may contain information that is not correct, complete, up-to-date, or relevant to your search query.

Aspects politiques et constitutionnels: le régime autocratique face a la crise\nCerca nel libro\nIndice dei contenuti\nCita Condividi\nCitato da\npagina informativa recensito da\nRussia’s first national elections\nTerence Emmons\np. 31-44\nTesto Note di fine\nAutore\nTesto integrale\n2The electoral scheme presented in the Mirskii proposals, representation frorr the provincial zemstvos rather than by spécial élections, did not survive the review of the draft in the ministry; it was rejected by Bulygin on the grounds that it would lead to the politicization of the zemstvos, and that it would be too restrictive of the franchise in regard both to social groups (primarily the peasantry) and territories (the zemstvos existed in only thirty-four of the fifty-one provinces of European Russia).2\nThe distribution of electors’ seats among the curiae in the assembly was to be based on the total value of property held by each curial group.3\n9In the Special Conference, drawn from a broader and more heterogeneous group of dignitaries than the ministry or State Council, arguments were heard for reviving the estate-principle (soslovnost\") so as to yield a Duma with a fixed proportion of deputies from each estate (soslovie). These arguments were rejected, but a compromise was struck in the form of having the peasant electors select a separate deputy from their midst in each of the fifty-one assemblies of European Russia. Curiously, this provision was supported both by advocates of the estates idea, mostly conservative nobles, and by bureaucrats who questioned the loyalty of the nobility to the throne in view of the widespread noble participation in the zemstvo constitutionalist movement in recent months. They believed the rank-and-file peasantry would be more likely to provide conservative support for the regime.5 To keeping with this vision of a «social monarchy,» a litteracy requirement for élection for election to the Duma was also removed\ncuria\npercent of provincial electors\npeasant\n43\nlandowners\n34\nurban\n23\nAside trom the highly disproportionate per capita ratios of representation these figures imply, significant social groups would hâve gone entirely unrepresented in this system, including the industrial workers, small private (mostly peasant) landowners, and the great mass of the urban population without significant property or business affairs.6\n11Here matters stood until October17. Point Two of the October Manifeste promised to extend the franchise so as to include «those classes of the population that are now completely deprived of électoral rights.» The issue of electoral reform was engaged immediately by Count Witte, who became the country’s first prime minister on October19. The basic scheme for carrying out the promise of Point Two was readied in a few days, once again by Kryzhanovskii: it amounted to a mechanical increase in the electorate by significantly lowering qualification levels in the two property-based curiae,7and the creation of a sephrate workers’ curia, similar to, though much smaller than, the peasant curia.8\n12The main aim of the revisions was clearly stated in the conference Witte called shortly after October17: to satisfy the demands for participation by «those classes of the population which hâve been most aroused by deprivation of électoral rights; namely, the workers and persons living by intellectual labor.9» It appears that admission to the polls of a much wider group of smallholders in the landowners’ curia and of the petty bourgeoisie in the urban curia flowed more or less automatically from the decision to expand the franchise to the working class and the intelligentsia\n12 Five cities outside European Russia were also accorded special elections\n15The separate électoral assemblies that convened in the twenty largest cities of European Russia were populated by eighty electors each, except Petersburg and Moscow, which were given double allotments.12\n17In the peasant-curia élections, the preliminary stages of the elections were not clearly differentiated from the traditional village and volost’ gatherings for the election of elders and other peasant officiais. The district assemblies brought together a variety of peasants and peasant-intelligenty, most of whom were mutually unacquainted. At ail levels of the peasant-curia elections political-party allegiances or even awareness of political parties was rarely to be encountered. This is hardly surprising in view of the low rate of literacy still prevailing among the peasantry in most parts of the country; the illegality of political parties in Russia before October190513and the widespread hindrances to such agitation in rural Russia as the nascent parties could muster that were offered by local agents of the imperial administration; and the boycott of the élections by the relatively well-established parties of the revolutionary left, including the peasantophile SRs. As a resuit, most peasant electors who came to the provincial assemblies had no political-party affiliation.What by and large evoked peasant interest and participation in the elections and the institution of the Duma was the prospect of land redistribution, the perennial peasant solution to Malthusian pressures in conditions of technological stagnation.14Not that peasants were unconcerned with other issues–taxation, legal and administrative disabilities, local administrative reform, and educational opportunities especially–but in the first elections all other issues paled before the land question.15\n18For many of the same reasons, there was a large contingent of electors from the landowners’ curia that lacked any defined political orientation.Indeed, perhaps as many as30percent of the «large landowners’ electors» were of peasant origin, if not peasants strictly speaking, who had corne up from the preliminary small-holder’s meetings. In the élections these smallholders tended to display the same attitudes as their communal-peasant counterparts (most of them in fact had retained their communal allotments and would therefore participate in the peasant-curia elections as well).16A principal reason for the heavy représentation of peasant smallholders among the landowners’ electors was the diversity in political orientations prevailing among the large landowners: the center of gravity among them was probably somewhat to the right of the Octobrists in most provinces, but they were by no means uniformly conservative in political orientation.17If the large landowners had presented a solid phalanx in the district assemblies where they generally constituted a majority, they could hâve sent electors to the provincial assemblies almost cxclusively from their midst, given the voting-rules, which made it possible for any group that could maintain a consistent majority in these assemblies to take ail the positions for itself.18\n19Only in the urban curia was more or less extensive political-party agitation possible among the electorate at large: and only in the twenty largest cities with separate representation and in a few other large towns did voters actually cast ballots for slates of party candidates in a one-round election.19(This modemist departure from standard procedure had been necessitated by the great expansion of the urban electorate that came with the December11rules). Consequently, the political orientations of the electors from the urban curia were more sharply defined, the proportion of non-partisan electors much smaller, than in either of the other two significant curiae.20\ntheir ability, unmatched by any other party, tc set up local groups in virtually all the provinces of European Russia.\nTheir program.\nThe ability of the Kadets, operating within the structure of the elections described above, to set up coalitions with other groups of electors in the provincial assemblies.\nSocial-democrats\n6\nKadet bloc*\n143\nOctobrist bloc\n17\nRight\n6\nNon-party\n193**\nOther\n19\n24 1. Between150and200political organizations, many calling themselves «parties» (partiia), but also «unions» (soiuz), «conunittees» (komitet), «brotherhoods» (bratstvo), «veche,» and so on, came into existence between October1905 and the time of the first elections, which were held in March-April, 1906, for the purpose of competing in those élections. Most of them were very small and ephemeral types of what Du verger calls «cadre parties» (partis de cadres)24: they had no aspirations of elaborating programs, recruiting membership, or setting up permanent party networks; they were formed for the sole purpose of supporting a candidate or group of candidates in the elections. A few did not even aspire to put up their own candidates, but aimed to mobilize a articular ethnie or confessional group in support of a party with a program acceptable to them. Most of these organizations were urban: the State of communications, administrative hindrances to political agitation in the countryside, and the structure of the electoral process–ail conspired to make pre-election compaigning an ahnost entirely urban phenomenon.25\n25In this vast array of political organizations, only four could claim anything beyond strictly local, or at best regional, status: the Kadets (Konstitutsionno-Demokraticheskaia Partiia); the Octobrist (Soiuz17-go Oktiabria); the Trade-Industry Party (Torgovo-promyshlennaia Partiia); and the Party of Legal Order (Partiia Pravovogo Poriadka). Of these four, only the Kadets and the Octobrists had networks, however loosely woven, covering most of European Russia.26Of the two, the Kadets’ network was considerably denser, with at least two hundred provincial, town, and district committees in place before the elections27; and their membership was far greater: total Kadet membership has been estimàted at about 100,000by early January, 1906, and it may have reached120,000by the eve of the elections. Estimates of total Octobrist membership for the same period range from10,000to24,348.28\n27The crucial importance of the zemstvos, in particular, in laying the institutional foundations of the Kadet party can hardly be overemphasized.29The founders of the Union of Liberation were mostly long-time zemstvo activists or professional men with zemstvc connections; the Union of Zemstvo Constitutionalists was an important constituent part of the Union; and «Third Element» (tretii element) employées of the zemstvos played an important part in setting up local Liberationist groups in many towns. The geographical distribution of Kadet groups betrays the importance of the zemstvos for the establishment of the Kadet party network: it was densest in the zemstvo provinces. The norm there was a provincial committee in the provincial capital and committees in three or four district towns; in some zemstvo provinces there were committees in every district. Outside zemstvo Russia, the Kadet network was very thin, usually confined to a party group established by Liberationist professional men in the provincial capital.30\n29In this part of their strategy, the Kadets enjoyed considérable early success: the size of their membership rivalled anything the revolutionary left could boast at the time; and the sources of recruitment were those anticipated. If the «local leaders», the cadre groups that set up local committees, tended to be predominantly zemstvo activists and professional men from the Unions, at least in the Russian heartland, the rank and file was predominantly from the lower, «démocratie» intelligentsia, with an admixture of craftsmen, clerks and shopkeepers.32\n30To these éléments of their strategy must be added the Kadets’ nationalities strategy. The Kadet leaders were quite aware of the intensive mobilization that had been going on in recent months among the non-Russian nationalities of the Empire. The September1905zemstvo congress, the first to be attended by delegaüons from the non-zemstvo provinces, had been bombarded with petitions from Polish Ukrainian, Baltic, and other nationalities groups.33The Kadet leaders, who were just at that time drawing up their draft party program, added to the bid for support from the broader reaches of the intelligentsia (and through it, eventually perhaps, from the popular masses) the bid for the support of nationalities groups capable of mobilizing considérable followings across class lines over an area of the Empire that accounted for a considerable portion of the Duma’s seats under the electoral law of December11,1905.34\n31The Kadet strategy, together with the compétition with the revolutionary left for the allegiance of the non-party socialist intelligentsia it implied, explains a great deal about the Kadet program, with its agrarian platform calling for large-scale expropriation of gentry estates for distribution among the peasants, a package of other socio-economic reforms remarkably radical for an ostensibly liberal party, and a special article devoted to democratie local self-government and local autonomy, with special reference to Poland and to the restoration of the Finnish constitution.35\n35Outside the western perimeter, the only other significant régional organization in European Russia was based on Muslim/Turkic nationalism. The Muslim National Union (Ittifak) was particularly influential in the elections in the provinces of Kazan, Ufa, and, to a lesser extent, in Perm, although it was active over a much larger area. In the provincial assemblies, members of the Union from the several curiae generally cooperated with the Kadets. The Union, founded in August 1905by representatives of the Volga Tatar intelligentsia, mostly professional men from Kazan, had adopted a formal resolution in favor of cooperation with the Kadets at its second congress held in mid-January, 1906. Many of its leading figures were members of the Kadet party.38\n36In sum, the Kadets, relying on their agrarian and nationalities programs, emerged as the pre-eminent party in the First Duma by sweeping the big-city elections and by forming winning coalitions, in the winner-take-all arrangements of the provincial assembly élections, with non-party peasants and with mobilized nationalities groups. The political conséquences of the first élections lie beyond the scope of this paper. I should like merely to suggest here that the circumstances of the Kadet victory explain a great deal about the conflict between the Duma and the govemment that issued in the coup d’État of June3, 1907. Their dependence on peasant support reinforced their commitment to a program of radical land reform that could not be accommodated to the govemment’s emerging plan for conservative agrarian reform. The agrarian question was the most important substantive issue at stake in the conflict that led to the Third of June. By the same token, the Kadets found their most reliable support in the Dumas, particularly in the Second Duma, among the national minority groups. Some of these, like the large Polish group (with thirty-four deputies from the Congress Kingdom alone), were not enthusiastic about the Kadet agrarian program, but supported it because of the Kadets’ nationalities program. The agrarian and nationalities questions were in this way inseparably intertwined. It was no accident that the two groups whose représentation was most dramatically undercut by the révision of the électoral law on June3, 1907, were precisely the peasants and the Poles (along with other national minorities).39\n39The Kadets success in the first elections, quite out of proportion to the size of their popular following or even their representation in the provincial assemblies was thus the product of a particular historical moment, one of the most salient features of which was the relatively low degree of political mobilization obtaining among the electorate, especially the peasant electorate; and of the structure of the electoral system. The importance of the latter can be judged by the fact that the Kadets still did extremely well in the second élections. Would they hâve done as well had the first elections been held on the basis of universal, direct suffrage, as the Kadets and all parties to their left wished? Ironically, the answer is, almost certainly not. Although it is difficult to imagine how elections held with universal, direct suffrage would have functioned at that time, in the absence of widespread mobilization or a System for the preliminary forwarding of a limited number of candidates identifiable to the electorate at large by generally known political labels, it is, because of those very conditions, extremely unlikely that any single party could hâve taken more than a small minority of the Duma seats. It seems more likely that the Duma would hâve been quite variegated politically, with a considerable number of deputies identified with the local cadre or patronage parties that had sprung up in such profusion before the first élections. Perhaps Dmitri Shipov, that most prominent zemstvo man among the founders of the Octobrist party, had more than half a point when he told Nicholas II at the Tsarskoe Selo conférence called to consider révisions in the électoral law after the October Manifesto that the left would dominate the Duma if the government’s curial project were adopted (as it was on December11), but that Octobrists would be elected to the Duma under a universal suffrage law.44\nNote di fine\n1 D.

Printed ballots, often clipped from newspapers, were widely used in these elections.\n20 See note17.\n21 Drawn from the source cited in note17, with certain amendations and corrections of arithmetic errors.\n22 The lists were compiled by roll call. Voting was by the same procedure as in the district assemblies described above. Theoretically, an elector could vote for all the candidates. To be sure of success, a group’s adherents had to vote for its candidates and no more. They often failed to do so, and multiple ballottings were commonplace.\n23 Author’s compilation from local sources. The deputies £rom the special city election: are not included here.\n24 M. Duverger, Les partis politiques, Paris.\n25 Administrative hindrances were far more widespread than is usually understood. The novelty of the situation, the still ambiguous status of the parties, the widespread application of the emergency legislation of1881and of martial law at this time, and a lack of clear directives from the central government all conspired tc encourage local police and administrators to hew to tradition.\n26 The Kadets lacked représentation altogether only in the Baltic provinces of Kurland and Estland (there were local parties affiliated with the Kadets there, however); the Octobrists lacked représentation in the same two provinces, as well as in Viatka and Ufa.\n27 From the author’s research on party networks, based on party archives and local newspapers.\n28 P.

The two assemblies were supposed to help resolve the multilayered political, economic, and military crises of the First World War and the Revolution by consolidating a Russian postimperial political community and establishing a solid government. The debates demonstrated that grievances and antagonism, which were articulated in terms of class and nationality, made the idea of a broad nationalist coalition unpopular, since it would halt agrarian and other reforms and continue the negligence of non-Russian groups. Furthermore, those who still called for all-Russian national or civic unity split on the issue of community-building. The top-down, homogenizing and bottom-up, composite approaches proved irreconcilable and precluded a compromise between non-socialist and moderate socialist groups. The two assemblies hence failed to ensure a peaceful continuation of the postimperial transformation and did not lead to a broad coalition against right and left radicalism. The divisions, which were articulated in the two assemblies, translated into the main rifts of the Russian Civil War.\nKeywords Russian Revolutionempiresocialismnationalismclassnationality\nType\nArticle\nInformation\nNationalities Papers\n,\nVolume 51\n,\nIssue 2\n, March 2023 , pp. 446 - 468 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/nps.2021.73\nCreative Commons\nThis is an Open Access article, distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nCopyright\n© The Author(s), 2021.
