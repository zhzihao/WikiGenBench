At the end, youll probably have to do some exams on spanish law, in order to be granted the complete title reconigtion...No bar exam needed (for now)...the spanish law already mentions such need, but its not being enforced (until 2009 or 2010 - not sure about the specific dates)...Anyway, if you had an EU law degree or if you were an EU lawyer, things would be easier, due to EU directives on superior degrees recognition...For example, if you were a french lawyer, you could go to spain, ask for your lawyer professional title to be recognized, and in a few months have that recognition, without any \"academic\" exams envolved in such process...Cheers, I hope my info helps...if you need to know anything else just let me know!Pedro\nWell, the \"homologacion\" (have your law degree recognized in Spain) is not a difficult process...Basically you present all your documentation regarding your law studies and then you wait and wait and wait (can take between 6 months to 2 years, from what I was told)...\nPedro\nquote\nParvez\n2\n4\nPosted Jun 18, 2008 09:22\n0\nCan anybody provide with some websites which gives information to foriegn lawyers, as to how to get admitted to Spanish Bar.I am from India and have cleared QLTT, am I eligible to obtain the benefit of equivalency procedures as outlined in EU directive 89/48, if I intend to practice in EU\nI am from India and have cleared QLTT, am I eligible to obtain the benefit of equivalency procedures as outlined in EU directive 89/48, if I intend to practice in EU\nquote\nUrhilf\n7\n14\nPosted Jun 18, 2008 11:07\n0\nI am from India and have cleared QLTT, am I eligible to obtain the benefit of equivalency procedures as outlined in EU directive 89/48, if I intend to practice in EU</blockquote>\nSpanish Ministery of Education - generic info about the \"homologación\" process - http://www.mepsyd.es/mecd/jsp/plantilla.jsp?id=3&area=titulos\nquote\nmikeadyla\n25\n50\nPosted Aug 18, 2008 19:41\n0\nquote\nReply to Post\nReply to Post\nFollow Thread\nSave\nCancel\nFeatured Schools\nUniversity of Reading School of Law\nLL.M. programs in popular areas, including International Law and Human Rights\nUniversity of Birmingham\nAdvance your career potential with a 100% online postgraduate degree from the University of Birmingham\nUniversity of Minnesota Law School\nStudy for an LL.M. at a top-tier US law school\nRead FAQ\nPopular Discussion Topics\nPost-LLM Careers\nVisa Issues\nTOEFL / IELTS\nCoronavirus / COVID-19\nBar Exam\nLetters of Recommendation\nScholarships / Financial Aid\nTax LLM\nApplication\nHot Discussions\nOxford 2023-2024 BCL/MSCs/MJUR/MPHIL/MLF Applicants\nDec 31, 2023\n143,071\n1003\nLSE LLM 2024-25\nJan 15 11:22 AM\n10,040\n80\nGeorgetown LLM 2024/2025 applicants\n9 minutes ago\n11,137\n75\nOxford 2024-2025 BCL/MSCs/MJUR/MPHIL/MLF\n1 hour ago\n6,464\n58\nDuke Law LLM 2024-2025\n21 hours ago\n4,265\n39\nHAPPY NEW YEAR\nDec 31, 2023\n2,169\n24\nUCLA LLM 2024-2025\nJan 17 05:34 AM\n1,863\n15\nCambridge PhD in Law 2024 Fall\nJan 18 03:07 AM\n1,146\n10\nTopics\nGeneral Forum\nUSA\nUnited Kingdom / Ireland\nEurope\nAsia\nAustralia / New Zealand\nCanada\nLatin America\nAfrica / Middle East\nDistance Learning\nTOEFL / IELTS\nScholarships / Funding\nBar Exam\nJD\nJSD / SJD\nRecently Active Users\n11\n1\n27\n4\nEragon\n1\n1\nchi3l_\n12\n4\n25\n20\nagshivi\n1\n2\nekhfbfe\n2\n3\nBruceEx\n1\n1\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nTerms of Use\nCookie Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nInformation\nFeatured LLM Programs\nLLM News\nLLM Articles\nMBA Programs\nOnline MBA Programs\nExecutive Courses\nSubmit LLM Program\nSearch LLM Programs\nGo to Advanced Search\nSubscribe to the LLM GUIDE Newsletter\nReceive the latest news and tips\nSubscribe Now\n© 2001–2024\nPritzwalks – LLM GUIDE – Master of Laws\n(LL.M.)
