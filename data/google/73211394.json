It complementsthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides the legal framework under which all human activities in the ocean take place.“President of the Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have signed the High Seas Treaty on behalf of the EU, leading by example other countries to do the same. It is a historic day for the protection of the High Seas!” said Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius. “But we need to keep working towards a swift ratification, with the hope that the treaty can enter into force by the June 2025 UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France.”The text of the treaty was agreed in March 2023 and formally adopted on 19 June, by consensus, at UN Headquarters in New York. It will enter into force after 60 ratifications.A key role for the EUThe EU and its Member States have played a key role in reaching the agreement, by leading a 'High Ambition Coalition' on BBNJ of 52 countries, committed at the highest political level.The EU has also pledged to support the treaty’s implementation in particular by developing countries from the EU Global Ocean Programme.It has invited members of the High Ambition Coalition on BBNJ to do the same within their capabilities.Next stepsOnce ratified, the High Seas Treaty will allow the establishment of marine protected areas in the high seas at global level, safeguarding the ocean from human pressures in a major contribution to reducing climate change, to protecting biodiversity and achieving the objective to protect at least 30% of the planet by 2030. The treaty thus addresses a blaring gap in ocean protection, as only about 1% of the high seas is currently protected. The treaty also sets a framework for a fair and equitable sharing of monetary and non-monetary benefits from marine genetic resources, and for capacity building and transfer of marine technologies to developing countries, as well as a voluntary fund to support developing countries to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal 14 on 'Life Below Water'.BackgroundAreas beyond national jurisdiction comprise the high seas and the seabed beyond national jurisdiction.They contain marine resources and biodiversity and provide invaluable ecological, economic, social, cultural, scientific and food security benefits to humanity. However, they are under mounting pressure from pollution, overexploitation, climate change and biodiversity loss. For better addressing these challenges, and in view of future increasing demands for marine resources (for food, medication, energy, for example), it appeared necessary to establish a new treaty.This High Seas Treaty should also be instrumental for increasing coherence, coordination and synergies among the ocean-related activities carried out by many organisations and stakeholders, thus contributing to a more holistic management of activities in the high seas.More informationSignatoriesProtecting the ocean, time for action\nDetails\nPublication date20 September 2023AuthorDirectorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter\nShare this page\nOceans and fisheriesThis site is managed by: Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesContact usContact the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesAccessibilityFollow usFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubeNewsletterAbout usDirectorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesRelated sitesEnvironmentResearch and innovationMore information on:Food, Farming, FisheriesContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResources for partnersLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice"

This Treaty is key to protect the ocean, promote equity and fairness, tackle environmental degradation, fight climate change, and prevent biodiversity loss in the high seas. It has been a priority for the European Union and its Member States, that have led negotiations at global level through the BBNJ High Ambition Coalition.The adoption of this Treaty, also known as “BBNJ” (biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction), is an historic achievement marking the successful end of more than a decade of multilateral work. This agreement is also a welcome addition to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which provides the legal framework under which all activities in the ocean take place.The Treaty will enter into force when 60 parties ratify it. The European Union has committed to support the Treaty’s ratification and early implementation through the EU Global Ocean Programme of 40 million euros and has invited members of the High Ambition Coalition to do the same within their capabilities.Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, VirginijusSinkevičius, said:This is a major win for biodiversity - a game changer for the protection of the ocean and the sustainable use of its marine resources. The European Union and its Member States are committed to signing and ratifying the BBNJ Agreement as soon as possible. We urge others to do so too, as we hope the BBNJ Treaty will receive universal ratification and swiftly enter into forceWhat the Treaty will bring – in a nutshellThe BBNJ Treaty sets up a procedure to establish large-scale marine protected areas in the high seas. This facilitates the achievement of the target to effectively conserve and manage 30% of land and sea by 2030, which was agreed in December .2022 within the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.It establishes the sharing of benefits from marine genetic resources and foresees capacity building and the transfer of marine technology between the parties.It contains clear rules to conduct environmental impact assessments, with the right checks and balances, before running activities in the high seas.BackgroundThe high seas provide invaluable ecological, economic, social and food security benefits to humanity and are in need of urgent protection.Areas beyond national jurisdiction cover nearly two-thirds of the world’s ocean, comprising the high seas and the Area (the seabed beyond national jurisdiction). They contain marine resources and biodiversity and provide invaluable ecological, economic, social, cultural, scientific and food-security benefits to humanity. However, they are under mounting pressure from pollution (including noise), overexploitation, climate change and decreasing biodiversity.In March 2023, globalnegotiations concluded on the landmark Treaty of the High Seas.More informationCommission website on the BBNJ negotiations ‘Protecting the ocean, time for action’Press release of March 2023 on the global agreement on protection and sustainable use of resources and biodiversity in high seasTreaty of the High Seas to protect ocean biodiversity\nDetails\nPublication date19 June 2023AuthorDirectorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries\nSubscribe to our monthly newsletter\nShare this page\nOceans and fisheriesThis site is managed by: Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesContact usContact the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesAccessibilityFollow usFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubeNewsletterAbout usDirectorate-General for Maritime Affairs and FisheriesRelated sitesEnvironmentResearch and innovationMore information on:Food, Farming, FisheriesContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResources for partnersLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice"

Why is that?\nLeticia Carvalho (LC): The new agreement provides, for the first time, a legal basis for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the high seas or areas that are beyond national jurisdiction. This is a major step forward in protecting biodiversity in line with the aims of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Kunming-Montreal Global Framework for Biodiversityand for sharing the benefits that arise from the utilization of marine resources in a fair and equitable manner.\nSome have said the high seas have essentially been a lawless place when it comes to conservation. How does this treaty change that?\nLC: For decades, the high seas have been governed in a fragmented way. While global bodies exist to regulate many of the human activities occurring in the high seas – like shipping, seabed mining and fisheries – to date there has been limited coherence and coordination between them. At the same time, new activities, such as bioprospecting, were not covered. This has resulted in an ocean governance structure that has proven inadequate in stemming environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. The treaty puts a new framework in place to address marine resource conservation, sustainable use and management, and offers new governance tools and institutional mechanisms for decision-making and equitable benefit sharing.\nLeticia Carvalho, UNEP\nTopics\nOcean & coasts\nNature action\nBiodiversity\nRestoration\nFurther Resources\nUNEP’s work on oceans and seas\nAddressing Marine Plastics: A Systemic Approach – Recommendations for Actions\nRelated Content\nSpeech\nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: How to halt and reverse biodiversity loss\nVideo\nNature driving economic transformation\nRelated Sustainable Development Goals\nGoal 14\nGoal 14: Life Below Water\n+\nGoal 15\nGoal 15: Life on Land\n+\nLearn about our work\nSign up for updates\nGet involved\nGovernance & Leadership\nExecutive Director\nDeputy Executive Director\nSenior Management Team\nCommittee of Permanent Representatives\nEnvironment Assembly - UNEA\nFunding & Partners\nOverview\nCivil Society\nMember States\nPrivate Sector\nEnvironment Fund\nGlobal Environment Facility\nGreen Climate Fund\nCentres collaborating with UNEP\nStructure\nDivisions and Offices\nEvaluation Office\nSecretariats and Conventions\nKey Documents\nAnnual Report\nMedium Term Strategy\nProgramme of Work and Budget\nSpeeches\nResources\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) on Plastic Pollution\nKnowledge Repository\nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nPolicies & Strategies\nProjects – Open Data Portal\nSustainability at UNEP\nSustainable Development Goals\nUNEA Monitoring and Reporting Portal\nWorld Environment Situation Room\nRegional Presence\nAfrica\nAsia and the Pacific\nEurope\nLatin America and the Caribbean\nNew York Office\nNorth America\nWest Asia\nAdvocacy\nBeat Pollution\nChampions of the Earth\nClean Seas\nFaith for Earth\nGoodwill Ambassadors\nUN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration\nUN International Days\nUNEP at 50\nYoung Champions of the Earth\nMedia\nMedia Centre\nSocial Media\nNews, Stories & Speeches\nWork with us\nCalls for Proposals\nJob Vacancies\nSubscribe to the UNEP newsletter\n© 2024 UNEP Terms of Use PrivacyReport Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us"

But what is needed to ensure that this historic agreement actually brings desired results? Shutterstock26 October 2023Around two-thirds of the Earth's ocean lies beyond national boundaries. This expansive area is referred to as the “high seas”, “international waters”, or “areas beyond national jurisdiction.” The high seas typically start at a distance of 200 nautical miles from the coast, and while being distant from the immediate surroundings of coastal communities, their rich biodiversity is not immune to the impact of human activities.The high seas are home to an intricate tapestry of life that plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and balance of our planet - from species of high commercial and societal importance such as tuna and whales, to unique, unexplored ecosystems such as deep hydrothermal vents and seamounts. From the moment ships embarked on transoceanic voyages, these once remote and unknown areas that belong to nobody and everybody at the same time have become especially vulnerable to overexploitation, habitat destruction, and unsustainable practices.Charting a new course to protect biodiversity in the high seasA growing recognition of the critical role this vast oceanic realm plays in our global ecosystem led to a rise in international efforts to safeguard marine biodiversity in international waters. Following decades of negotiations, these efforts finally reached a historical milestone with the recent adoption of the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Agreement. Also known as the “High Seas Treaty”, it is the first international legally binding instrument to conserve and sustainably manage marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.This long-awaited agreement provides a legal framework for addressing various stressors affecting the marine environment in the high seas. It will play a crucial role in achieving the recent ambitious “30x30” initiative to protect 30% of marine ecosystems by 2030.As of October 2023, the BBNJ/”High Seas Treaty” has been signed by representatives fromover 80 countries. However, while Member States celebrate the signing of the Treaty, a key question remains -how do we ensure that this historic agreement effectively safeguards marine biodiversity? ShutterstockA fit for purpose ocean observing system to support BBNJThe successful implementation of the agreement comes with the challenge of understanding the complex dynamics of ocean life, which requires coordinated monitoring at a global scale to understand current states and trends. The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) plays a critical role in supporting this endeavor.GOOS, led by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, has developed a global framework of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs) - key biological, physical and biogeochemical measurements to monitor and track the state of the ocean and its variability. Under this framework, there is a comprehensive set of 12 EOVs dedicated to biodiversity, from microbes and phytoplankton, to seabirds and marine mammals. This is the foundation of a fit for purpose ocean observing system to support the BBNJ agreement.“Three of the main components of the agreement relate to Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and genetic resources,” says Karen Evans, Co-Chair of the GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Expert Panel. “In the case of MPAs, we need to knowwhatwe are protecting in the first place, and to monitor it through time in order to know if the MPA is actually effective. Similarly, we cannot conduct an EIA without data that showswhatis being impacted andhow. As for genetic resources, we cannot manage them without first identifying them,” she further explains.Underpinning the biodiversity EOVs are networks of scientific communities taking coordinated EOV observations of marine life. Information on these various communities and the biodiversity EOV observations they are collecting can be found in the interactiveGOOS BioEco Portal.Critical marine biodiversity observing gaps remainWhile significant progress has been made through these collaborative efforts, there are still critical gaps in our understanding of marine life - particularly in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Alarming statistics from the BioEco Portal suggest that only 7% of our ocean’s surface is monitored in a sustained way, and the accessibility of observations critical for supporting the BBNJ agreement remains very limited.The dark ocean depths below 200 meters constitute the largest portion of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Despite this, deep ocean observations are notably scarce and most deep ocean biodiversity and ecosystems remain unobserved. TheDeep Ocean Observing Strategy, a GOOS Project endorsed as a UN Ocean Decade Programme, aims to address these gaps by broadening and improving cross-disciplinary coordination of deep ocean observing. GOOS BioEco PortalAccessible observations to meet diverse needsEnsuring that the EOV observations are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and reach those that need them is part of GOOS’s core mission. This is done in close collaboration with the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) - another program of the IOC/UNESCO that hosts global biological data sets and provides a key service in facilitating free and open access to data and information on marine life. Through this partnership, GOOS ensures that the biodiversity EOV observations are integrated and made freely available through the OBIS platform.“New discoveries and mapping of marine life resources can be facilitated through collective and sustained observing efforts, with the coordination facilitated by GOOS and its members. This way, we can ensure that marine life observations are accessible to all, and therefore can be delivered into the BBNJ agreement framework and meet the diverse needs of nations,” says Gabrielle Canonico, Co-Chair of the GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Expert Panel.Bringing all hands on deck to boost marine biodiversity observationsThe GOOS Biology and Ecosystems Expert Panel highlights that it is important to engage all nations in sustained and coordinated collecting of observations that are needed to support not only national priorities, but also those of international agreements such as the BBNJ. These observations can then be integrated into a global system through GOOS.GOOS coordinates the collection of observations globally through its 13ocean observing networks, as well as at national and regional scales through its 15Regional Alliances, and 76 GOOSNational Focal Points. By delegating a GOOS National Focal Point, each country can contribute to the global observing system and ensure communication between GOOS and the national ocean observing organizations. This coordination framework is key to facilitating sharing of knowledge, capacity and technology - contributing to the fourth key element of the BBNJ agreement which focuses on capacity development and technology transfer.“GOOS looks forward to working with nations collaboratively to focus on further expanding the global collection of biological and ecological ocean observations,” says Joanna Post, the Director of GOOS. “Through the IOC-UNESCO, GOOS offers ongoing support to deliver the operational information nations need for the effective implementation of this crucial BBNJ agreement, and for sustainable ocean management.”This is the second article from the GOOS series on observing marine biodiversity under multiple stressors.
