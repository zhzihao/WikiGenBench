Accordingly as the Returning Officer for Argyll and Bute, I have made arrangements for the Notice of Election to be published on Monday 15th August 2022. This will be available on the council’s dedicated Elections web page.Polling Day will be Thursday 29th September 2022 – the council meeting scheduled for that day will also go ahead as planned.Voters who are registered in the Kintyre and the Islands ward only will be eligible to vote, and will be asked to elect one councillor to fill the current vacancy.The pre-election period starts on Monday following the publication of the Notice and there are particular requirements and restrictions for council staff during this time. This is to ensure that no individual or political party standing for election can make use of council resources – including staff – for their own political purposes.It is important that employees are familiar with all issues associated with the pre-election period. The council has drawn up this document, Pre-Election Guidelines for Staff, for those requiring more information.Any employee who is unsure whether something which they have been asked to do is political, or could be interpreted as such, should refer the matter to their line manager and ultimately, if necessary, their Head of Service or Executive Director.It is possible that you may be asked questions about the election in the course of your work. Information will be available on the Hub to help you answer or direct any queries that you or anyone else have.The council’s Elections Team is also available to assist and can be contacted on 01546 603264 or elections@argyll-bute.gov.ukBelow are some useful web links to find out more about elections and voting:www.gov.uk/register-to-vote – online voter registrationwww.electoralcommission.org.uk – the independent body which oversees elections in the UK and where you can find out information about all aspects of elections and voting.Issued on behalf of Pippa Milne, Returning OfficerFriday 12th August 2022More staff news New Pilates class in Helensburgh January 12, 2024 A new class starts in the annex at Helensburgh and Lomond Civic Centre on Monday evenings.

Thanks also to the public for believing in me, supporting me and voting for me.\n“I am extremely sad that David has not been elected. He has been a huge help over the last year, but I am looking forward to serving on this council for the next five years.\n“I also look forward to being part of something which I hope is the best council yet.”\nCllr Campbell-Sturgess added: “I seem to be the last SNP councillor to be elected today. I am not sure about results elsewhere, but here it has been a good day for the SNP.\n“Thanks to the electorate of Helensburgh and Lomond South for putting their trust in me.”\nCllr Kennedy was not in attendance at the count, but thanks were extended on his behalf.\nThe election took place under the single transferrable vote system.
