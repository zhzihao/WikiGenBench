        "text": "Recap: ‘Boardwalk Empire’ Season 4, Episode 4 ‘All In’ – IndieWire\n×\nElsewhere, William Thompson’s (Ben Rosenfield) revenge scheme horribly backfires. Embarrassed by his peers when caught with a boner when making out with the object of affection last episode, the son of Eli Thompson (Shea Whigham) wants to one up his college nemesisHenry (Josh Caras), despite Dad’s recent imperious monologue of keeping his nose clean and getting an education. William and a his classmate Clayton (Owen Campbell) spike Henry’sdrink with milk of magnesia—William having scored some of dad’s booze and becoming the college’s de facto mini alcohol supplier—but the chemistry is off. While Henry is embarrassed with projectile diarrhea in front of his classmates, the brew has a more potent effect and later that evening he’s found dead by his classmates—his entire insides burned up and his mouth bleeding out profusely. This is a one way ticket to expulsion for William and if it goes this way, there will be a sure fire hell-to-pay consequence from his overbearing father.\nOver in Harlem, in his earnest efforts to switch teams and join forces with Dr. Narcisse (Jeffrey Wright), Dunn Purnsley (Erik LaRay Harvey), Chalky White’s (Michael K. Williams) lieutenant makes a blunder—showing up at Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association to do business. Offended he would sully the establishment with illegal dealings, the particular Narcisse admonishes him. But later, after selling a story about the preservation of the race and the difference between the Negro and the “nigger,” Purnsley makes it up to Narcisse by pummeling some sap. While Purnsley is swayed by the persuasive aesthete, it appears he’s trading one boss for another, but don’t be surprised if this is some grand ploy by Narcisse and Purnsley is just a pawn who ends up with the short end of the stick.\nSpeaking of chess piece writing—narrative moves laid down only in service of something further down the road in the plot—it appears that Eddie Kessler’s (Anthony Laciura) promotion hasn’t been much of a character development device at all. In the episode’s least successful storyline, Kessler goes to Chicago on business to meet Ralph Capone (Domenick Lombardozzi). The episode takes pains to spend time with the two men convivially breaking bread and getting to know each other; even pausing for Kessler to talk about himself and the pride he has in his new position. But if you were asking “what is the point of all this?” It appear to be a long-winded tangent in service of setting Kessler up as a patsy. Earlier in the episode, J. Edgar Hoover (Eric Ladin) is being debriefed by undercover FBI Agent Warren Knox (Brian Geraghty). Knox contends that Nucky, Rothstein, Capone, Masseria and many other criminal organizations across the nation are in business cahoots, and therefore in conspiracy together. Hoover asks: how are we going to infiltrate these disparate organizations to link them all together? Find them at their “weakest link” Knox says and that becomes Kessler when he gets nabbed by the Feds at the end of the episode. If he talks as much as the G-Men want, it could be the beginning of lights out for Nucky.\nBits And Pieces:\n— There’s a whole other storyline between Al and Frank Capone (Stephen Graham and Morgan Spector) with Nelson Van Alden/George Mueller (Michael Shannon), but it doesn’t say very much other than showing the former FBI agent how ruthless the Chicago thugs are and how very much in the middle he is.\n— Gillian Darmody (Gretchen Mol) and Richard Harrow’s (Jack Huston) story lines take a backseat this episode as well.\nRead More: Boardwalk Empire Jeffrey Wright Michael K.

Though there are always a few violent outbursts waiting in the wings, and every season tends to build to a major standoff, by and large, the show opts for a deliberate, meandering structure where narrative momentum will always come second to a scene of characters casually sniping at one another in a beautifully art-directed room followed by someone getting beaten up to meet blood quota. This show is framed like a sweeping drama about the ruthlessness of history; in practice, it’s a tone poem with a body count.AdvertisementDuring the build to each season’s conclusion, the drama of the show hinges on getting viewers invested in the individual characters, real or fictitious, and the moments that illuminate them as people rather than the milestones on their various Wikipedia pages. And the small character moments on this show are one of its greatest strengths. Its cast is almost uniformly top-notch, thematic arcs build slowly but are often rewarding, and the show regularly allows a character to unspool at length, with the sort of internal logic that makes someone repeating mistakes a human failing rather than a plot failing. (The “Nucky Tries to Handle it With Money He Pretends to Despise” tic alone has been running four seasons straight.) But this also means quieter beats can be more engaging than larger ones, and narrative push can get lost.AdvertisementLast season had a certain desperate drive because Gyp Rosetti was haunting everyone’s footsteps, an ever-more-unstable antagonist who actually had the power to make his enemies circle their wagons. In his wake, this season has been an exploration of the ripple effect that follows such a dramatic standoff. Chalky’s pushing through and on, and the Capones are taking every advantage they can get, but after Nucky’s wringer of a year, he’s aimless (so adrift he’s actually making plans this episode to move to Florida), ever dreaming of having an operation that runs itself, while surrounded by colleagues who are more than happy to step into the void. This slow-motion ripple effect has made the season so far a solid study of the effects of changing roles on this community of characters, but occasionally, this focus on the minutiae becomes momentum-sapping languor.“All In” is no different. At its best, it presents beautifully-acted central characters making small mistakes that feel suitably momentous; at its worst, it’s an episode in which we see movement without drive in secondary plots that have been working to stay relevant until they actually become relevant. A third of the way through a season, this is an episode that has pivotal character beats and yet still feels like it’s trying to establish many of its arcs. When it’s good, it’s very, very good. When it’s not, someone you barely remember from a subplot no one cares about takes two scenes just to die of magnesium poisoning.AdvertisementThat would be Henry, by the way, Temple’s class bully (remember him?), whom Willy tries to prank in retaliation for getting caught last week on second base, and instead feeds a fatal dose of milk of magnesia. If this gets Willy kicked out of school and put on the fast track to the family business, that might be for the best, though not out of any particular investment in his character. And if he does go, he’ll be joining up as a desperate kid who doesn’t know when to stop, and the whole thing will probably break Eli’s heart, given his investment in his son and his determination to steer Willy free of the moonshine life. (In a father-son chat, Eli gets in a matter-of-factly heartbreaking, “You think I’m happy?”)The flip side of this is one of the most insightful scenes of the season, as Rothstein agrees to bankroll the Tampa venture, and, unable to sit in a room by himself, demands he and Nucky take each other’s measure over a hand of poker. Everything leading to the game is complicated, right down to Chalky coming up to the office to announce Rothstein’s asked for Nucky (a messenger-boy role we know by now will be remembered and won’t sit well) and Rothstein making clear the game is a test of worth.AdvertisementAnd then losing.Arnold Rothstein so far in the series has been a paragon of success, strategy, and self-control, and watching him lose at something on multiple fronts infuses the entire last act with a certain breathless dread. Turning the game into a needling contest, Rothstein’s need to win has nothing to do with the astronomical kitty, and Nucky’s no fool: When he suggests there are other games, and Rothstein answers with a chilling, “No. There’s only the game you’re in now,” Nucky has the face of a man who already knew it. It’s a brilliant, tightly-wound picture of a man quietly imploding in a way that’s more chilling the more of him you know.AdvertisementBut it’s not Nucky, or even Rothstein, who’s all in: It’s Meyer Lansky. Sitting at Rothstein’s elbow, he alternately takes shit from the strangers at the table and tries to take care of Rothstein’s image in the absence of Rothstein’s usual self-awareness. The whole scene goes silent for a long moment after he whispers to Rothstein, “Wouldn’t it be best if people don’t see you like this?” It seems genuinely meant, as Rothstein is certainly smart enough to take the advice, and Lansky even stays behind to do damage control. (“He doesn’t like to lose,” he explains to Nucky, who delivers a perfectly Nucky, “Nobody likes to. We all have to learn how.”)But when it’s obvious Nucky’s going to cut Rothstein out of the deal, Lansky doesn’t miss a beat before putting himself on the table for the Tampa investment. Nucky, who has had some hard lessons about how people can surprise you, asks for guarantee of character via personal anecdote. Lansky tells a childhood story about how he came to work with Luciano (Luciano stole his lunch money; Lansky spat in his face and took the subsequent fighting until Luciano invited him into the gang). This Lansky is quiet, confident, and just for a moment, childishly gleeful about this turn in his fortunes. Then he beats to death the man who insulted him at poker, because he’s happy to salvage Rothstein’s pride, but determined to keep his own.AdvertisementAnd in a prime example of the character eddies which the show enjoys, Eddie Kessler gets one of the sweetest episode arcs in a while, with a clandestine assignment that earns him pride points (“I’m not a chauffeur, sir,” he gets to say, with the look of a man who’s been waiting years to say it), and then having an uneventful evening shooting the shit with Ralph Capone over steaks, then hanging out at his local bar for some bragging about his promotion and a few verses of “O du wunderschöner deutscher Rhein.” Shot like the final self-affirming montage of a feel-good holiday movie (Finding Eddie, opening this Christmas), it’s the kind of character snapshot Boardwalk Empire revels in. It’s also, as expected, a doomed venture: Agent Knox, having sworn, “I”ll find the weakest link in Thompson’s operation, and I’ll break it,” singles out Kessler for the privilege, and he’s carted away from the station to parts unknown. One of the most poignant moments of the episode, then, is Nucky coming home late, calling for an Eddie who isn’t there.Beside these two beautifully-sketched character pieces, the other subplots feel natural but somehow superfluous. Narcisse effortlessly pins Dunn even more firmly under this thumb, though it strains credulity to think he would rely on Dunn enough to lean his Atlantic City drug trade on him. And Van Alden is palpably disgusted with O’Banion, who amuses himself with casual cruelties, and signs point to him soon working under Al Capone, who is increasingly confident and happily violent, with flashes of humor (his behavior to Guzik is a nice callback to last season, because when Al Capone is your friend, he cares enough to throw away your hospital food). It’s almost worth Van Alden’s Chicago displacement just to get Michael Shannon and Stephen Graham in scenes together; their reactions to one another are flawless comedy, with a shot of unsettling dread as Van Alden watches Capone gun down the same driver O’Banion terrorized, and realizes just how firmly wedged he is between two violent masters.AdvertisementBut though this is serviceable forward motion, it pales in comparison to the quiet, loaded standoff of Nucky and Rothstein over a hand of cards. They’re both levelheaded strategists who try not to hold grudges, largely by outmaneuvering the people who might give them anything to resent; they’ve each had plenty to hold against one another. They both pride themselves on being forward-thinking, despite long-held habits they fall into repeatedly; they both know how to wield the withering remark like a pistol. And business is always personal, which makes Nucky’s change of heart on Tampa a move he had to know was dangerous. It’s an example of what this show does best that in a show rife with violence, some of the biggest fighting words of the last seasons are contained in a four-word exchange between them: “People change.” “Do they?”We’ll see.Stray observations: Okay, let’s talk. For all the things it’s great at doing, Boardwalk Empire has never been overly generous as regards its female characters. The few who make their way with any permanence into the cast are still apparently narratively expendable (Gillian plummeted from Lady-Macbeth antagonist to freelance junkie and occasional undercover wife, though there’s setup for her to rise from the ashes; we have no idea what Margaret can rise to, since she has yet to appear a third of the way through the season). It’s a shame; at her best-written, Margaret in particular was as complex, ambitious, and fallible as Nucky, and even when she wandered from the plot, her sphere often presented social constrictions the speakeasy world didn’t show us. (Last year’s hospital subplot was far from thrilling, but neatly illustrated how trapped Margaret felt in her ability to use her social power, and foreshadowed how her relationship with Nucky would finally fall apart past reconciliation.) But even for Boardwalk, this season has had a dearth of women who are actively involved in either the main storylines or even the side stories of their own. Gillian, one hopes, will come back swinging, but so far, aside from heroin injections, things have only happened to her.The three women in this episode who have speaking roles share a dozen lines of dialogue. One of them is a Chicago apartment-dweller who gives the Capones entry to a victim’s apartment. One of them is a petulant coed. But one of them is Daughter Maitland, and I give Margot Bingham full marks for taking her throwaway scene and imbuing it with as much depth as she does: Is she a pawn of Narcisse or ambitious for reasons of her own? There should be more here, and quickly. (Her voice also needs its due; her honeyed rendition of “Tain't Nobody's Bizness If I Do” only gets a few bars, but fingers crossed for a full performance.)Nucky Fooling Himself Of the Week, as he gives dropoff instructions to a dead-serious Kessler: “Don’t be so dramatic, it’s only money.”Frank Capone once again spends the episode proving he’s a great foil for his brother’s utter lack of suavity. I’m sure that won’t get awkward soon.Rothstein, who seems to be awfully prophetic about himself, reaches a five-minute fulfillment prophecy here, when he finally loses it at the poker table with a controlled but masterfully creepy fit at the dealer, who glanced at Lansky: “Don’t look at him. Don’t look at him. Look at me. I’m the player.”Show all 251 commentsContinue reading"

Rothstein reminisces about when they first met, with Rothstein saying Nucky was a type he'd recognized -- \"a small-town glad-hander, peering over the fence so he'd get to stick his finger in a new piece of pie.\"\"I don't like pie,\" Nucky says.Meyer Lansky, standing at Rothstein's shoulder, is getting annoyed with the guy, but Rothstein calmly tells Lansky that it's all part of the contest. Rothstein asks for $200,000 from the house and Nucky approves it. Rothstein immediately puts it all in. Nucky has a flush, queen high.\"I figured you for a straight,\" Rothstein says.\"Then you figured me wrong again,\" Nucky replies.Nucky says it's been good getting to know Rothstein again, and picks up his chips.Ralph and Eddie are still at the bar drinking, now with a group of other Germans. Eddie tells his German friends about his promotion. Eddie suddenly kicks the whole bar off in a song.Willie and his pal are waiting for a reaction from Henry. He runs to the bathroom, but Willie has locked it. Willie then calls out for Henry to show everyone the Charleston again. Suddenly, Henry explodes and everyone reacts. Willie says most people his age are out of diapers, and goes outside with Doris to get some air.Al asks Van Alden to take the wheel while he snorts some cocaine. He offers some to Van Alden, who declines. Al asks if O'Banion has been treating him right. Van Alden says O'Banion is a jokester and prankster who doesn't treat him with respect. Al suggests Van Alden could come work for him in Cicero. Theres a pounding on the back of the truck. They pull over and find that the guy O'Banion had played the shotgun prank on comes out. He says he \"didn't see nothing\" and won't say anything, but Al gives the guy a 10-second head start and hands a pistol to Van Alden, who isn't sure what Al wants him to do with it.\"It don't matter to me if O'Banion finds out about this,\" Al says.Van Alden shoots twice and his pistol jams. Suddenly, Al starts blasting dozens of rounds into the darkness with his tommy gun, laughing hysterically.Willie's friend wakes him in the middle of the night and there's a small crowd in the dorm building. Henry is dead, with blood splattered all around the bathroom. Someone says he heard Henry going to the bathroom all night.Rothstein is still losing and asks for a fresh deck of cards. Lansky suggests they go, but Rothstein refuses. The dealer starts a new deck but Rothstein doesn't like the feel of it. Rothstein is visibly frustrated and Lansky leans in and whispers, \"Wouldn't it be best people don't see you like this?\"Rothstein stands up and walks away.\"Thanks for the pocket change, Goldstein,\" the annoyed man at the table says.Rothstein walks back as aggressively as he's generally ever been, but stops short of the man, leans forward and calmly says, \"Rothstein.\" He walks away again.Lansky comes to Nucky, who is drinking alone at the bar, and asks Nucky not to extend Rothstein anymore credit just because he's in a bit of a rough patch. Nucky says he's taking the Tampa deal off the table. Nucky says he can't go into business with someone so obsessed with winning. Lansky asks Nucky if the terms of the deal would be the same for him, without Rothstein. Nucky asks Lansky what kind of man he is. Lansky tells a story of getting jumped by a gang of kids three days in a row for his lunch money. He got beat and they took his money twice. The third day, the leader asked him to join the gang. The leader was Lucky Luciano. That's how they became partners. Lansky says he and Lucky can watch the Tampa deal themselves. Nucky tells him he needs $500,000. Lansky says it's \"done.\" They shake on it.The Capones drive Van Alden home and make fun of the dumpy, pre-fab house he lives in. They tell him to stick with them and they'll get him into a house with indoor plumbing.Lansky is waiting outside for the guy who was talking to Rothstein during the poker game and beats him senseless.Nucky gets home and calls for Eddie while pouring himself a drink. Tom comes and asks if he needs something and Nucky says he's fine.Eddie sends Ralph off for his train back to Chicago and they're still laughing about the fun they've had and the German song Ralph couldn't learn. Ralph leaves and Agent Knox and a partner confront Eddie, taking him out of the train station while telling him not to make a scene.Contribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore from this titleMore to explorePhotosTop Stars to Watch in 2024See the galleryListThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2024See the listListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

Not only has Al been able to drive his naturally gregarious personality into something that at least resembles efficiency, but Meyer Lansky is also beginning to make good on his youthful promise. Anatol Yusef, who was great in the recent British drama Southcliffe, shines here as the natural heir to Rothstein. He’s always been cautious and thoughtful, at least by comparison to his friend and former bully Luciano, but now he’s beginning to outshine even Arnold. It’s Lansky who urges restraint at Arnold’s gambling (albeit not at his abusive fellow player), and who recognises the opportunity that Nucky offers. A lot of this episode’s camera work has been expansive (just look at the sweeping upward shot of the Capones discovering O’Banion’s van) but the best one of all was close, patient and intimate, as the camera swept around Lansky’s face as his whispers to Rothstein. The import is clear. Capone is loud and obvious while Lansky is smooth and quiet. He’s no less ruthless though, as the final beatdown shows. He’ll have to be. This is pleasure and it’s a serious business.\nRead Michael’s review of the previous episode, Acres Of Diamonds, here.\nFollow ourTwitter feed for faster news and bad jokes right here.
