Each episode made you laugh and cry. However, as expected by many, the very obvious scripting and rigging of the finale sent the weakest (though still talented) member of Team Boom to win. The scores for the battle section were ridiculous in range and they didn't focus at all on the stronger/better dancers. With so many highly talented international dancers with decades of experience; China still couldn't let one of them win. Because of this, though I watched the live the majority of it and woke up at 4:45am for it, I couldn't watch the last 2 hours. It just wasn't fair. And therefore, it doesn't get a solid 10 from me.

Anyways dance is a universal language. You don't need to know what they are saying because their dance speaks for them. I love the captains. A little biased towards Yibo but they all seem so fun. I am excited to see what Henry has stored for us. A lot of things seem different, probably because of the pandemicI'll update when subs are provided and tell if my opinion changed now that I will be able to understand what they are laughing at.Update after watching with Eng subs-Ok so this season looks very different, not only will participants be checked but also the team captains. For the rules of the match, they are referring to Chinese chess. If you don't know Xiangqi or Chinese chess, it's a game for two players, and \"unlike at western Chess, the pieces are placed on line intersections, not squares. Each player starts the game with these pieces: 1 king (or general), 2 guards (or advisors), 2 elephants (or bishops), 2 knights (or horses), 2 rooks (or chariots), 2 cannons, and 5 pawns (or soldiers).\" So basically all 4 captains were given necklaces that stand for king and the captains had to give the participants of their choice a necklace that either stood for rook, knight, cannon, bishop, or guard. Later they would have to decide which participants were suitable to send for rounds of battle, which included 1v1,2v2, 3v3, and 5v5. The captains will also lead the team members in a king battle.They also had simulated toy figures for all the contestants.Like Yibo mentioned the method for the battle was also very fair because for each section they were letting the captains pick from people who were at the same level or had the same capacity. Also adding the fact that they were picking from blind boxes. The captains also had the chance to \"lock\" one contestant of their choice to be in their team.I liked that in this season they gave each team a choreographer.Label Battle:First Half: Yibo vs Yixing and Henry vs Han Geng.Second Half: Yibo vs Han Geng and Yixing vs Henry.For this battle captains had to pick 10 contestants and split them into the 1st and 2nd half. A necklace will be given to them depending on what role suits them.2v2-They will wear bishop or pawn3v3- Rook, cannon, or knight5v5- pawnsPersonal thoughts on episode 1:I was very excited to see Yibo and Bouboo on the same team again.Bunta and Kun were so cute. My favorite choreographers.I was so sad to see Huang xiao and George were not on the same team.Ibuki was so cuteAc was adorable The captains are very well balanced (reminds me of Lay saying balance last season), they all have their charms, Han Geng is relaxed, Henry is playful, Lay is a mix of playful and relaxed and Yibo well yibo is yibo.All I got to say is this season the captains didn't come to play.Ep2:Henry really surprised me. At this point what can't henry do?Second Half:Lay: \"Keven is pretty good. But Keven's heart is not in me. Keven's heart must be with YiBo\" Nelson and Zyko wow just wow. They are really good dancers and Like Yan kai said it looked like Zyko's body ascended. It felt as if his body weight was nothing.I cried during the dance battle between Acky san and Nelson. Acky is a phenomenal dancer and you can feel his passion. For someone that is 47, he dances like he is in his 20's.Hilty &Bosch you can tell they have been dancing together for a long time. Their chemistry and synchronization are spectacular. I look forwards to seeing more of them.Omg, the little kids at the end. The little b-boy blew my mind and to think he is only 6 yet has so much talent.Favorite dancers for this episode: KenKen, Bo Zi, and Han YunNo no no I saw YiBo crying in the preview for the next episode :(I want to see more of Bunta, kun, and Huang Xiao.Ep3-Only 49 people can go to the next roundSo lay balanceJackson artand now henry compares them to musical instruments YiBo was probably planning to murder Lay for not voting for BouBoo. Poor YiBo was probably having a mental breakdownAC is adorable Xiao ming with his \"perish together\" music was hilarious. During that scene idk if I was laughing because of what he said or because Lays laugh was adorable.\"They were acting as a patient, but Jr. Taco is a patient himself\" When I tell you I cried while laughing during his performance..Colin's performance was really heartfelt. I agree with the judges, that kind of performance is hard to judge. When YiBo started crying I also broke down crying. It's not only dancers but I think this applies to all career-oriented people or people chasing after their dreams. Sometimes we are so focused on accomplishing our goals that we forget or don't have time to reply to our family members. Ep4I admire George for not giving up even tho he was injured. I was hoping to see more of Huang Xiao and George but oh well...sad that he left Henry: \"I am learning to play erhu recently\"Han Geng: \"Then I am going to play the zither\"Henry: \"About zither I...\"Yibo:\"I can do some magic\"Yixing: \"I can play drums, Chinese drums.It follows the beat\"Henry: \"I can also try it\"Han Geng: \"Actually, we are a band\"I love their bickering.Huang Xiao never fails to amaze me.Xiao Ji is hilarious since last season. He only called out because he had to use the restroom.Acky san always gives such a good performance Li Chunlin wow, his performance was awesome. Although the music wasn't his and the choreography was made right there and then it felt like he had practiced it already.I get so excited every time someone I like makes it.Xiao Jie is always so creative Glad to see Keven made itCypher- Henry: Popping Yixing: KrumpYiBo: HipHopHan Geng: PoppingAll 4 of the captains were amazing. I can't even pick a favoriteAHHHH George came back. Thank you yixingEp5-I liked how yang kai took his time to explain the song it did not only help the foreign dancers understand the story but it all brought them closer as a team. Their efforts really showed in their choreography. He is a phenomenal team leader.Jr. Taco and Xiao Jie are both hilariousBoth Nelson and Acky-san did great performances but I preferred NelsonsWang YiBo-\" I don't want to lose, I wan to win win win\"I am glad to see huang xiao and George on the same team again.Ep6-Huang Xiao and George can really understand each other very well in terms of dancing.As always Huang xiao gives an amazing performance, this time with KenKen.Ma Xiaolong is an amazing choreographer.Love Xiao Ji, he is hilariousWaiWai, Fan Fan, Boris, Tao tao, Cici, Eleven, Li Chunlin, and Bunta gave an amazing performance.Wang Yibo never fails to amaze me. He pays attention to each dance to the point he knows their style and can say who choreographed what part.Ep7- YiBo made the right decision in speaking with his team and asking them about their feelings and opinion.\"When we are together in a team, we have to learn from each other, talk to each other and communicate\"-YiBoHan Geng was so thoughtful with his gifts and YiBo's gift to Yang Kai's son was so sweet.Team BOOM(YiBo)-David, Liang Liang, Nelson, BouBoo, Hilty&Bosch, Jr. Taco, Momo Koyama, Yang Kai, ToozinTeam FKM(Han Geng)- AC, Ibuki, Zyko, Ma Xiaolong, Stone, Xiao Ji, Xiao Jie, Acky, eleven, Yu Wan, FanFan, Team Lit Dragon(Lay)- Poppin C, George, Huang Xiao, KenKen, BoZi, Bunta, Daswitch, Mt-pop, GoGo brothersTeam Tiger Warrior (Henry)- Han Yu, Chika, Rochka,Mr. Three, G-co, Boris, Li Chunlin, WaiWai, Cici, Tao Tao,c-LilSdc3Yibo: What YiBo wants YiBo getsSdc4 Yibo: What YiBo wants YiBo still gets Wow, we have some great singers among the dancers, especially Ma Xiaolong.Henry finally made his very own band with the dancers(as expected)YiBo's magic show. I need a front-row seat to see it.This episode was so fun, I was laughing from start to end.For episodes 8-12 you will have to watch it yourself to know what happens *wink* Read More Was this review helpful to you?
