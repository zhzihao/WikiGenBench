made by a US-based organisation fighting a subpoena from an American lobbyist who had been hired by Qatar - shows that the Middle East state transferred millions to FIFA committee members. The Qatar National Bank (QNB) sent these funds directly to the committee members – who were in charge of voting for the host nation for each football World Cup, which is held every four years.A report by US magazine Tablet, states that documents from QNB list names, bank account numbers, and exact amounts of money that were transferred. The magazine also reports that approximately $330 million went to 22 people between February of 2009 and December 2010. Voting to choose the World Cup hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was held on 2 December 2010.Qatar gained enough votes to beat a challenge from the United States to be the 2022 World Cup host. It gained 14 votes in the final round of voting, whereas the US only received eight as the host country for the 2022 competition. Tablet says the majority of the transferred money went to 14 FIFA members.StagesPayments to the FIFA members were made in two stages. Qatar sent a portion of the money before the voting was held. The remaining part of the funds was sent after Qatar and gained enough votes to win the vote to host the World Cup 2022. Many of those receiving these bribery payments did so using offshore banking accounts – a move that can reduce the potential for payments to be scrutinised.The documents that have been released indicate that the largest payments made by Qatari officials went to Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s former minister for sport. Mutko is alleged to have received payments totalling more than $100 million in combined payments. An initial $72.6 million transfer was made to him in 2009, followed by a $34 million transfer after the December 2010 voting to choose the World Cup 2022 host. The International Olympic Committee banned Mutko in 2017.BannedDespite Qatar denying allegations of impropriety in the voting to determine the hosts of the 2022 World Cup, a large number of FIFA executive committee members have been banned or indicted over allegations of corruption and wrongdoing. The ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter has himself admitted that “the choice of Qatar was a mistake”.This type of corruption is not new: former FIFA executive committee member Charles Blazer has acknowledged that he received bribes in connection with Morocco’s and South Africa’s bids for the 1998 and 2010 World Cups. Clearly a lot needs to be done to repair the reputational damage associated with the awarding of recent World Cups.Deep-rooted structural change to voting processes may not come easy to FIFA, which is a very large organisation whose executive committee (also known as FIFA Council) has 37 members. Perhaps a smaller executive committee would be a welcome start, with members being elected rather than appointed by their federations. What is clear is that more oversight would assist with the organisation’s accountability and be a large step towards restoring its severely tarnished reputation.\nRelated Expertise\nAnti Bribery and Corruption\n< Previous\nAnti-Corruption Due Diligence - An In-depth Guide\nNext >\nThe G7 Announce a New Anti-Corruption Task Force for Ukraine\nNext >\nShare this page on\nLondon Office Bridge House181 Queen Victoria StLondon.EC4V 4EG+44 (0)203 947 1539\nNorthern Office Roma House 59 Pellon Lane Halifax.

The government has imposed sweeping restrictions on journalists travelling to cover the World Cup, a move that human rights groups say will have a “severe chilling effect” on the media coverage of the event.\nDanyel Reiche, a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University Qatar, where he leads a research initiative on the political and economic legacy of the World Cup, believes it is much more complex than a case of sportswashing. He elucidates: “To think that a country like Qatar would invest big in a football tournament just to distract from some human rights violations — I don’t think this does justice to the complexity of the matter.\n“There are a variety of reasons why Qatar invests in sports, starting with being visible as a small state, gaining influence in international affairs, and contributing to national security.”\n© Hasan Zaidi |\nSustainaibility controversy\nFIFA had promised that the 2022 tournament would be the first carbon-neutral World Cup in the competition’s history, but researchers are not convinced. They argue that the tournament’s sustainability plan relies on some creative accounting.\n“This probably underestimates the emissions by about 1.4 megatonnes — or 1.4 million tons — and that’s quite a conservative estimate,” said Dufrasne, who recently authored a report on the problems with the tournament’s sustainability pledge.\n“Adding that to their existing estimate, their total footprint is closer to 5 megatonnes rather than the 3.6 megatonnes they have announced.” (As a point of reference, the entire country of Uruguay produced an estimated 4.7 megatonnes of carbon in 2019.)\nWill the Qatar World Cup boost its popularity?\nThe benefits of hosting the World Cup are clear for ascendant nations like Qatar. “Qatar is a small state, and for small states, the main objective in international affairs is visibility,” explains Danyel Reiche, a visiting associate professor at Georgetown University Qatar, where he leads a research initiative on the political and economic legacy of the World Cup. “Apart from visibility, it’s also about having some influence in international affairs and being able to punch above weight.”\nBut the increased international scrutiny that comes with this high-profile tournament also creates significant political liabilities for hosts. As Reiche and his co-author Paul Michael Brannagan argue in their new book on the tournament, “ Qatar intends to use the 2022 World Cup to promote a positive image of the country abroad, the tournament has, in contrast, come to introduce and educate many global audiences to the state in largely negative terms.”\nIn Qatar’s case, said Reiche, the benefits still appear to outweigh the drawbacks. But as global awareness of the tournament’s economic, ecological, and human costs continues to spread, FIFA and future host nations will have to answer difficult questions about the tournament’s merit.\nSource: The many, many controversies surrounding the 2022 World Cup, explained\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nEditor's Recommended Articles\nMust Read >>\nNew report reveals extent of exploitation in Qatar\nMust Read >>\nMisogyny towards women’s sports common amongst male fans\nMust Read >>\nThe consequences of a global pandemic on human rights defenders\nMust Read >>\nPM Johnson must stop arms export to Saudi Arabia says Human Rights Watch\nMust Read >>\nUK to stand for re-election to Human Rights Council\nTAGSEconomyHuman RightsPolitics\nFreya Thomson\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\nBritain has a plan to let aid through in Gaza\nSouth Africa accuses Israel of genocide in Gaza\nRockford associates: Providing a financial lifeline for councils in 2024 and beyond\nPublic sector trend predictions 2024: Addressing challenges and embracing innovation\nΔ\nRelated Academic Articles\nPursuing responsible finance in a world of risking risks\nJanuary 19, 2024\nUK childcare policy: Navigating choices, challenges and the need for reform\nJanuary 18, 2024\nEnhancing Japanese elementary and junior high-school foreign language education\nJanuary 17, 2024\nFollow Open Access Government\nGovernment Reports\nRedefining prosperity in east London through citizen science\nJanuary 11, 2024\nJuly 17, 2020\nAfter Covid-19: New ways of working in offices or at home\nApril 24, 2020\nRockford Associates: Research and profit from cash recovery\nApril 17, 2020\nGovernment eBooks\nDeliberative negotiation: Unearthing the path toward political collaboration\nQuick Launch eBook\nMore Details\nNovember 6, 2023\nFemale entrepreneurs: Do women run their businesses differently than men?\nQuick Launch eBook\nMore Details\nSeptember 13, 2023\nSwindon & Wiltshire Local Enterprise Partnership support matters\nQuick Launch eBook\nMore Details\nJanuary 27, 2023\nCore governance activities: Risk management and information governance\nQuick Launch eBook\nMore Details\nDecember 21, 2022\nPlease Choose\nSearch Everything\nArticles\neBooks\nPublications\nSpecial Reports\nStakeholders\nUseful ResourcesPublications\nStakeholders\neBooks\nSpecial Reports\nQuick LinksContact Us\nAbout Us\nOur Editors\nOur Audience\nPrestige Contributors\nTestimonials\nFeature Articles\nDigital infrastructure to connect all communities\nJanuary 19, 2024\nPrescribing solutions for the NHS staff shortage crisis\nJanuary 18, 2024\nShould the wider population be paying attention to their blood sugar...\nJanuary 17, 2024\nPlug making green hydrogen a reality in Europe and beyond\nJanuary 17, 2024\nLatest Publication\nOpen Access Government January 2024\nQuick Launch Publication\nMore Details\nJanuary 8, 2024\nLatest eBook\nKnee health promotion option: A comprehensive management for knee osteoarthritis\nQuick Launch eBook\nMore Details\nJanuary 17, 2024\nABOUT USOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide audience.
