The site backed on to a former burial ground (New Bunhill Fields) which restricted development so that no major improvement was possible after the 1897 reconstruction. Following a destructive fire in 1958, the hall itself was demolished. The pub façade in its late nineteenth century form survives, somewhat modified, but the rooms behind have been radically altered to form a bookshop and the space formerly occupied by the theatre itself is now a timber store, open at the rear. The side walls and some traces of escape staircases serve to identify it but (contrary to popular belief) there is nothing else left to be seen of the music hall. The façade carries a blue commemorative plaque. There has been some discussion of the possibility of building a new theatre on the site of the hall and this might very well be successful in the ‘Little Theatreland’ between Sadler’s Wells and Highbury Corner.\nBuilt / Converted1863Dates of use\n1863 - 1958\nCurrent stateFaçade onlyCurrent useConverted to other use (bookshop in front of building/timber yard at rear) Address10-11 Islington Green, London, Islington, N1, England\nWebsite-\nFurther details\nOther names\nRed Lion\n,\nLansdown Arms\n,\nLansdown Arms Music Hall\n,\nSam Collins' Music Hall\n,\nCollins' Theatre of Varieties\n,\nbriefly & World War I: Islington Hippodrome\nEvents\nOwner/Management:\n1862 Design/Construction:\nUnknown\n- Architect\n1863 - 1958 Use:\n1881 - 1897 Owner/Management: Herbert Sprake\n1885 Alteration: adjoining house taken to provide new entrance and hall largely rebuilt\nEdward Clarke\n- Architect\n1897 Alteration: new auditorium and other improvements\nE A E Woodrow\n- Architect\n1898 Alteration: electric light installed\nUnknown\n- Architect\n1908 Alteration: repaired and altered after fire; six circle boxes removed\nUnknown\n- Architect\n1911 Alteration: balcony reseated and other renovation works\nLovegrove & Papworth\n- Architect\n1931 Alteration: Bowler & Clay, new heating and ventilation installed\nWingfield\n- Architect\nCapacities\nCapacity\nOriginal\nCapacity\nLater\nDescription\n1897: 1800\nlater: 1444\nListings\nListing\nNot listed\nStage type-\nBuilding dimensions: -Stage dimensions: -Proscenium width: -Height to grid: -Inside proscenium: -Orchestra pit: -\nFooter menu 1\nShow — Footer menu 1\nHide — Footer menu 1\nSign up to our mailing list\nLondon Room Hire\nFooter menu 2\nShow — Footer menu 2\nHide — Footer menu 2\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nSitemap\nImages on our site\nFacebook\nTwitter\n© 2017 Theatres Trust.

(Nineteenth-century practice was to use the singular,woman's, when referring to women as a class; later practice was to use the plural,women's.) The twenty-ninth annual convention of theNew York State Woman Suffrage Association (NYSWSA)was organized byElizabeth Smith Millerand her daughter, Anne Fitzhugh Miller;Susan B. Anthonywas one of the principal speakers.Isabel Howland, of the prominentabolitionistHowland family ofSherwood, served as Treasurer of the Convention.\nSessions open to the public were held at Collins Hall and theSmith Opera House, use of which was donated to the conference by its owner, the pro-suffrage Geneva entrepreneur and philanthropistWilliam Smith. Business meetings were held in downtown Geneva at theHotel Nester.\nCollins Hall was the site of the convention's opening session on the evening of Wednesday, November 3.\nThe Building and the Site.TheRichardsonian Romanesquestructure was completed in 1893, built by Captain and Mrs. Louis Dell Collins. (Mrs. Collins had theBelhurst Castle, a landmark just south of Geneva, constructed in the same style some seven years earlier; that property is now a resort.) The Music Hall operated until 1908, when theBenevolent and Protective Order of Elkspurchased it. Lodge #1054 operated for many years. Most recently, the property has been restored and made into private apartments.\nWhen Collins Hall first opened, its street address was 460 South Main. But the city of Geneva standardized its street numbering scheme shortly thereafter, causing the east side of South Main Street to receive odd street numbers, so the address was changed to 459 South Main.\nJust south of the property is a terraced, grassy hill; this is the former site of East Washington Street, which was razed during the urban renewal of central Geneva circa 1966. The rear of the property now overlooks Geneva’s successfully redeveloped lakefront.\nCollins Hall\nContemporary image of the former Collins Hall/Elks Lodge #1054, now a private apartment building.\nSeneca Lake can be glimpsed behind the gray sedan at right. The open strip through which it is seen marks the former route of East Washington Street, removed during the urban renewal of the 1960s.\nElks lintel\nThis carved lintel memorializes Elks Lodge #1054, now defunct, which took over the short-lived music hall in 1908.\nSouth Main streetscape\nThe Richardsonian Romanesque structure caps a picturesque line of row houses. The neighborhood, one of the oldest in Geneva, boasts numerous such row houses in a federally recognized historic district.\nHill corridor\nThis view looks east alongside the former Collins Hall. The grassy strip was, until the 1960s, a street that ran downhill toward the Geneva lakefront.\nPeriod image\nPeriod image of the structure, festooned with patriotic bunting.\nGeneva convention poster\nPoster promoting the November 1897 statewide conference of the New York State Woman Suffrage Association (NYSWSA) held at Geneva with Susan B.

The foyer area was to be multi-layered, with a glazed roof and west wall to entice patrons along the dark passage.
