Image location and sources (clockwise from top-left): Snow across Saguaro forest in desert mountain in North Scottsdale, AZ at approximately 3000 ft. elevation (credit: Mason Meiners); Snow at Fire Station 616 in North Scottsdale, AZ at approximately 3000 ft. elevation (credit: Scottsdale Fire Department); Snow in Gold Canyon at approximately 1800 ft. elevation (credit:Craig Codiga); Snow at Queen Valley, AZ at approximately 1900 ft. elevation (credit: @Chris19670756 on twitter)\nWhy were snow levels, even in early March, so low across the area? The biggest factor was the very cold air mass this storm system brought. According to the North American Ensemble Forecast System (NAEFS),temperatures in the mid to lower-levels of the atmosphere (500-850 hPa layer), were anomalously cold with values near record minimum (Fig. 13). As a result, the air mass was cold enough for snow to fall at low elevations.\nFollow us on Twitter\nFollow us on Facebook\nFollow us on YouTube\nPSR RSS Feed\nUS Dept of Commerce\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nNational Weather Service\nNWS PhoenixPAB 1TA, C/O SRP1600 N Priest Dr.Tempe, AZ 85288(602) 275-0073Comments?

This event dropped 1″ of precipitation. Total snowpack accumulation so far this season is approximately 2.5′ at Swamp Angel and above treeline at Senator Beck is 1′. A decent start to the snow season with accumulation being near average.The next storm looks to arrive Sunday night and projected to be widespread over the Western Slope with bits of the moisture hitting Northeast Colorado. The longer term forecast is calling for the active weather pattern to continue.Take Care\nWY2023_Storm_Report #5\nStorm Report #4, November 28-29, 2022: Another 0.5″ Precipitation\nStorm#4_WY23\nStorm Report #3, November 2-4, 2022: Another Multiday Storm, 1.7″ Precipitation\nStorm#3_WY23\nStorm Report #2, October 26-27, 2022: Little Storm Over 30 Hours\nA nice follow-up storm here kept snow on the ground and temperatures cool for the end of October. Swamp Angel received 14 mm of precipitation over 30 hours, about 16.6 cm of snow accumulation on the ground. Red Mountain SNOTEL SWE increased to 1.5 inches.\nStorm#2_WY23\nStorm Report #1, October 22-24, 2022: Snow Accumulation Begins for WY2023\nWinter kicked off here with a cold Pacific storm bringing about 25 centimeters of snow accumulation at Swamp Angel. On October 24th at the end of the day, Red Mountain SNOTEL Station reported 140% of normal precipitation with about an inch of SWE.\nThe storm lasted a day and half, bringing regional, widespread precipitation over the mountains. Utah received the deepest snowfall total of the storm with an exciting 27 inches of snow accumulating at Snowbird in the Wasatch Mountains.\nIt is projected to be a La Nina year, with about 70% probability of La Niña conditions persisting through February and a 55% chance of La Niña through March (WWA). It’s worth noting all major Upper Colorado River Basin reservoirs are also below average capacity, and drought conditions persist in most parts of the region except central Colorado this month.\nStorm#1_WY23\nDonate to CSAS\nDonate to CSAS through Colorado Gives\nNo categories\n© 2024 Center for Snow and Avalanche Studies"
