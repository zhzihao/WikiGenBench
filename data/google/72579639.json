Simultaneously, the mullahs are doing their best to quash the protests by issuing death sentences for the arrested protesters.The Iranian Judiciary issued death sentences for five protesters on December 7 and sentenced another 11, including three 17-year-olds, to heavy prison sentences. The mullahs’ Judiciary has not officially announced the names of those who received death sentences.The sixteen defendants are accused of the alleged killing of a member of the paramilitary Bassij force, Ruhollah Ajamian, in the protests during the 40-day memorial of Hadis Najafi in Karaj on November 3.Ajamian had killed two protesters, Nima Nouri and Mehran Shekari, on the same day.The Judiciary’s spokesman, Massoud Setayeshi, declared that the verdicts were a preventive measure meant to teach a lesson to the protesters.The head of the mullahs’ Judiciary, Mohseni Ejei, announced on Monday, December 5, that the death sentences for some of the protesters had been upheld and would be carried out soon.Dr. Hamid and Farzaneh Ghareh Hassanlou with their childrenA couple, a doctor and a lab technician convictedDr. Hamid Ghareh Hassanlou, 53, a radiologist, was among the five sentenced to death. His wife, Farzaneh Ghareh Hassanlou, a lab technician, was sentenced to 25 years in a remote location, Ahvaz, without having any contact with anyone.The couple did not have access to their lawyer. The lawyer appointed by the government did not defend them. Instead, he denied that Hamid had been tortured and told him to accept the charges and finish the case.Interrogators broke four ribs of Dr. Hamid Ghareh Hassanlou under torture such that his lung was pierced. Hamid Ghareh Hassanlou had undergone surgery right before the trial.Some social media reports indicate that he was informed of his verdict in the hospital. Others suggest he was taken to court in a hospital gown to attend the trial. He took off his clothes to show the presiding judge the scars of torture to extract false confessions.The couple was arrested at home at 2 a.m. on November 4 before the eyes of their 10-year-old daughter. They also have a 20-year-old son.Dr. Ghareh Hassanlou and his wife, Farzaneh, have a good reputation as a charitable family, helping the impoverished and child laborers. They also helped construct schools in southern Iran.Left, Hamid Ghareh Hassanlou shows scars of torture, right, Farzaneh stands before the judgeNationwide protests and strikes, a massive night rally in Tehran mark Day 83Day 83 of the Iran uprising was marked by a massive nightly rally of thousands of the people of Tehran towards Azadi (Freedom) Square. It was the climax of a three-day action on Student Day, December 7.Iranian students held protests, sit-ins, and strikes in dozens of universities across Iran despite extensive repressive government measures.Security forces arrested a number of student protesters in some universities, including Tehran University, Khajeh Nassir University in Tehran, and Ferdowsi University in Mashhad.Members of Bassij and university security forces clashed with student protesters at Tehran University, Amir Kabir University in Tehran, and Ferdowsi University in Mashhad. They attacked the student protesters with batons and sticks and injured some.Demonstrations in three universities – from left, Amir Kabir University, Allameh Tabatabai University, and Ferdowsi University of MashhadThe bazaars (markets) in Tehran and all major cities across the country went on strike for the third consecutive day in solid support of the Iran uprising.University students and ordinary people held demonstrations in various districts of Tehran and dozens of cities and clashed with security forces.The clerical regime had deployed tens of thousands of IRGC guards, Bassij members, and plainclothes agents to contain and quash the protests.Such widespread and massive participation of Iranian people in rallies and protests despite massive repression and brutality of the state forces indicates the determination of Iranian women and men for regime change and toppling the mullahs.The NCRI Women’s Committee calls on international human rights agencies, including the UN Human Rights Council and the Special Rapporteur on Iran, to take urgent measures to stop the unfair, illegal proceedings against peaceful protesters, including women, in Iran.All detained protesters must be freed, and all charges against them dropped.Tags: PrisonersProtests ShareTweetPin4Share Related Posts Reserve Teachers Rally for Fair Treatment and Job Security in Tehran January 17, 2024 Amidst escalating economic hardships, reserve teachers in Tehran took to the streets to voice their grievances, demanding equitable treatment and improved working conditions, on January 17, 2024.

On the first day she would have remained firm, Hamid's brother recounted, but on the second day the judicial officers told her that they knew her son was in the Tabriz University dormitory, and if she did not confess by tonight that Hamid had beaten the victim\nAccording to a call for their release published by Change.org, \"the City prosecutor's office has refused to allow the accused individuals to retain their own lawyers, using 'national security' as a pretense.\" The call added that Dr. Ghare-Hassanlou had been discriminated against by prosecutors for his \"affiliations with Sufism.\"\nDuring the second session of the court hearing, on December 1 (the Persian date is Azar 10), Dr. Ghare-Hassanlou pleaded innocent. He said that he accepted the accusation that he had been \"negligent\" medically regarding Ajamian, but stated that he had not carried out \"the criminal act that resulted in the death of Shahid\nIranian media reported the news of his death sentence on December 12 (Azar 21). It is worth noting that, according to the records available online of the second session of the hearing, a court-appointed lawyer was present.

After the events of that day, Ghare-Hassanlou faces a death sentence — handed down amid a spate of harsh rulings that human rights advocates say have been dispensed without due process, in an apparent effort to quell the country’s ongoing protest movement.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe couple was part of a group departing a Nov. 3 ceremony to honor Hadis Najafi, a young woman who was killed in September during an anti-government protest. Ghare-Hassanlou and his wife exited their car to see why traffic had stopped and entered a scene of chaos.AdvertisementVideos taken at the scene, aired by state media outlets and shared widely on social media, showed protesters brutally beating a member of the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary force connected to the Revolutionary Guard, in the road, hitting, kicking and dragging him as he lies motionless. In one video, Ghare-Hassanlou’s wife appears to be trying to restrain the mob.“Farzaneh tried to stop them but she was not successful,” said Hooman Hosseini Nik, a radiologist who completed his residency with Hamid in Iran and now lives in Canada.That night security forces raided the couple’s home and arrested them, beating them in front of their 14-year-old daughter, said Behrad Sadoughian, a former classmate of Ghare-Hassanlou in Iran who now lives in Canada and has been following the case closely. A member of the security forces grabbed Ghare-Hassanlou, a radiologist known for his charitable work, by the hair, putting a knife to his throat and demanding to know where the couple kept weapons, Sadoughian says. He heard accounts of the night from those close to Ghare-Hassanlou.AdvertisementFriends and family members, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety, argue that there is no evidence to indicate that the couple participated in the violence against the Basij member, Ruhollah Ajamian. In addition, family members who said they spoke to the couple before their arrest recall them saying they came to the aid of a cleric who had been severely beaten nearby.In a video posted online by the state-backed Fars news agency, the cleric, identified by local media as Yasser Esmaili, describes how two people helped him at the time he was assaulted. In particular, he notes that a woman wearing an improper hijab stood near him and prevented the mob from attacking him again. Family members say this matches what Farzaneh Ghare-Hassanlou told them.Iran publicly executes protester tied to anti-government uprisingOn Dec. 5, Ghare-Hassanlou was sentenced to death and his wife was handed 25 years for her alleged role in the death of Ajamian, the Basij member. Family members, friends and human rights groups say the couple did not have adequate legal representation.AdvertisementAt least 15 people faced charges in Ajamian’s death; five of them, including Ghare-Hassanlou, received death sentences.Share this articleShareAt least 11 people, according to the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran, have been sentenced to death in connection with the protest movement, which began in September following the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, after she was detained for allegedly violating the country’s conservative dress code for women. More than 500 people have been killed and some 18,000 arrested amid the protests, according to the HRANA activist news agency. Accurate figures are difficult to ascertain.“The way the authorities are using the death penalty in this case is to instill fear in the public,” said Nassim Papayianni, an Iran campaigner at Amnesty International. “To send a message that regardless of who you are and what your story or background is we can arrest you in connection to these protests and we can quickly do sham expedited proceedings to sentence you to death.”Iran’s doctors have joined the uprising — and are paying the priceObservers, friends and family members say that even though neither Ghare-Hassanlou participated in the killing, the judiciary is using the case as a means of discouraging doctors and other professionals from taking part in the protest movement. Doctors treating protesters have been targeted by police, the British Medical Journal reported.AdvertisementThis month, the government has executed two protesters, both of them 23-year-old men, for allegedly attacking security forces. Observers say the judicial process that led to their execution was rushed and inadequate. One of the men, Majid Reza Rahnavard, was hanged from a crane with a bag over his head and his hands bound behind his back, 23 days after his arrest.When first in custody, the Ghare-Hassanlous were permitted outside contact. Word has gotten out about their condition: Both have been tortured, family members and friends allege.“His ribs were broken during interrogations,” said Hassan Ghare-Hassanlou, Hamid’s brother who lives in the Netherlands, who is in touch with others close to Hamid. “One of the ribs led to the bleeding in his left lung.” A statement from Amnesty International said that sources close to Hamid reported he had received three surgeries to address the internal bleeding.AdvertisementHe is being held in a hospital, family members say. A photo of him in the hospital obtained by The Washington Post shows bruises on his left leg and the left side of his body. On the day scheduled for Ghare-Hassanlou’s first court appearance, his doctor recommended that he join the court via video link because his health was not stable, according to friends and family members. Security agents took him to go to court anyway.Why mass strikes could be a missing key to Iran’s uprisingGhare-Hassanlou’s wife, Farzaneh, was beaten on the head with a baton and both her teenage daughter and an older son were threatened with violence unless she confessed against her husband. She agreed to say her husband had kicked the militia member once but wrote a letter the following day rejecting the confession, which she said was obtained under torture and duress. She also rejected the confession in court, family members, friends and human rights groups say.Many have rallied to support the couple. One online petition to free them has accrued more than 150,000 signatures. Molavi Abdol Hamid, a prominent Sunni cleric in the city of Zahedan who has become one of the government’s most outspoken critics since the protests began, spoke out about the case at Friday prayers last week.Advertisement“This doctor is a philanthropist and has worked for many people,” he said. “Everyone’s request is that you free Dr. Hamid Ghare-Hassanlou and his family.”Ghare-Hassanlou is known in Iran for charitable fundraising and for helping organize the construction of rural schools. In a video posted online last week, a group of girls who are students at one such school asks for him to be freed.“The judiciary is moving very fast on these issues,” said Ghare-Hassanlou’s brother Hassan. “In the case of the two people who were recently executed it was only about a month for their trial and execution. International pressure can take away this speed.”Share CommentsLoading...TOP STORIESWorld newsEssential reporting from around the worldThe Crown broke a promise to First Nations.
