Half of this figure would come from the estimated value of the Women’s World Cup in bundled deals, such as the arrangement with Fox in the US, and half would come from new deals in markets not covered by a multi-year agreement.\nHowever, Fifa was reportedly only able to generate another US$50 million as broadcasters who had previously received the rights to the tournament at little cost were not keen on meeting Fifa’s loftier valuations – especially given the time difference between hosts Australia and New Zealand and key markets like Western Europe.\nFifa president Gianni Infantino attempted to use public pressure to extract more lucrative offers, accusing broadcasters of undervaluing the rights and threatening a blackout. Meanwhile, government ministers in the countries affected urged for an end to the impasse.\nDeals were eventually reached in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK for the whole tournament, while a deal in Japan with public broadcaster NHK was only agreed a week before the first match was due to kick off.\n“Fifa is confident the 2023 Fifa Women’s World Cup will continue the upward growth from 2019 and continue to set viewership records around the world,” a Fifa spokesperson told the WSJ.\nSportsPro says…\nWomen’s soccer has never been more popular as it is now. It’s understandable why Fifa believes broadcasters who benefit from the Women’s World Cup’s ability to attract big ratings and moments of national importance should pay for the privilege. After all, for the game to grow, it needs commercial revenue.\nBut it’s also not hard to see why broadcasters might find it difficult to value a property that has previously been treated as a ‘value added extra’ in many negotiations. A more sensible approach would have been to adopt a long-term view for this tournament and use the unparalleled reach of public service broadcasting to grow audiences even further and make it easier to justify demands for more money in the future.\nThankfully, a blackout that would have been truly disastrous in terms of exposure has been avoided. However, Fifa’s brinkmanship has not only failed to deliver the reported revenue increase it hoped for, but also wasted months of valuable time that the broadcasters could have used to promote the tournament.\n1 / 2news articles read\nRegister\nAlready have an account?
