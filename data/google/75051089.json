McAdoo acts like he's discovered the secret recipe for success and it's just mindless and meaningless rhetoric. It's almost as dumb and inane as the \"1% gains\" garbage.You saw it in 2016 Go Terps : 10/2/2017 12:37 pm : link Everyone was bitching about the play calling, but not realizing that McAdoo was doing his best to use conservative offense and a good punt team to set up the strong defense in advantageous positions.\n1. The offensive line is a disaster\n2. The punting game has been poor in crucial spots\n3. The defense can not generate a conventional pass rush\nBut the concept of playing complementary football is sound, and something that McAdoo should continue to strive towards.McAdoo reality mdc1 : 10/2/2017 12:37 pm : link Do not get wrapped around the axle on this stuff. What was a while back is a reality that he had no experience as a HC, or OC, beyond the crash course with TC. Guess we are seeing it now. Bad football out there in all phases. So you could say complimentary bad football, everyone sucks as a team.There was a highlight Matt in SGS : 10/2/2017 12:44 pm : link that I used for an older game review, the 1990 Giants @ Rams game. Basically, the Giants slowly but surely took control of the game vs. the Rams just as they started coming back. The Giants went on a long, deliberate drive, wearing them down. The defense then forced a punt, which set up a field position game as Landeta pinned the Rams deep. The next play Everett threw an INT and the Giants went down and scored again. Game over. Pat Summerall simply said \"they just sort of choke you, don't they.\"\nThat is the 2017 Giants so far in a nut shell. Bad plays. Dumb plays. No competence from one unit to the other, but rather screw ups in all phases which lose games. And when you have bad complimentary football, you can usually look at the coach in playing his part in it. When Gallman got 7 yards and McAdoo immediately went back to throw again I was beyond frustrated with this shit. And you have bad play calling, followed by a shit punt, and then the defense not holding.\nit's not a new term, it's been around the NFL a while and teams like the Patriots have been using it for years.\nThat isn't \"complementary football\", that is just FOOTBALL! McAdoo acts like he's discovered the secret recipe for success and it's just mindless and meaningless rhetoric. It's almost as dumb and inane as the \"1% gains\" garbage.\nas well as doing the little things correctly, playing with awareness (which they're rather poor at this season, so far), limiting the mental, physical, and technique errors, playing above the X's and O's ... etc.\nWe seem to do every in screwy fashion from set up to execution.While the concept may be laudatory, . . . . TC : 10/2/2017 1:27 pm : link the result has been less enjoyable. More often it looks more like Benny Mac's desire to play with every toy he's been given than to craft winning game management. I.e., not necessarily going with what's working. This doesn't change until forced to abandon it by desperation. It's almost as if the game plan and his prior evaluation of players trumps what's happening.\nI've sometimes even wondered to what degree he's the ultimate decision maker. He may well be out of his depth.run idiotsavant : 10/2/2017 1:32 pm : link\nthen\nstop the runMeh blueblood'11 : 10/2/2017 1:43 pm : link This is just so utterly depressingGreat post Matt TC would have done a better job Bluesbreaker : 10/2/2017 1:43 pm : link There was a highlight\nMatt in SGS : 12:44 pm : link : reply\nthat I used for an older game review, the 1990 Giants @ Rams game.

While my selection of statistics is subjective, I hope it provides an objective measure to show how good or bad Iowa is doing, or has done, on their own terms. I’ve weighted the following components as such.\n50% - Winning / Win percentage: I’m not a monster. If Iowa wins the game, enough was done on offense to justify the result. Week to week, this could result in some pretty wild variance but in aggregate it does the job.\n33% - equal parts turnovers, time of possession, and offensive touchdowns: This is largely through the lens of “is Iowa’s offense helping the defense?” By limiting turnovers & holding onto the ball, it presumably keeps Iowa out of precarious positions in terms of field position and depth. Offensive touchdowns is shown as a way of answering whether Iowa’s offense takes advantage of opportunities given to them. Ideally, I would do red zone touchdown percentage but there were data integrity issues there which don’t exist with the simple “offensive touchdowns” metric. Plus, it seems silly to count a TD at the 20 yard line but not at the 21.\n17% - equal parts third down conversion percentage, yards/carry, completion percentage, & QB sacks: Three of these four were outlined in a post ahead of the season by Scott Dochterman. His fourth, red zone TD percentage, is explained above. I’ve added QB sacks as it is a way to estimate offensive line ability. Ultimately, I believe these four are the most stylistic of the eight I’ve identified so they’re weighted the lowest. By the way, smarter people than I say that third downs are bad - which is true! - but for a team like Iowa built on sustained drives, an ability to convert on third down is paramount.\nSome additional notes on the data: all of it is pulled from teamrankings.com, an elite website. The way the stats are compiled are simple win percentage and then the percentiles for each of the other ones vs. all NCAA FBS teams. Data is done for games between just FBS opponents so next week’s will be an estimation followed by data developed\nMore From\nBlack Heart Gold Pants\nHawks overcome slow start to notch Fran McCaffery’s 272nd win at Iowa\nHawks in the NFL - Wild Card Round\nIowa Hoops: Minnesota Stats & How to Watch\nMonday Musings: The Headband and the GOAT\nKittle, LaPorta Named to All-Pro Teams\n5 storylines as Iowa men’s basketball passes the halfway mark\nMost Read\nHawks overcome slow start to notch Fran McCaffery’s 272nd win at Iowa\nJosh Dix and Ben Krikke had big second halves for the Hawkeyes\nMonday Musings: The Headband and the GOAT\nIt’s Monday and I’m still in awe of the Headband and the GOAT\nHawks in the NFL - Wild Card Round\nDesmond King, Sam LaPorta, and Lukas Van Ness had a hand in victories for their teams\n5 storylines as Iowa men’s basketball passes the halfway mark\nThe Hawkeyes are firmly not on the bubble but plenty of opportunity to work their way there\nChorus\nFanPosts\nFanShots\nMasthead\nCommunity Guidelines\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nHorizontal - White\nContact\nHave a News Tip?\nBrowse Blogs\nSB Nation Masthead\nCompany Blog\nBlog Openings\nEditorial Ethics and Guidelines\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Notice\nCookie Policy\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Info\nLicensing FAQ\nAccessibility\nPlatform Status\nAdvertise with us\nJobs @ Vox Media\nShare this story\nTwitter\nFacebook"
