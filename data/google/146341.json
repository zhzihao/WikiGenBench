The first period, a two day strike, began at 18:00 (6pm) on Wednesday 13th November and ended at 18:00 on Friday 15th November. Unless some reconciliation could be brokered, the following periods of strike were planned to follow it:\n09:00 Friday 22nd November to 09:00 Saturday 30th November\n09:00 Wednesday 4th December to 09:00 Thursday 12th December\n09:00 Monday 16th December to 09:00 Tuesday 24th December\nThe armed forces have been providing emergency cover during the strike, using the vintage Green Goddess engines as part of Operation Fresco. As there are a limited number of military hydraulic cutting teams available, it is likely that emergency amputations may be necessary to free road accident victims from crashes.\nInevitably, as everybody involved admits, this cover won't really be sufficient, and the strike will put lives at risk. Each side places the responsibility entirely with the other; the FBU say that their employer's failure to meet their demands is the cause of the strike. Many fear that lives will be lost in fires because of a lack of a prompt response by emergency services.\nPublic support\nMany, including the firefighters themselves, believe that the British public are largely behind the firefighters, and see the government as intransigent and prepared to squander billions on supporting US war efforts whilst underpaying brave public servants. For example, the FBU branch secretary at Sale, Cheshire fire station says that the strike has received a \"tremendous amount of support from the public... (http://uk.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=46764&group=webcast)\nMany British trade unions, such as the RMT, have expressed solidarity, particularly at the rally on September 2.\nWhilst public respect for firefighters has generally been high, some members of the public resent what they perceive to be an attempt by the firefighters to abuse their position for financial gain, and regard their willingness to put lives at risk as a form of extortion. This view is expressed by many of the right wing newspapers and tabloids, particularly The Sun and the Daily Mail.\nCriticisms of the firefighters' claims\nA central plank of the firefighters' claim is that they put their lives at risk. However, a study in the Lancet found firefighting to be only the 23rd most dangerous occupation after common occupations such as refuse collectors, builders, lorry drivers, and farm workers. This study was based on official figures, although quite old ones, dating from 1979-1980 and 1982-83.\nCritics also say that the claim that their wage is not fair is also damaged by the reported fact that advertised posts for firefighters can receive 40 applications, indicating by the laws of supply and demand that the pay is more than sufficient. However, in response to this last point, the FBU has said that only 1 in 25 of those applicants are suitable for the post.\nRetrieved from \"https://academickids.com:443/encyclopedia/index.php/UK_Firefighter_dispute_2002/2003\"\nCategories: 2002 | 2003 | History of the United Kingdom | Labor disputes\nNavigation\nSearch\nToolbox\nPersonal tools\nThis page has been accessed 3655 times.

Fire and Rescue Services Under the Early New Labour Administrations from 1997 to 2005ChapterJan 2018 Peter Murphy Kirsten GreenhalghThis chapter recounts one of the most interesting but surprisingly confusing stories of the labour governments’ period from 1997 to 2005. The governments’ initial ‘modernisation’ agenda was generally welcomed by other public services. However, much needed and acknowledged, modernisation of the fire services was slower to materialise and in this early period firmly resisted. Although the fire service eventually was to become positively and proactively engaged in the service improvement agenda, this chapter focusses on the complex and fascinating earlier period of 1997–2005. This was dominated by the transfer of policy responsibility away from the Home Office and by the second national strike and resulting problems with reform of industrial relations. This ran alongside the modernisation reforms in governance, performance management and service delivery.ViewShow abstractPerformance management in fire and rescue servicesArticleFull-text availableMay 2013 Peter Murphy Kirsten GreenhalghThis article contributes to the strategic review of the 46 fire and rescue services in England and Wales. It examines the previous performance management regime and presents the authors' proposals for a new, more efficient and effective regime. Although targeted at England and Wales, the article will have relevance to other services and to fire services internationally.ViewShow abstractFirefighters' Experience of Strike: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis Case StudyArticleNov 2012Viv Brunsden Rowena HillThe processes involved in, and arising from, strike action have received little attention from academic psychologists. In 2004, the UK Fire and Rescue Service was affected by a national strike, for only the second time in It's history. Data from a case study of a single firefighter involved in this strike were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; Smith, 1996). Data was collected after the end of the strike, allowing both a retrospective reflection and a consideration of current impact. Three superordinate themes emerged: self identity, betrayal, and continuing effects. Themes were interwoven with a transitional sense of self affected by a growing sense of betrayal, with this continuing into the present. Findings suggest that strikes present an unfamiliar and unusual circumstance which facilitates a complex set of social interactions and relationships, both positive and negative. The environment ofthe strike enables a unique opportunity for personal reflection, which may have profound impact on constructions of the self. A plea is made for other psychologists to research strikes from the perspectives of those involved, rather than solely from an organisational perspective aimed at conflict resolution.ViewShow abstractEquality and Diversity in the Public Services: Moving Forward on Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual EqualityArticleJul 2009 Fiona Colgan Tessa WrightChris Creegan Aidan MckearneyA key change for lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people in the European Union has been the prohibition by the Employment Equality Directive (2000) of discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation. This article focuses on the UK, which in 2003 introduced legislation making it unlawful to discriminate on these grounds. It explores the factors encouraging ‘good practice’ in sexual orientation equality work. It considers progress within the public services that have ‘pioneered’ sexual orientation equalities work, drawing on the views of LGB employees, management and trade union stakeholders. The recent legislation is considered to have provided a major impetus for change; however, an emerging ‘business case’ within the public service modernisation agenda is considered to have provided both opportunities and barriers to progress. A challenge for HR practitioners is getting organisational commitment to sexual orientation work, which is still perceived within organisations as a ‘sensitive’ area.ViewShow abstractDispute Resolution and the Modernization of the Public Services in Britain: The Case of the Local Government Pay CommissionArticleSep 2008 Ian KesslerLinda DickensThis article focuses on an ad hoc body, the UK Local Government Pay Commission, as a means of developing a broader argument on the relationship between collective dispute resolution and the nature of public service reform. It suggests that the character of disputes in this sector and the `fitness for purpose' of those institutions designed to resolve them are critically related to an industrial relations agenda, which is in turn shaped by changing forms of public service provision. An extended period of public service `modernization' in local government led to a restructuring of collective bargaining with substantive and procedural consequences: new issues emerged and related tensions arose that could not be managed by the traditional bargaining machinery or by the use of existing third-party conciliation or arbitration mechanisms. It required relatively novel arrangements in the form of the LGPC whose nature and operation and lessons are discussed.ViewShow abstractShaping the Bargaining Agenda. The Audit Commission and Public Service Reform in British Local GovernmentArticleSep 2007 Ian Roper Paul HigginsJamesThis article examines the role of the Audit Commission (AC) in local\ngovernment collective bargaining. While the AC has no official role in such bargaining,\nit has a role in monitoring the performance of local government services. In this role the\nAC has a clear potential, in the context of the government’s ‘modernization’ agenda – as\nmanifested in its ‘Best Value’ regime, for influencing both the content of collective\nagreements, and the process of collective bargaining, where these are seen to conflict with other Best Value objectives – particularly in relation to external competition. The research conducted involved a content analysis of AC inspection reports on human resource services and longitudinal case studies of two local authority union branches’ experiences of Best Value and the role of the AC. The findings from the inspection reports indicate that, while the AC is actually acting to promote activities that could be seen as supportive of union bargaining agendas, notably in relation to equality type issues, they are also supporting service externalisation and thereby acting to limit the scope of their impact. The reports also indicate that, despite there being prescribed ‘best practice’ for local government employment relations (‘social partnership’ with unions), the AC is not\npromoting any such engagement with unions. Evidence from the case studies add weight to these observations: the AC, in one case, was deeply suspicious of an attempted union\nmanagement agreement on procurement, while in the other, the AC made no criticism of\nthe costly effects that externalization had on union-management relations.ViewShow abstractShow moreThe Pay Review Body System: A Comment and a ConsequenceArticleFull-text availableSep 2000 Frank BurchillThis paper examines the role of Pay Review Bodies in the UK. It also argues that they are bodies which engage in collective bargaining rather than replacing it and therefore contradicts the conventional wisdom on this matter with important consequences in respect of the extent of coverage of collective bargaining in the UK.ViewShow abstractStrategic Negotiations: A Theory of Change in Labor-Management RelationsArticleApr 1997Richard E.
