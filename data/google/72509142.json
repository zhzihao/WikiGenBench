In Q2, the two Alpines dropped out and reserve driver Liam Lawson, who still managed to qualify handsomely in 11th. Teammate Yuki Tsunoda managed P9. Fernando Alonso also struggled and did not get beyond tenth place.\nMax Verstappen took pole position gloriously in Japan, no one could come close to him. He set a 1:28.877, followed by number 2 Oscar Piastri with a 1:29.458. With that, Verstappen cut himself loose by almost 0.6 seconds. Third position on the grid is occupied by Lando Norris. McLaren is starting a strong weekend.\nView the full results of Japan's qualifying sessionJapanese Grand Prix\nAfter the start, Lando Norris quickly grabs second position, dropping Oscar Piastri to P3. There is plenty happening behind and Bottas, Zhou and Albon get involved in crashes. Also, Sergio Perez taps Hamilton's Mercedes and soon had to go in for a new front wing. He did not keep this one in one piece for long, as he soon hit Kevin Magnussen. Again, the Mexican had to go in for a new wing and dropped out shortly thereafter. Later in the race, he did return to the track briefly to redeem his time penalty in order to go into the Qatar Grand Prix with a clean sheet. After this, he dropped out for good.Both Mercedes cars were also battling each other, with George Russell the loser, finishing in P7. Lewis Hamilton managed P5. Unfortunately, Yuki Tusnoda also failed to get any points in his home race, even though he was allowed to start from ninth position.Max Verstappen took the win, also giving Red Bull Racing the constructors' title.

With Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri highlighting McLaren's recent resurgence with podium finishes, here are 10 things we learned from the Suzuka weekend\nAuthor\nAlex Kalinauckas\nPublished\nSep 25, 2023, 1:16 PM\nUpdated\nSep 26, 2023, 10:12 AM\nCopy link\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on WhatsApp\nShare on Linkedin\nShare on Pinterest\nShare on Viber\nMax Verstappen and Red Bull winning Formula 1’s 2023 Japanese Grand Prix by a commanding 19.4-second margin might sound a very familiar tale, but this was coming one week on from their shock defeat in the Singapore race.\nThere was therefore plenty of attention being paid to the potential true impact of the twin technical directives now in force covering flexing wings and floors. But Red Bull utterly rebuffed this intrigue with its RB19’s display back at a smooth, sweeping course where the car was designed to thrive. His usual advantage restored, Verstappen was devastatingly good, while team-mate Sergio Perez had another poor weekend.\nMcLaren took up the chase, with Ferrari slipping back to third quickest but showing good progress in an important area. Then there were a few themes of the Singapore weekend cropping up again, plus the latest on Daniel Ricciardo’s injury recovery, the final moves in the driver market and a bizarre Alpine team orders spat.\nAll that and more is included here in the pick of what we learned from F1's latest visit to Suzuka.\n1. Singapore really was just a blip for Verstappen and Red Bull\nVerstappen proved that Singapore was a one-off slide from perfection for Red Bull\nPhoto by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\nJust five days on from Red Bull’s humbling in the 2023 Singapore GP, Verstappen led the pack out the pits at Suzuka. His opening flier put him well clear of the rest and the Dutchman just never looked back for the rest of a weekend where his car could return to the lower ride heights where it is designed to produce its underfloor downforce best.\nHe was utterly supreme in qualifying on this old-school and challenging track, which for 2023 had an extra challenge of high temperatures and a knock-on impact into tyre life on the rough track surface. None of it ruffled Verstappen, who delivered a stunning run between the safety car restart and his final traffic-laden stint after he’d seen off the attentions of the two McLaren cars at the start.\nPLUS: How Verstappen’s crushing Japanese GP win showed Singapore was a blip\nAfter qualifying, he quite rightly rebuked those who had lazily attributed Red Bull’s Singapore dip to any major impact of the flexi-wing and floor technical directives.\n“Honestly, yeah, we had a bad weekend,” Verstappen said. “Of course then people start talking about ‘it's all because of the technical directives’. I think they can go suck on an egg. But for my side, I was just very fired up to have a good weekend here and make sure that we were strong.”\n2. Perez must escape his current chaos to have any chance for 2024\nPerez retired twice after needing two front wing changes in a handful of laps\nPhoto by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images\nWhile Verstappen was untouchable in qualifying, it was still a shock that Red Bull didn’t lock out the front row, such was the RB19’s prowess in the sweeping, technical opening sector here. That was down to Perez “struggling was mainly in the high-speed corners compared to Max”, per Red Bull team boss Christian Horner, plus only having one set of new softs left in Q3.\nThen in the main event, Perez’s slightly slow getaway undid his race as the pack pinching left towards the racing line – a move actually innocently triggered by Charles Leclerc’s Ferrari on the inside – meant he collided with Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes coming by on the outside. That meant needing to pit for a new front wing, but in doing so Perez passed Fernando Alonso under the safety car at the pitlane entrance, which earned a five-second penalty.\nAfter the restart he clattered into Kevin Magnussen, got another penalty for it and had to retire with his car damaged from both shunts. Then there were the stunning scenes of Red Bull sending him back out to serve his penalty for the Magnussen shunt via a rules loophole, which was canny thinking from the team but only served to be the highlight of Perez’s awful race. This included stop one pitlane exit confusion behind the safety car and running slowly under the VSC to confuse Norris as he came by to lap the Red Bull.\nThe 2023 world title is all but over and had been long lost after his strong start. Ending the season with this current run of crashes firmly in the past must be Perez’s focus now, or he’ll go into 2024 with even more pressure on his F1 future.\n3.

Ferrari’s tyre degradation weakness really does look better, with Leclerc shining at Sukuka\nFerrari's resurgence continued at Suzuka, with Leclerc taking a marked step forward\nPhoto by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images\nAfter being outshone by team-mate Carlos Sainz since the summer break, Leclerc rather struck back by being the lead driver for Ferrari across the Japan weekend sessions that mattered.\nPLUS:Why Sainz’s Singapore F1 success was not just about DRS genius\nHis race pace, all while stopping relatively early given the undercut’s power here, meant he was at times in range to threaten Piastri. Leclerc actually thought he was racing for a podium, after mistaking the hobbled Perez for Verstappen around the VSC. But result of fourth on a track not suited to the SF-23 and the hot conditions and track surface combination represents an excellent result overall, after he’d headed Perez in qualifying too.\nLeclerc felt “another weekend like this is good in a way because it confirms exactly what we understood in the last few races” regarding improving on tyre life – Ferrari’s major weakness in the season’s early phase. Team boss Fred Vasseur actually felt “we were probably a bit too conservative” on tyre management pace compared to McLaren, all of which is encouraging for Ferrari’s future on weekends where Red Bull and others are at full strength.\n5.

Alpine’s driver line-up can still be combustible\nGasly was furious at being ordered to allow team-mate Ocon back through on the final lap\nPhoto by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\nAlpine: Gasly/Ocon late switch in F1 Japanese GP right thing to do\n7. Verstappen should’ve been penalised for his Singapore impeding\nVerstappen's pair of reprimands in Singapore caused eyebrows to be raised\nPhoto by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\nWhy AlphaTauri skipped Verstappen's Singapore F1 impeding hearing\n8. AlphaTauri’s 2024 Tsunoda/Ricciardo line-up leaves impressive Lawson still looking in\nLawson has impressed as cover for Ricciardo but must wait for his next F1 chance\nPhoto by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\nAhead of qualifying for the Suzuka race, AlphaTauri announced that it would retain its regular line-up of Tsunoda and the injured Daniel Ricciardo for 2024 – the latter only promoted to Faenza and Bicester-based team’s roster for the pre-summer break Hungarian GP at the expense of Nyck de Vries.\nThis decision means Liam Lawson, who has subbed in for Ricciardo since the Australian’s F1 comeback was punctured by his hand injury in a Zandvoort practice crash, is set to only remain reserve driver for both Red Bull and AlphaTauri next year. This is despite the New Zealander, who could still yet win the 2023 Super Formula championship where he has been racing full-time this year, putting in a series of impressive performances. These include scoring his maiden points in Singapore and with Tsunoda’s overall form remaining patchy.\nPLUS:How Tsunoda has eliminated a crucial F1 limitation\nRicciardo was always considered certain to be retained by AlphaTauri for 2024 given his experience level and huge profile just as the team is set to undergo its second major rebrand since Red Bull bought the former Minardi squad and made it is junior team for 2005. But Lawson is thought likely to continue his 2023 F1 cameo bow in place of Ricciardo until the next round in Qatar, if the latter cannot demonstrate he has recovered sufficiently during simulator running for the returning Losail event in the coming days.\nIt also remains possible that Lawson could be a candidate to replace Sargeant at Williams, with the American lacking a contract for next year and being involved in a series of incidents and underwhelming performances in his maiden campaign. Red Bull and Williams have form in doing deals over reserve drivers, which is how Alex Albon was able to rejoin the F1 grid in a race role for 2022.\n9. Gasly wants Alpine to narrow its cockpit size for 2024, at long-armed Ocon’s expense\nGasly and Ocon are split on a key design issue\nPhoto by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images\nAnother more minor but still intriguing detail for the 2024 season also emerged over the Suzuka weekend: that Gasly wants Alpine to narrow its cockpit size to gain aerodynamic performance for next year after finding he had excess room aboard the A523 in 2023.\nGasly, who joined Alpine from AlphaTauri to race alongside fellow Frenchman Ocon for this year, explained this had been made so because “we've got one tall driver with long arms and long limbs”. Ocon is 6ft1, while Gasly is 5ft8.\nPLUS: Why the reality of F1 engineering debriefs isn't what Drive to Survive makes out\n“We're kind of going in the same direction,” Gasly said of Alpine’s 2024 car design preparation in the run up to the Japanese race. “Apart from the very long arms that he has! I'm requesting a tighter cockpit for obvious gains and he's not so keen.\n“I don't know how he drives, but he needs slightly more space than me. We'll see how that goes, but I must say that's probably the only area where he'll favour comfort over maybe more bias towards performance.”\n10.
