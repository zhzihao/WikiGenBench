They raised slogans and sang songs, and formed a casual collective where various issues were discussed.\nThe collective was led by members of Women’s Action Forum (WAF) as well as students.\nIn Pakistan, Feb 12 is a milestone in the country’s women’s rights movement. On this day in 1983, several women defied the military dictatorship of Gen Ziaul Haq by taking out a public demonstration on Lahore’s The Mall road despite martial law regulations that banned all political activity, processions and public protests.\n“The primary reason for this demonstration was the proposed law of evidence, which would effectively have reduced the testimony of women to half of that of men,” said Farida Shaheed, who was a part of the historic protest.\nThe accumulative trigger was the dictatorship’s unrelenting push to rescind women’s rights and reduce their status to half a human. This demonstration became a symbol for women’s resistance to all forms of oppression and belief in an equal, equitable and just democratic order.\nLike many others who were present at the 1983 protest, Ms Shaheed remembers it vividly. “Section 144 had been imposed so Hina Jilani had an idea that we should reach the high court in small groups of twos and threes and protest there,” she recalls. “But when we reached Hall Road, we could see that there was already a lot of police who had cordoned off the road so we couldn’t go ahead.”\nThe sheer number of police meant that the state was prepared to fight the civilians, so it was bad news for everyone.\n“At Hall Road, Habib Jalib began reciting his poetry and then all of a sudden we realised that one of the protesters, Mubaraka, from Democratic Women’s Association had slipped through the barriers and was gesturing for us to follow her,” said Ms Shaheed.\nSuddenly, there were clouds of tear gas and a brutal baton-charge by police on the demonstrating civilians. Several women were dragged to the police station and locked up.\nActivist Diep Saeeda was only in college and was passing by The Mall when she was caught up in the demonstration. “I did not know her personally, but saw that Madeeha (Gauhar) was bleeding after being hit by a baton,” she recalls. “I was crying as well as trying to take care of her bleeding head.”\nWhile there was a smile on the women’s faces who were shouting slogans for freedom and justice, a serious underlying issue remains relevant even today.\n“State oppression in those days was through a military dictatorship,” added Ms Saeeda. “Today, even in a so-called civilian government, our freedom is being snatched from us and we are being pushed to the wall.”\nTakreema, a theatre artist and activist, said that young women at that time were more in touch with their identities and desires.\n“Today, the average educated woman is weighed down by responsibilities as well as pressure from family and society; there is active discouragement for students to take part in such things while families believe girls’ reputations are at stake.”\nSixty-five-year-old Parveen looked wistfully and smilingly at the women and girls who were loud and clear about their identities and what they wanted from society.\n“I was stopped from studying further – as most women are, but after I had three daughters, my mindset changed and I pushed them to educate themselves and be economically independent,” she said.\nWAF released a statement that stated that the forum would always stand up to the “state’s deliberately created and fostered religious terrorists as part of its security doctrine, the groups who hold the country hostage through violent protests against any attempts to make Pakistan a tolerant and progressive state, those undermining the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution, violence and injustice against women and other marginalised sections of society”.\nPublished in Dawn, February 13th, 2019\nEmail\nYour Name*Recipient Email*Cancel\n4\nRead more\nPM forms committee to ensure ‘smooth conduct’, security arrangements of Feb 8 polls\nFinal list of candidates for general elections to be released once court cases are settled: ECP\nNawaz finally partakes in PML-N election rally, vows to make Pakistan ‘stand on its own feet’\nSponsored\nEmpowering millions: Dr. Amjad Saqib’s fight against global poverty through microfinance\nOn DawnNews\nمردہ شخص کے نام پر ووٹ ڈالنے کی کیا سزا ہے؟\nپنجاب میں 10ہزار طلبہ کو بلاسود، آسان شرائط پر الیکٹرک بائیکس دینے کا اعلان\n‘وقت آگیا ہے بائیڈن انتظامیہ اسرائیل کے لیے اپنی حمایت پر نظرثانی کرے’\nDawn News English\nIt Was Our Right: Bilawal Backs Pakistan’s Response To Iran’s Airspace Violation\nPakistan Responded To Iran’s Cross-Border Attack\nTop News: 300 Palestinian Sports Clubs Call To Ban Israel From Olympic Games\nHow Is The World Reacting To Iran-Pakistan Conflict?\nPakistan Elections: Has Anything Changed?\nWhat is Happening Between Iran And Pakistan?\nPakistan Is Not Interested In Escalating Tensions With Iran: Kamran Yousaf\nIran Has Distracted The World And Region From Gaza: Analyst\nComments (4) Closed\nPopular\nNewest\nOldest\nGordon D.

Many other cities staged their respective Aurat March.A few hundred women, mostly educated and upper-middle-class, participated in the first such event in Lahore in 2018.Since then, the scope of these marches has been growing exponentially, assuming an intersectional character with the participation of working-class, LGBTQ, non-binary women and allies.AdvertisementAs the movement has continued to grow, so has the hostility and backlash against it. Critics have argued that the march, along with its slogans and placards, is against the fabric of Pakistani society where women are considered symbols of domesticity, honour and respectability. Ironically, women participants at Aurat March, who speak up against rape and abuse, are the ones who have received online rape and death threats from anti-Aurat March trolls.According to a Punjab Police report, 2,043 rape cases and 111 gang rape cases were registered in the Punjab province alone between January and August this year.NewsPakistan Gang Rape Sparks Nationwide Protests After Cop Blames WomanPallavi Pundir09.12.20Earlier this month, the gang rape of a woman in front of her children on the motorway in Lahore, sparked national outrage. The comments made byUmer Sheikh, the Lahore City Capital Police Officer, drew severe criticism after he blamed the survivor for being out at night. The protests that were held in major cities on September 12 demanded Sheikh’s resignation.There were cries for justice for Gul Panra, a transgender woman, who was murdered in Peshawar city around the same time as the motorway gang rape. Women also urged justice for Marwa, a five-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in Karachi, earlier this month.Mera jism meri marzi (translated to ‘my body, my choice’) was the prominent slogan shouted amongst other chants at the protests.The slogan has been at the heart of contention in Pakistan since it first appeared at the 2019 Aurat March. “When I heard ‘My body my choice’, my first reaction was ‘Of course, my body, my choice! How is that even something people will argue about?’” digital artist, Shehzil Malik, who has been designing posters for the Aurat March’s Lahore chapter for the last two years, told VICE News. “This is such a conservative society. Even saying something like ‘I have rights over my own body’ immediately becomes sexual.”AdvertisementNews‘I Face Rape Threats Daily’: What It’s Like Being a Female Journalist in PakistanMahwish Qayyum09.18.20The slogan is widely perceived as a corrupting force espoused by ‘loose’ liberal women, while the message of reproductive rights, bodily autonomy and anti-rape, is entirely overlooked. Mera jism meri marzi has caused such fissions in Pakistani society that even those who are enraged by the motorway gang-rape incident choose to dissociate themselves from the slogan.For Pakistani feminists, the slogan has become a rallying cry for defiance against patriarchy and sexual violence.Minerwa Tahir, former co-convenor of Women Democratic Front (Lahore) told VICE News, “In my view, it has a very important link with the Global Women’s Strike,” referring to an international grassroots women’s network that began in 2000. Minerwa asserts that globally, neoliberal governments’ austerity measures have impoverished working-class women, prompting them to take to the streets and form the movement.In Pakistan, working-class women’s increased participation and visibility, especially at the Aurat March this year, are directly linked to economic assaults on them.Though women in Pakistan marching in the streets seems unprecedented, they have staged major marches in the past.On February 12, 1983, women in Lahore protested against the regime of the military dictator General Zia ul Haq and his Islamisation laws, particularly the Hudood Ordinance, which was discriminatory against women.Women protesters were beaten up by the police and some were even jailed. Although democracy was restored in 1988, the Zia regime’s conservative policies had an enduring effect on the country. “He has managed to ingrain and inculcate a particular version of conservative and non-democratic Islamic notions in state as well as society,” said Farida Shaheed, member of Women’s Action Forum and Executive Director of Shirkat Gah, a women’s resource network.As a young woman, Shaheed participated in the 1983 protest.Gender-based violence has escalated in Pakistan during the pandemic. A mother, a young girl of five, and a transgender woman were brutalised, all within one month. These recurring atrocities further reinforce the need for the Aurat March in Lahore and other marches across Pakistan.Follow Olivia Qasir on TwitterTagged:ΠακιστάνAurat March violenceWomens DayrapepoliceKarachilahoreworldnewsGet the latest from VICE News in your inbox.
