Europe emerged from a period of darkness into the renaissance era to introduce new innovative and progressive elements to the people’s lives.\nGardens were designed and created to relax and enjoy the natural beauty of the landscapes. With the renaissance’s emergence, new garden styles and designs were introduced. These were different from medieval gardens. They didn’t shy away from being expanded outward, including the surrounding landscapes as a part of their designs. These gardens were the definition and symbol of harmony, unity, and aesthetics, complimenting nature.\nStatues in the Borghese Gardens in Rome_©Gabriella Clare Marino via Unsplash\nItalian Renaissance Gardens: a Fascination\nRenaissance gardens were established in Europe by the late fifteenth century with a new garden concept in mind. Compared to the classical gardens before, this one was created using a formal and geometric approach with heavily decorated ornamental patterns. The rise of these splendid gardens was candy to the eyes of the spectators. Further, it was believed to enhance the prestige of the people in power. The aim was to create an extraordinary place that blends fantasy and reality and makes an everlasting impression. Most of the inspiration for the Italian renaissance gardens was classical mythology, Italian art, and literary resources. The grandeur of these gardens can still be witnessed through the paintings of that time, adorned with pergolas, water mazes, sculptures, and detailed topiaries.\nVilla d’Este in Tivoli _©via Wikipedia\nElements of Renaissance Gardens\nThe various elements included in the design of these gardens are essential when discussing renaissance gardens. Even today, these details and features define the finesse of these gardens and make them stand out in their beauty and admiration from others.\nAxially Symmetrical Designs\nThe catchy element of renaissance gardens is that they were curated along an axis. This axis stays between the start of a building, such as a villa, to where the garden ends. This element, where the garden can be procured as a complete mirror image, adds definition to the whole design and escalates its overall look. The result is a grid pattern of sorts, like a square with perpendicular spaces called pathways that runs along this axis. A low fence bordered these spaces.\nHamilton Gardens_©Roy Javier via Unsplash\nCoherent and Flawless Design\nThe gardens during the renaissance were treated as an extension of the villas. These villas were built considering gardens as outdoor rooms and blended with nature. The villas were extended outdoors by posing terraces and courtyards as outdoor spaces while drawing gardens to bring them to the interiors.\nVilla Lante_©via Wikipedia\nGreen is a Dominating Color\nWith the inclusion of elaborate topiaries and other ornamental details, renaissance gardens were keen on showcasing green as the centre of attention. These spectacular topiaries were made into sculptures by continuously growing and using boxwood, Italian cypress, junipers, and rosemary. Renaissance gardens used these topiaries to symbolise order and harmony in nature.\nThe Palazzo Piccolomini, Tuscany_©via discover Tuscany\nOther Features\nIt is essential to acknowledge the detailed elements that complete the Italian renaissance gardens. These extra but prominent elements include sculptures and water features of these gardens. The statues and sculptures were mainly of Roman gods and goddesses. Water as a feature became necessary due to the hot climate of Italy, and it was implemented in the form of fountains and ponds to add an extra touch of magic to the gardens.\nVilla Lante Pegasus_©via Wikipedia\nExamples of Italian Renaissance Gardens\nThe foundation for the Italian renaissance gardens was mainly formed in Florence and Rome. These gardens were considered the epicentre of a way to relax, entertain, and retreat. Renaissance gardens were also pioneers in increasing the study of botany during this time with the study of exotic plants.\nVilla Medici in Fiesole is one of the most notable and oldest examples of Italian renaissance gardens. Settled in Florence, this renaissance garden is one of the first villas built on the hillside with terrace gardens overlooking the bustling city. Another famous example of a garden extended from a villa and located on the hillside is the Villa d’Este in Tivoli. This particular example was well known for its extensive water features with over 51 fountains and 64 waterfalls, along with ponds and water jets. Many Italian renaissance gardens still look magnificent and stand popular because of their fame and beauty. Some examples are Sacro Bosco, the garden that started the trend of a renaissance garden with no axial symmetry, and Villa Borghese, the third largest public park in Italy.\nVilla Medici in Fiesole, Firenze_©via Wikipedia\nFrench Renaissance Gardens\nWith the rise of Italian renaissance gardens, progress was introduced and shifted to many European countries, including France. However, French renaissance gardens were different as they had an increased perspective and space conception in their designs, but the main elements were the same. The first ever French renaissance garden is considered to be the Domain Royal de Chateau-Gaillard. Inspired by the Italian renaissance gardens, King Charles VIII bought Italian artists to build this garden. Another notable French renaissance garden is the Palace of Versailles.\nChateau Gaillard_©via Wikipedia\nEnglish Renaissance Gardens\nThe late 15th century witnessed the rise of the English renaissance gardens, which were slightly different from the Italian and French. English gardens were created as a connection between the homes and the gardens, including knot gardens, ornamental plants, and mounts. Apart from their aim of providing relaxation and retreatment, these gardens were the embodiment of wealth. The best example to understand the English renaissance garden and its features is Kenilworth Castle and Elizabethan Garden.\nGardens at Hampton Court Palace_©via Smithsonian Magazine\nRenaissance Gardens and Modern Landscape Designs\nIt is clear that over the years, Italy has immensely influenced other countries and generations to take inspiration from their gardens to make their own. Their skilful design and attention to detail, along with the features of statues and use of water, not only establish its elegance but radiates amusement in the viewers. And the influence of renaissance gardens is seen in modern-day landscape designs. In recent years, landscape designers have proved that we owe the renaissance gardens for implementing those simple elements in the present day, creating a magnificent garden full of surprises.\nIt might be tricky to include all the features of renaissance gardens in today’s landscape, especially axial symmetry. Axial symmetry was added to create a garden of grand gestures, but in the 21st-century landscape, these are not essentially important. But today’s landscapes still achieve this by uniformly planting trees on both sides of the entrance to provide order and harmony. In addition to that, adding topiaries and different shapes to the garden has changed the landscape designs. A well-designed rectangle or square space in the garden always adds a touch of magic to the area. It is evident that water features and planting a variety of functional but beautiful flora enhances the landscape and looks similar to the renaissance gardens.\nModern day garden design_©via GardeningEtc\nConclusion\nIt can be said that renaissance gardens have influenced a great deal for future gardens since the 15th century. Gardens of today are not often magnificent as the renaissance gardens. However, it is still commendable that they possess elements that define them. The future might take a different turn and style for landscape design. Still, whatever the year might be, the influence from the past is always notable and inspiring.\nReferences:\n‌\nStatues in the Borghese Gardens in Rome_©Gabriella Clare Marino via Unsplash\nVilla d’Este in Tivoli _©via Wikipedia\nHamilton Gardens_©Roy Javier via Unsplash\nVilla Lante_©via Wikipedia\nThe Palazzo Piccolomini, Tuscany_©via discover Tuscany\nVilla Lante Pegasus_©via Wikipedia\nVilla Medici in Fiesole, Firenze_©via Wikipedia\nChateau Gaillard_©via Wikipedia\nGardens at Hampton Court Palace_©via Smithsonian Magazine\nModern day garden design_©via GardeningEtc\nArchitecturedesignEuropelandscapeRenaissanceRenaissance gardens\nPrev Post\nAn architectural review of a location: Norway\n8 Mins Read\nNext Post\nIs everything thing having a historical background, considered as ‘Heritage’\n5 Mins Read\nRelated Posts\nUrban parks projects everyone should know\nJanuary 18, 2024\nJanuary 17, 2024\nJanuary 15, 2024\nIndia: Noteworthy Vernacular Buildings\nJanuary 11, 2024\nResponsive Design for Aging Populations: Crafting Spaces for All Ages\nJanuary 10, 2024\n20 Best art museums in Israel\nJanuary 4, 2024\nJoin Now\nHow to Design Architecture Portfolio\nThe Ultimate Thesis Guide\nComplete Architecture Package for Design Studios\nComplete Architecture Package for Students\nHow to Get Your Projects Published | Online Course\nHow To Build A Brand For A Design Studio | Online Course\nIntroduction to Architectural Journalism | Online Course\nDesign Thinking in Architecture | Online Course\nIntroduction to Landscape Architecture | Online Course\nIntroduction to Urban Design | Online Course\nHow to Use Biomimicry in Architecture | Online Course\nIntroduction to Product Design | Online Course\nHow to Design Streets | Online Course\nIntroduction to Passive Design Strategies | Online Course\nIntroduction to Skyscraper Design | Online Course\nHow to Design Affordable Housing | Online Course\nComplete Guide to Dissertation Writing | Online Course\nThe Ultimate Masters Guide For Architects | Online Course\nThe Perfect Guide to Architecting your Career | Online Course\nComplete Architecture Package for Design Studios v 3.0\nComplete Architecture Package for Students v 3.0\nTest\nAbout RTF\nContact RTF\nRTF Content Policy\nRTF Privacy Policy\nRTF Terms & Condition\nIn\nProduct Design\n5 Stylish Lamps to Perfectly Complement Your Home or Workplace Decor by Illuminate Your Space\n3 Mins Read\nIn\nCommercial Interior Design\nMinistry of Grill by Saar Interior Design\n3 Mins Read\nIn\nTechnologies\nMaximizing Connectivity: eSIM Solutions for UK Travelers\n7 Mins Read\nIn\nInterior Design\nReflection by Studio BluOra\n3 Mins Read\nIn\nArchitects' Lounge\nThis Architectural Exhibition got 10,000 Visitors at Milan Design Week\n3 Mins Read\nIn\nHospitality\nLimestone Gallery | He Wei Studio | 3andwich Design\n3 Mins Read\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nPinterest\nDribbble\n©2022 Rethinking The Future All registered.

Opens in new tab.\nBody Content Gardens are rich with associations: the Garden of Eden is an earthly paradise; botanical gardens are places to study and appreciate the world of plant life; our home herb and flower gardens are sites of pleasure, sustenance, leisure, and sometimes chores. The gardens we encounter in works of art from the Renaissance in Europe, from about 1400 to 1600, similarly reveal a range of meanings and functions—several of which resonate with our own contemporary ideas. Here is a visual introduction to Renaissance gardens and their symbolism, with images drawn from illuminated manuscripts in the Getty Museum’s collection. Several of these are on view in the exhibition Gardens of the Renaissance.\nKitchen Gardens\nA kitchen garden—hortus in Latin or orto in Italian—was often part of a landed estate or attached to a simple home. These sites produced plants for sustenance and profit, often providing taxable income. In the illumination below, individuals harvest the plantings from a vineyard and orchard. Harvest Scene (entire illumination, left, and detail, right), completed before 1340, attributed to Illustratore (Andrea da Bologna?). Cutting from New Digest. Tempera colors, gold leaf, and ink on parchment, 5 11/16 x 3 in. Getty Museum, Ms. 13, verso Urban Gardens\nThe urban garden or hortus urbanus, to borrow a phrase coined by the 15th-century theorist Leon Battista Alberti, combined the dignity of a city house with the delights of a country villa and provided a place free from the restrictions of urban society. These gardens were sites of contemplative withdrawal. In the illumination here, angels tend a garden attached to the Virgin Mary’s home, pictured here with early-16th-century architecture. The Annunciation (detail) in the Spinola Hours, about 1510–20, Master of James IV of Scotland. Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment, 9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in. Getty Museum, Ms.Ludwig IX 18, fol. 92v Herb Gardens\nAn herb or simples garden was often located near a private residence, a pharmacy, or university, and was used for the production of medicinal remedies. Here, a young couple watch as gardeners till the soil in the garden in early spring. March: Gardening; Zodiacal Sign of Aries (detail) in the Spinola Hours, about 1510–1520, Workshop of the Master of James IV of Scotland. Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment, 9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in. Getty Museum, Ms. Ludwig IX 18, fol. 2v Cloister Gardens\nThe gardens found in monasteries or cloisters were often referred to as paradise on earth, a reference to the Garden of Eden, portrayed here—in another beautiful example from the Spinola Hours—with lush colors and abundant green. Saint Jerome Reading (detail) in the Spinola Hours, about 1510–20, Workshop of the Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian. Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment, 9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in. Getty Museum, Ms. Ludwig IX 18, fol. 223v\nGet Inspired"
