The church was consecrated in 1848. Visitors can wander around the graveyard and read the inscriptions on many of the settlers' tombstones, which are still in their original state. These include those of the Bussell family, one of the first European families to settle in the area.\nSt Mary’s Church Busselton\nOpen 24 Hours\n43 Peel Terrace, Busselton WA 6280, Australia\n4.8\n08 9754 3775\nEmail\nSpeak to a local expert\nAdvice from a Local\nSpeak to a local expert\nBook Direct\nWe're a not-for-profit local tourism association that helps you book direct with local businesses.\nThings To Do\nAttractions & Outdoor Activities\nTours & Guided Experiences\nEat & Drink\nWineries\nBreweries & Distilleries\nFamily Holidays\nEvents & What’s On\nHealth & Wellness\nSelf Drive Itineraries & Routes\nLocal Recommendations\nAboriginal Culture\nSustainable Travel\nTowns of the Region\nBusselton\nDunsborough\nYallingup\nCowaramup & Gracetown\nMargaret River\nAugusta\nSurrounding the Region\nPlan Your Trip\nAccommodation\nDeals & Special Offers\nGetting Here & Local Transport\nWelcoming Travel\nAccessibility\nMaps & Guides\nVisitor Information Centres\nWeather & Climate\nWeddings & Special Occasions\nLocal Services\nTravel Safety & Emergency Services\nMember Website\nor\nlogin here\n© 2021 Margaret River Region ABN: 62 934 317 700\nSitemap\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nBooking Terms & Conditions\nGo"
