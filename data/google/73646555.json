It represented a break with traditional practice, and caused widespread debate at the time.\nThe decision was finally taken to allow the couple to marry and the engagement was announced.\nOfficial announcement\nThe engagement was officially announced on 19 March 1968. The President of the Storting, Mr Bernt Ingvaldsen presented the following message from King Olav to the Storting (Norwegian parliament):\n“It is with pleasure that I inform you, Mr President and Members of the Storting, that I, after seeking advice from the Prime Minister, members of the Government, you, Mr President, and the parliamentary leaders of the political parties, have today given my consent to my dear son, Crown Prince Harald, to take as his wife Miss Sonja Haraldsen, daughter of the late Mr Karl August Haraldsen and Mrs Dagny Haraldsen née Ulrichsen.”\nShortly after the announcement, flags were flown on all public buildings in honour of the news.\nThe wedding ceremony\nThe wedding ceremony took place at 5:00 pm on 29 August 1968. Oslo was adorned with flags and flowers, and many shop windows displayed photos and the monogram of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess. Nearly 3 000 soldiers representing all the branches of the armed forces stood shoulder to shoulder, lining the procession route from the Royal Palace to Oslo Cathedral.\nThe first of the some 850 invited wedding guests began to arrive at Oslo Cathedral at 3:00 pm. The cathedral was decorated with more than 2 500 roses, marguerites, freesias, sweet peas and gladioli. At 4:30 pm the carillon at Oslo City Hall started to play and the procession of 19 automobiles began to make its way from the Palace. Crown Prince Harald rode in one of the first automobiles with his best man, Count Flemming Valdemar of Rosenborg.\nThe bride entered the church on the arm of King Olav, to the tones of Henry Purcell’s “Trumpet Tune and Air”. During the wedding ceremony, the Norwegian Student Choral Society (a men’s choir) sang the hymn “Herre Gud ditt dyre navn og ære” (Our Lord God, Your Precious Name and Honour), and opera singer Ms Aase Nordmo Løvberg sang the hymn “Alt står i Guds Faders hånd” (Everything Rests in God the Father’s Hand).\nThe bride and groom exited the cathedral to the strains of J. S. Bach’s “Prelude in E Major”, and were met with jubilation and cheers of congratulations by the large crowds waiting outside. Two 21-gun salutes were fired from Akershus Fortress.\nThe wedding festivities lasted for three days and were attended by a large number of guests.\nThe bridal gown\nThe Crown Princess’s simple, classically styled bridal gown had three-quarter length sleeves and a long train, and was decorated with white pearls and embroidery. She wore a long tulle veil and carried a bouquet in shades of white, with white roses, freesias, lilies of the valley and orchids.\n14.07.2011\nTo share this on Twitter or Facebook:\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nDown the aisle\nKing Olav leading the bride down the aisle (Photo: NTB / Scanpix)\nPhoto 1 of 6\nEnlarge\nDown the aisle\nKing Olav leading the bride down the aisle (Scanpix, Archive)\nPhoto 2 of 6\nEnlarge\nWaving\nThe bride and groom outside the cathedral (Foto: NTB / Scanpix)\nPhoto 3 of 6\nEnlarge\nIn the car\nTravelling from the cathedral to the Royal Palace (Photo: NTB archives / Scanpix)\nPhoto 4 of 6\nEnlarge\nThe Waltz\nWaltzing at The Royal Palace (Photo: NTB Archives/ Scanpix)\nPhoto 5 of 6\nEnlarge\nInvitation\nInvitation to the wedding ceremony (Photo: Jan Haug, The Royal Court Archives)\nPhoto 6 of 6\nEnlarge\nLinks\nNORSK\nSÁMEGIELLA\nENGLISH\nBarnesider\nsite map\ncontact us\nStatement of accessibility"

When King Harald ascended to the Throne upon the death of King Olav, Queen Sonja became Norway's first queen in 53 years.\nMiss Sonja Haraldsengrew up in the district of Vinderen in Oslo and first met Crown Prince Harald in 1959. It was not until nine years later, however, that she and the Crown Prince were given permission to marry. In March 1968 it was announced that King Olav had given his consent for the Crown Prince to marry a commoner.\nThe engagement between Miss Haraldsen and Crown Prince Harald triggered a debate regarding the future of the monarchy in Norway. There was far less resistance to the idea of the Crown Prince choosing a commoner to be his wife than many had feared. The Norwegian people immediately accepted Crown Princess Sonja as a member of the Royal Family. The wedding was held in Oslo Cathedral on 29 August 1968, and Miss Sonja Haraldsen became the Crown Princess of Norway. King Harald and Queen Sonja have two children, Princess Märtha Louise, born on 22 September 1971, and Crown Prince Haakon, born on 20 July 1973.\nConsecration ceremony\nQueen Sonja accompanied King Harald when he swore his oath to uphold the Constitution in the Storting on 21 January 1991. This marked the first time in 69 years that a Norwegian Queen had been present in the Storting. Subsequently, the Queen, frequently together with Crown Prince Haakon, has accompanied the King to the formal opening of the fall session of the Storting and the reading of the Speech from the Throne.\nIn accordance with their own wishes, King Harald and Queen Sonja were consecrated in Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 23 June 1991. In connection with the consecration ceremony, the King and Queen conducted a 10-day tour of Southern Norway. The following year, the entire Royal Family conducted a 22-day tour of Norway’s four northernmost counties.\nOfficial duties as Queen\nThe Queen accompanies the King on official state visits abroad, and she participates when foreign heads of state pay official visits to Norway.\nEvery year the King and Queen usually pay a visit to a county in Norway. Their stay lasts 2-3 days, during which time they pay visits to several municipalities. They often use the Royal Yacht Norge to travel along the Norwegian coast.\nThe Queen carries out a multitude of different tasks including travelling, official visits, participation at events all over the country, audiences, receptions and meetings at the Royal Palace. In addition to her many official duties the Queen also takes active part in following up internal activities relating to the Palace and the other Royal Residences.\nSocial engagement\nQueen Sonja has a strong sense of social engagement. She has been patron of and has played an active role in a variety of large-scale fundraising initiatives. Queen Sonja was a member of the committee for the first nationwide humanitarian telethon campaign in 1974, which raised funds for refugees. The Queen also served as patron for the telethon campaigns in 2010, 2016 and 2019. Queen Sonja served as Vice President of the Norwegian Red Cross from 1987 to 1990. Her Majesty was awarded the Nansen Medal by theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for her efforts.\nThe Queen seeks to follow up her interest in social issues to the greatest extent possible,attending conferences and key events for organisations dealing with relevant issues. Every year before Christmas Queen Sonja pays visits to institutions for various social groups such as children, vulnerable women, elderly people, the homeless and substance abusers. The Queen is also concerned with conditions for immigrant women in Norway. She has met with representatives of women with minority backgrounds on many occasions, in connection with conferences, seminars and receptions at the Palace as well as through visits to private homes. Queen Sonja is patron of the MIRA Centre for Black, Immigrant and Refugee Women.\nThe Queen has a strong commitment to schooling and education. In 2005, she took the initiative to establish Queen Sonja’s School Award. The award is presented every other year to a Norwegian school that has demonstrated excellence in its efforts to promote inclusion and equality. The award is administered by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, which also appoints a jury to select the year’s recipient. The award consists of a cash prize of NOK 250000 and a signed print by the Queen.\nCultural interests\nQueen Sonja has many interests that she combines with her duties as Norway’s First Lady.\nThe Queen is particularly interested in art and culture, and attend art exhibitions and cultural events both in Norway and abroad as her programme will allow. She is also concerned with monuments of the past, and is patron of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments.\nThe Queen is greatly interested in the visual arts. Works from her private art collection were exhibited near Oslo in 2001, 2012 and 2022, and at Scandinavian House in New York in 2005. In 2011, the Queen established Her Majesty Queen Sonja’s Art Award in cooperation with artists Kjell Nupen, Ørnulf Opdahl and Ole Larsen. The award was initially presented to Nordic artists working in a paper-based format. The first recipient was Finnish graphic artist Tiina Kivinen in 2012. In 2014, the prize became an international distinction and was renamed the Queen Sonja Print Award. The first international recipient was US visual artist Tauba Auerbach in 2016.\nThe Foundation behind the Queen Sonja Print Award seeks to generate interest in and promote the development of graphic art. The prize is currently believed to be the world’s largest graphic art award.\nIn recent years the Queen herself has become a graphic artist and ceramicist, and her works have been on display in a number of exhibitions in Norway and abroad.\nAnother of the Queen’s major interests is music. She is patron of the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, the Oslo Chamber Music Festival, the Norwegian Traditional Music and Dance Association, theNorwegian Youth Orchestra Association and Elverum Music Festival. She is also actively involved in the Queen Sonja Singing Competition. This competiton is held every other year and attracts outstandingyoung singerswithin opera and classical music from all over the world. Her Majesty follows the competition and presents the prizes to the winners.\nOutdoor activities\nIn Norway, the Queen is renowned for her interest in nature, outdoor recreation and the environment. There is scarcely a place in the country that the Queen has not visited. Several hiking trails and nature paths bear her name, and she is an honorary member of the Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT). The Queen’s concern about nature conservation and the environment has become more visible in recent years through her participation in clean-up actions.\nThe Queen is a keen photographer, and often takes photographs of her trips in Norway. On several occasions, in Norway and abroad, Queen Sonja has given lectures and talks on Norway as a tourist destination at which she has shown her private photographs.\n19.04.2023\nTo share this on Twitter or Facebook:\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nQueen Sonja\nHM Queen Sonja (Photo: Cathrine Wessel)\nPhoto 1 of 1\nEnlarge\nNORSK\nSÁMEGIELLA\nENGLISH\nBarnesider\nsite map\ncontact us\nStatement of accessibility"

Love defeats\nTHREE PAGES FOR WOMEN\nNORWAY celebrated last Thursday the marriage of its Crown Prince to a com- moner. Although Prince Harold's choice of bride aroused some controversy and criticism, most Norwegians approve the\nmatch.\nLove defeats\nFrom a Special Correspondent\nin Oslo\nTO be, or not to be a kingdom? From time to time Norwe-\ngians ask themselves this question, and it was raised again before the marriage last Thursday of Crown Prince Harald to a commoner, Miss Sonja Haraldsen.\nAlthough the bride is attractive, charming and well educated, opposition to the match has been so strong from some con- servative quarters that ten years have elapsed between the 31-year-old couple's first meeting and the celebration of their marriage.\nThere are older Nor- wegians who are so proud of the strong links that their royal family has with the other royal\nfamilies of Europe that they believe Crown Prince Harald should\nhave given up his claim to the throne rather than\nmarry a commoner.\nnone Help\nOne elderly woman, on hearing from an approv- ing hairdresser the news of the engagement, was so indignant that she flounced out of the salon, curlers and all, and was\nnever seen ther again.\nSuch diehard conserva- tism is matched only by those Norwegians who, while approving of Har- ald's choice of a Nor- wegian girl in preference to some foreign princess, think that the name \"Sonja\" is too Russian and should be changed.\nIt is surprising that there should be such an old fashioned royalist element in Norway. All aristocratic titles were abolished as long ago as 1818 and the present royal family has been on the Norwegian throne only since 1905, when Norway achieved full independence after centuries of domination first by Denmark and then by Sweden.\nPrince Carl, son of\nOpposition overcome: Crown Prince Harald of Norway and Crown Princess Sonfa, for merly Miss Sonfa Haraldsen, wave to cheering crowds as they drive'from Oslo Cathedral to the royal castle after their wedding last Thursday. Help\nOpposition overcome: Crown Prince Harald of Norway and Crown Princess Sonja, for- merly Miss Sonja Haraldsen, wave to cheering crowds as they drive'from Oslo Cathedral\nto the royal castle after their wedding last Thursday.\nCrown Princc Frederick of Denmark, was asked to become king of the newly independent Norway. He agreed on condition that the people showed their approval of this choice by referendum. They voted for him by 259,563 votes to 69,264.\nPrincess May (later Queen Mary of England) wrote to an aunt of this royal election, \"The whole thing seems curious, but we live in very modern\ntimes\".\nPrince Carl changed his name to King Haakon VII and embarked on a reign which was to last 50 years. Because the present Norwegian royal family is\nidentified with Norway's achievement of independ- ence, Norwegians mostly have regarded their mon- archy in a favourable light.\nIt was, however, during World War II that King Haakon became the symboJ of national unity. After fleeing to England with the rightful Norwe- gian government, he said he would rather \"renounce the throne of Norway for himself and his house\" than give his approval to the appointment of Viktin Quisling as Prime Minister of Norway under the Ger- man Occupation.\nThe people of Norway had had no voice in such an appointment, he said. The $34.25 million which\nhe and his Government took with them from the Norwegian Treasury went towards opposing the\nGermans.\nAs in the rest of Scandi- navia, there are some people who feel that mon- archy is an anachronism in a modern democracy— but they seem to be in a minority. With the other Scandinavian countries, the Norwegians share a tradition of democratic monarchy which stretches back 10 centuries to when the Viking kings and free- men first worked out to- gether their respective roles in the State.\nThe socialist Working Party expressed cool ap- proval of the concept of\npresent-day monarchy as long ago as 1927: \"We can probably agree that it is possible to govern just as well with a king as with a president. There is no reason to run after a bourgeois republic\".\nOslo, the stronghold of the Norwegian socialiists, planned — with only two dissenting voices — to spend about $64,000 on decorating the capital's streets for the royal wed- ding. Judging by the rap- turous welcome which young people and students gave the news of the princc's wedding, young love's triumph over proto- col has made Norway's royal family more rather than less popular.\nArticle identifier\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131668982\nPage identifier\nhttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page14534349\nAPA citation\nTHREE PAGES FOR WOMEN NORWAY celebrated lust Thursday the marriage of its Crown Prince to a comprotocol moner.
