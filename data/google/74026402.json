(Center, wearing camouflage), inside the Capitol in Washington on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2021. After President Donald Trump urged supporters not to stand for his election defeat, crowds of angry partisans stormed the Capitol, putting a halt to the congressional acceptance of the election and bringing a violent end to his presidency.\nBy Elise Schmelzer | eschmelzer@denverpost.com | The Denver PostJanuary 24, 2021 at 6:00 a.m.Before Robert Gieswein donned goggles, grabbed a baseball bat and stormed the U.S. Capitol, he posed for photos across Colorado flashing a hand sign associated with an extremist militia ideology that he and hundreds of other Coloradans buy into.\nThe far-right militia movement has gained visibility in Colorado over the past year after its members appeared at protests across the state.\nMen wearing patches for the Three Percenter movement as well as identifiers of other far-right groups appeared at Black Lives Matter protests in Denver last summer. Dozens of men in military-style gear provided security for a Jan. 6 rally at the Colorado Capitol for people who falsely believe President Donald Trump won the 2020 election.\nIn 2019, Three Percenter militia members guarded a rally against Colorado‚Äôs red flag law where state lawmakers spoke. And political candidates have aligned themselves with militias, including newly-elected U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, who declared, ‚ÄúI am the militia.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIn last year we have seen a rise of the paramilitary movement in a way that is much more aggressive that what we‚Äôd seen in Colorado previously,‚Äù said Eric Ward, executive director of the Western States Center, which works to address white nationalism and other extremism in the American West.\nBut militias are not new to Colorado. A 1994 Anti-Defamation League report on militias in the state said several were operating along the Front Range, including in Lakewood, Boulder and Fort Collins. Some of the report echoes current trends in militias and noted that one group was selling a videotape called ‚ÄúThe New World Order, Communist groups supported by Hillary Clinton.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs hard to know how many people are involved in far-right militias in Colorado. Thousands have joined social media groups for Three Percenters in Colorado, though it‚Äôs unclear how many of those people do more than post online. One extremist expert put the number of people affiliated with the militia movement across the country at ‚Äútens of thousands.‚Äù\nLast year brought a perfect storm of conditions for militias to thrive, extremism experts said. The COVID-19 pandemic led to government-imposed restrictions, which play into far-right conspiracies. Misinformation swirled and was amplified by government officials, including Trump. People became more anxious and isolated.\nFederal agents investigating the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6 now have focused attention on far-right extremist groups, including the Three Percenters and the Oath Keepers, another anti-government militia, according to comments made Michael Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, after filing criminal charges against Gieswein and others.\n‚Äú2020 was really just the perfect breeding ground,‚Äù said Rachel Nielsen, executive director of the Colorado Resilience Collaborative, which combats targeted violence and extremism. ‚ÄúAdd into it a president who was cheering (extremism) on and misinformation, we have things like QAnon spring up, which is delusional.‚Äù\nErin Schaff, The New York TimesThe mob incited by President Donald Trump storms the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 6, 2021.\nOrganizing online\nOnline chat boards for militia members show a few groups across Colorado recruiting as well as dozens of people looking for groups to join. There is no unified, specific purpose among the groups and posters, some of whom advocate violence.\nThe Three Percenter movement ‚Äì the ideology Gieswein allegedly identified with ‚Äì is one of the more prominent militia movements in Colorado and across the country. Three Percenters see themselves as defenders of the country against government tyranny ‚Äì especially gun regulations ‚Äî and the Anti-Defamation League describes them as far-right, antigovernmental extremists.\n‚ÄúA pithy way to describe the militia movement is libertarianism plus guns plus conspiracies,‚Äù said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League and an expert on extremism.\nThere are thousands of people who identify with the militia ideology but may not join a group or take part in any activities beyond the Internet, he said. The emergence of the Three Percenter concept in 2008 allowed people to claim part of the militia movement without having to do anything, Pitcavage said. It was an easy-to-digest version of the militia ideology ‚Äî though it is based on the inaccurate portrayal of the American Revolution.\n‚ÄúAs a concept, anybody could declare themselves a Three Percenter,‚Äù he said.\nIf formed, militia groups are fairly small, comprised of between eight and 24 men, and are located in rural, suburban and urban areas, Pitcavage said.\nSome Colorado groups have online applications to fill out. One Three Percenter group‚Äôs application includes questions like whether the applicant has worked in the military or law enforcement, whether they can legally own a gun and why they want to join. Several groups explicitly state they are not racist or anti-Semitic and do not condone illegal acts.\n‚ÄúIf you are training and participating in paramilitary exercises in order to overthrow a democracy or a government that is transparent and accountable, that is political extremism,‚Äù Ward said. ‚ÄúIf you are training to use violence in order to drive policy decisions and how democracy works, that is political extremism as well.‚Äù\nMark Peterson, The New York TimesA man later identified as Robert Gieswein, left, stands near other members of the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol and was met with tear gas on Jan. 6, 2021. (Mark Peterson/The New York Times)\n‚ÄúAt the end of the day the outcome is violence‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs not exactly clear what many Colorado groups‚Äô immediate goals are, however.\nOne man posted in a chat board claiming to be an Oath Keeper and wanting to form a militia group on the Western Slope. In an interview with The Denver Post, he cited the need for a militia because of the threat of ‚Äúantifa‚Äù and the government, but said he wasn‚Äôt sure what the group‚Äôs goals would be if he formed one.\n‚ÄúI have no idea,‚Äù he said, declining to give his name.\nIt‚Äôs unclear how organized Gieswein‚Äôs alleged paramilitary training group, the Woodland Wild Dogs, was before his arrest.\n‚ÄúNever heard of it,‚Äù Teller County sheriff‚Äôs Cmdr. Greg Couch said of the group.\nGieswein had been seen at various community events carrying a rifle, but never acted in a threatening manner, Couch said.\nStephen Hall, a reporter at the Ark Valley Voice, a news outlet covering central Colorado, started researching local militia groups earlier last year. In one of the Colorado Three Percenter Facebook groups he monitored, which has since been deleted, people posted anti-Semitic messages as well as threats of violence to ‚Äúleftys‚Äù and government officials. Hall watched as the posts in the groups becoming more dangerous as racial justice protests continued across the country.\n‚ÄúTheir rhetoric started getting way more violent, their threats started getting more violent,‚Äù Hall said.\nPhotos showed Three Percenter groups running exercises at the Chaffee County public gun range. But the broader community in Chaffee County has not done much about the groups, Hall said, and he doesn‚Äôt think the lack of resistance is unique to his area.\n‚ÄúThe apathy toward this is systemic and problematic in any community, particularly in our state,‚Äù he said.\nBrendan Smialowski, AFP via Getty ImagesTrump supporters clash with police and security forces as they storm the US Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021. Thousands of Trump supporters, fueled by his spurious claims of voter fraud, flooded the nation‚Äôs capital protesting the expected certification of Joe Biden‚Äôs White House victory by the US Congress.\nTough conversations\nThe reasons people join militia groups vary, experts say. Some people are looking for a sense of belonging. Others might be feeling anxious about a perceived lack of power as other demographics begin to make up for decades of exclusion. Some may join a militia group to learn survival or self-defense tactics but soon become drawn into the conspiracies and more dangerous purposes, Ward said.\nBut the reason a person joins a militia is less important than the effect of their joining, which gives credence and power to the movement as a whole, Ward said.\nRelated Articles\nCrime and Public Safety |\nColorado man accused of entering Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs office on Jan. 6 sentenced to 3 years of probation\nCrime and Public Safety |\nHere‚Äôs who will be on Colorado‚Äôs presidential primary ballots ‚Äî and where Donald Trump stands\nCrime and Public Safety |\nLetters: The Colorado ruling ‚Äî Is Trump a threat to Democracy or isn‚Äôt he?\nCrime and Public Safety |\nColorado‚Äôs Trump ruling sets off political firestorm, raising legal stakes and putting state at center of debate\nPolicies\nReport an Error\nContact Us\nSubmit a News Tip\nMost PopularMost PopularNuggets‚Äô Michael Malone: Steve Kerr shared message for Nikola Jokic from late Warriors assistant coach Dejan MilojevicNuggets' Michael Malone: Steve Kerr shared message for Nikola Jokic from late Warriors assistant coach Dejan MilojevicOuray Plaindealer newspapers stolen on day it publishes story with allegations of rape at police chief‚Äôs houseOuray Plaindealer newspapers stolen on day it publishes story with allegations of rape at police chief's houseAsk Amy: After years of separation, spouse wants to reconcileAsk Amy: After years of separation, spouse wants to reconcileColorado board blocked Douglas County from lowering property taxes.

Kleinfeld notes that ‚Äúviolence (that day), first used as a political tool and now partially mainstreamed, has spread. The events on January 6 are not past. They are prelude.‚Äù\nShe explains:\n‚ÄúAs a researcher on violence and democracy around the world, I have studied party-linked militia groups for years. In countries like Iraq, Nigeria, Lebanon, and Colombia, politicians outsource violence to specialists in the trade, just as they hire consultants for robocalls and direct mail. In the past, googling these terms brought up countries just escaping from conflict or descending into it. Now, the United States, where militias have been embraced by GOP leaders at the national, state, and local level ‚Ä¶ appears among the early search results.‚Äù\nShe provides numerous stories from all over the country. She cites only one example from our state: an article from the Colorado Springs Independent about the El Paso County Republicans using United American Defense Force (UADF), the armed wing of conservative political group FEC United, standing for ‚ÄúFaith, Education and Commerce.‚Äù\nFEC United was created by a 48-year-old Douglas County businessman Joe Oltmann who owns a gun shop, a car repair outfit and a data marketing firm. In 2020, he organized protests against COVID-19 restrictions. He then was involved in pro-police rallies in opposition to Black Lives Matter protests.\nHe became nationally famous in rightwing circles six days after the 2020 election when he claimed on his Conservative Daily podcast that he had infiltrated an ‚ÄúAntifa conference call‚Äù and heard someone he identified as Eric Coomer say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about the election, Trump is not gonna win. I made fucking sure of that. Hahahaha.‚Äù Coomer was an employee of the Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems. Oltmann went on to claim that Dominion Voting Systems, Coomer and Antifa took part in a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.\nCoomer sued Oltmann, FEC United and more than a dozen individuals and organizations for defamation. The defendants tried to get the case dismissed, but Judge Marie Avery Moses of the Denver District Court ruled in May that the lawsuit can proceed to trial. In the 136-page ruling, Moses said evidence presented in the case shows that the defendants engaged in ‚Äúthe deliberate spread of dangerous and inflammatory political disinformation designed to sow distrust in democratic institutions.‚Äù Oltmann has never produced any evidence or answered any key questions about the alleged call, the judge said. The defendants include the Trump presidential campaign, Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani, One America News Network, The Gateway Pundit and Colorado Springs commentator Michelle Malkin.\nOltmann hasn‚Äôt been a marginal figure in the Colorado GOP. The current state Republican Party Chair Kristi Burton Brown served as FEC United‚Äôs president, and Oltmann himself was briefly nominated for governor at the GOP‚Äôs state assembly last spring.\nOltmann has a blood-thirsty obsession with executing political opponents and ‚Äúforetells a dark future when violence will be necessary,‚Äù according to a review of his rhetoric by Washington Post reporter Rosalind S. Helderman.\nOn his podcast last December, Oltmann was enraged that 19 Senate Republicans voted with Democrats to approve an 11-week stopgap spending bill. This was in conflict with a far right demand for a government shutdown to stop federal vaccine mandates for employers.\nIn response, Oltmann said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs your list of 19 traitors to the American people, along with all the other traitors to the American people. I want people to go out there and get some wood. The gallows are getting wider and longer. We should be able to build gallows all the way from Washington, D.C., to California.‚Äù\nLater in the broadcast, he called Gov. Jared Polis a traitor and a liar. He said the governor should be lynched.\nColorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has been persistently denounced by Oltmann. She decided to travel with a security detail. ‚ÄúAny person, when they see an election denier group with a militia arm call for them to be hanged, would take that extremely seriously,‚Äù she told the Washington Post.\n***\nThis opinion column does not necessarily reflect the views of Boulder Weekly.\nEmail: editorial@boulderweekly.com\nTAGScover3jul 21 2022 issue\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp\nPrevious articleLibraries are the frontlines of democracy.

If no crime happens, that‚Äôs a successful shift.‚Äù\nThe best practices also include advice to stay 50 feet from the ballot box.\nBut there‚Äôs no suggestion that FEC members should not openly carry guns to the ballot-box events.

Today, some may believe the militia to be a group of young Black men united for the purpose of militantly defending the Black community from white incursions. Historically, it has been perceived as a defense force protecting Black people. It also has been envisioned by some as the substitute for a white-dominated local police force policing all-Black communities‚Äîa militia self-trained in firearm use, serving as a community resource ready to keep the Black community secure while being in and of the community.\nThis idealized image and set of assumptions are what sometimes define interactions with a public audience when I discuss my research on late nineteenth-century Southern Black militiamen. Some also asked how my scholarship might inform and help restore modern-day Black hopes of communal integrity (through armed self-defense by Black men and women) against white supremacy. Often their questions remind me of the classic Civil Rights and Black Power works by Robert F. Williams and Lance Hill.\nDuring the Civil War, the United States government invited Black men to become citizen-soldiers to defend the U.S. This war was perhaps the one time, aside from the Revolutionary War, when the nation empowered Black men with guns. However, this moment of national defense raised questions of gender, access to weapons, the significance of voting rights earned on the battlefield, and Black citizenship. Historians including Carole Emberton, Tera W. Hunter, Edythe Ann Quinn, and Holly Pinheiro, Jr. debate the costs of war, freedom, and Black life in the U. S.\nThe post-Civil War world challenged notions of gender and the nation that tested the resiliency of American institutions. It was within this nexus of postbellum change that Southern African Americans endeavored to carve out a place for themselves not only within the national community of U. S. citizens, but within the Southern state where they challenged both racial and gender discrimination. Black people in the nineteenth century used the militia to organize as they made efforts to claim U.S. citizenship.\nBlack militia service has a long history in the Americas. State-sponsored militia in the eighteenth century provided men of African descent access to state institutions, white leadership, and an opportunity to participate in public institutional functions. Black militiamen serving in the state-sponsored militia units were sometimes soldiers who participated in combat fighting for the colonial state in defense of the Colony. For example, Jaime Feliciano Gonzalez was born in bondage in Montevideo in 1820; by 1843, he served in an artillery unit and nine years later (in 1852) he rose to an artillery officer‚Äîand engaged in the watershed Argentine Battle of Caseros.\nThree years later, Gonzalez expressed an interest in the political realm and he held active membership in Uruguay‚Äôs Colorado Party. His military and political careers continued into the 1870s: he served in the Buenos Aires army, the overthrow of the Uruguayan president and in combat service in Paraguay‚Äôs War of the Triple Alliance, 1864-1870. Afro-Uruguayan men nominated Gonzalez in 1872 for a seat in the House of Representatives. By 1890, the freedman was recognized as ‚ÄúUruguay‚Äôs first known colonel of African descent.‚Äù\nWhite Colonial North Americans used Black bodies to defend Georgia and South Carolina with the caveat of occasional rewards recognizing Black militia service with land, the right to vote, or occasional freedom. Black militia service did not lead to an open invitation of belonging, citizenship, or a seat at the table of nation-state formation in contrast to some Afro-Latin moments of militia service. By 1792, ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs army,‚Äù the militia populated by the citizen-soldier, would be racially legislated in the U. S. as white men only reflecting the contract between the state and white male liberty. The U.S. existed as an agreement where the nation protected personal property‚Äîincluding slaves and white notions of liberty‚Äîin exchange for white defense of the national and state governments from foreign invasion. State and national defense was the singular responsibility of white male, citizen soldiers.\nIn response, Jeffery Kerr Ritchie‚Äôs work on antebellum African American militiamen has proven that Black men did seek to organize state militias in the North. Rhode Island, an exception in this story, in the 1840s, mobilized its Black companies to put down a white working-class insurrection. Twenty years earlier, the state disfranchised Blacks. As a reward for the Black units‚Äô 1840 defense service African American voting rights were restored. North of the border, Black Canadians served the state defending provincial governments and the British empire‚Äôs imperial needs that included putting down the William Lyon Mackenzie rebellion for Canadian independence, constructing a road, and peacekeeping between Catholic and Protestant workers constructing the Welland Canal, 1837-1850. The Canadian government disbanded these Black militia units in 1850.\nBy the antebellum era, Northern African Americans were less successful in organizing all-Black militia companies. White state officials opposed arming African Americans with state power and guns. Nevertheless, Ritchie noted Black militia organizations near the end of the antebellum era organized in the U. S. as a response to slavery. Black militiamen armed themselves hoping to confront and destroy the peculiar institution on the eve of the Civil War. Yet, Black service was rejected both before and during the Civil War. As a result, some Black people debated whether the war needed African American bodies to fight a war among whites, North and South. The antebellum U.S. white traditions minimized the militia‚Äôs political advocacy for Black people, except in public parades in exchange for armed African Americans providing service to the state as a defender of state governance against white violence.\nSouthern Black access to militia formation was part of the postwar nation-building process in some states. Black militia formation focused less on military defense in lieu of providing political power to Black communities. Georgia is a case study of that process defining rural and urban African American aspirations for the militia. Rural Black Americans used the militia to defend their political and economic autonomy. Urban all-Black state-funded units proved that African Americans had advanced beyond bondage. This dichotomy, rural Black controlled independent and urban all-Black state militia units, defined postbellum Georgia‚Äôs Black militiamen for decades until after the Spanish-American War.\nThe world of Black militiamen needs further exploration. Did Black U.S. Army veterans become militiamen and combine their combat training with political skills since the postbellum militia for people of African descent was part of the overall Black search for freedom, belonging, claims-making, and citizenship? Scholarly research is predominantly focused on manhood and military service. What role have women played in militia formation, operation, and public celebrations of Blackness?\nWhat is clear is that from the colonial era in the Americas to the end of the nineteenth-century, the African descendant militiaman was a combat soldier in some parts of the Americas‚Äîand hoped to parlay wartime service into peacetime individual and collective political rights . The post-Civil War Black militiaman was more a political and economic advocate hoping to secure freedom, citizenship, and belonging in a transforming United States.\nShare with a friend:Copyright ¬© AAIHS.
