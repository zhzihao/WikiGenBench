This custom of wearing white clothes earned the Korean a nickname that can be described with a four characer word:\n백의민족 ~ white clothes people\nThis in turn comes from a four character hanja word:\n白衣民族\nLet’s look more closely at the individual characters:\n白 (meaning: 횐, pronunciation: 백) ~ white\n衣 (meaning: 옷, pronunciation: 의) ~ clothes\n民 (meaning: 백성, pronunciation: 민) ~ people. Literally “100 last names”\n族 (meaning: 겨레, pronunciation: 족) ~ offspring of the same forefather, related by blood\nThe last two characters might seem a bit odd for most Westeners, but here comes my own, personal, home-made interpretation:\nFirst let’s look at some statistics about Korean last names:\nMore than 1 in 5 is named Kim! More specifically 21.5% of the Korean population is named Kim.\nThe Lees follow suit with 14.7%\nPark accounts for 8.4%\nThe Jungs count 4.8%\nClosely followed by Choi at 4.7%\nLast among the most popular last names we find Cho counting 2.9% of the population.\nThat means that only five last names account for some whopping 57 percent of the Korean population!\n(source)\nIt also means that if you line up people with the top 100 last names you are likely to have accouted for pretty siginificant fraction of the population.\nConsidering that so many of people share last name, it makes sense that a Kim is not just a Kim, and not all Kims are related. There are different blood lines of Kims, Lees, and Jungs etc. Each line of Kim decending from a particular Kim is considered a “clan” of it’s own.\nSome names have enjoyed higher status than others and like some British titles, family names have been traded among people in need of cash in return for status. Nevertheless, since a very large fraction of the Korean population shares last names, the total number of common last names really isn’t that big – especially considering the size of the country and its population.\nFun fact:\nUntil 1997 it was prohibited to marry someone from the same clan. Since each clan counts quite a few people, that ruled out quite a few potential couples that weren’t actually closely related. The particular legal article lost its effect in 1997, but it was only removed from the Korean civil code in 2005 when the law was revised. Nowadays the opportunity to marry someone sharing your clan name is based on how closely related you actually are rather than the fact that you shared an ancestor back in the ancient days.\nTo not get into the legal issues of marriage in present day Korea, let’s return to the hanja:\nIf you bring together all of the clans (all the last names), you have “a people”!\nI don’t know if this has any relation to how the term actually came to exist, but this is how I made sense of it when I heard it 🙂 I hope it will also help you remember this four-character hanja 🙂\nRelated\nFollow\nLooking for a particular post? try searching for it\nCategories\nArchive\nTOPIK - IntermediateOctober 17, 2015The big day is here.30th TOPIKApril 20, 2013The big day is here.Awards\nCookie Policy\nComment\nReblog\nSubscribe\nSubscribed\nkoreanstudentblog\nJoin 265 other subscribers\nkoreanstudentblog\nCustomize\nSubscribe\nSubscribed\nSign up\nLog in\nCopy shortlink\nReport this content\nView post in Reader\nManage subscriptions\nCollapse this bar\n%d"

The purpose of this work is to study the expression of resistance in the white Hanbok in modern culture, specifically after the 1980s. Koreans have traditionally revered white color and enjoyed wearing white clothes. In Korea, white represents simplicity, asceticism, sadness, resistance against corruption, and the pursuit of innocence. This paper looks at: (i) the universal and traditional values of the color white, (ii) the significance of traditional white Korean clothing, (iii) the resistance characteristics of white in traditional Korean clothes, and (iv) the aesthetic values of white Hanbok. The white Hanbok often connotes resistance when it is worn in modern Korea. It is worn in folk plays, worn by shamans as a shamanist costume, worn by protestors for anti-establishment movements, and worn by social activists or progressive politicians. The fact that the white Hanbok has lost its position as an everyday dress in South Korea (instead symbolizing resistance when it is worn) is an unusual phenomenon. It shows that the white Hanbok, as a type of costume, is being used as a strong means of expression, following a change in the value of traditional costumes as it take on an expressive function.

Este color, o no-color, en la cultura occidental, sirve de símbolo de pureza, limpieza y eternidad. En cambio, en Corea, el blanco lleva implícito el concepto de vacío, ejemplificando, en muchas ocasiones, el aspecto trascendental y la muerte (Seo, 2015). Como se explica al final del video, muchas de las construcciones megalíticas, emplazadas como lugares funerarios, eran recubiertas de cuarzo blanco. ...Translations, un poema audiovisual.Conference PaperFull-text availableOct 2021 Ji Yeon Kim Ángel Manuel Rodríguez AriasTranslation, en inglés, es un término que define, por una parte, el acto de traducir de un idioma a otro, y por otra, el de trasladar de un lugar a otro. Urdiendo un juego con el doble sentido de esta expresión, la síntesis de este ensayo audiovisual se basa dentro de una dinámica introspectiva, en definir el vínculo entre dos culturas, y dos lugares; Galicia y Corea, a través de una mirada íntima en la que se resarza al sujeto subalterno.Partiendo del constructo Oriente-Occidente, como explica Edward Saíd, el primero es visto como un amalgama en el que lo místico y lo exótico se observan con deseo, siempre desde una posición superior. El término se trata en sí mismo de una forma de reafirmarse a sí mismo; al hombre, blanco, europeo, cristiano y endocéntrico, frente al resto.En consecuencia, tomando estos conceptos como una forma de comprender la propia identidad subjetiva de una mujer migrante, la estructura de esta experimentación se basa en una serie de intervenciones en el paisaje, en distintos territorios. De este modo, una estructura portátil y desmontable es colocada en un bosque, un arroyo o un lago. Estos espacios, esconden lugares en los que las personas se asentaron antaño, pero hoy permanecen olvidados. El color blanco y sus significaciones en el folclore de ambas culturas; pureza, vida, fragilidad o muerte, servirán, en definitiva, de elemento vertebrador que da sentido a la secuencia de imágenes y sonidos, las cuales se interrelacionan a través de este análisis comparativo.ViewShow abstractThe white-clad people: The white hanbok and Korean nationalismArticleAug 2022Cult DynamYeseung LeeThe paper diachronically examines the white hanbok as the material and symbolic site of interaction between the hegemonising and the hegemonised in Korea. It traces the changing status of the white hanbok from the end of the 19th century to the present—from being part of unconscious material culture, to the synecdoche of the colonised nation, to the symbol of resistance, to the membrane of a ‘homogeneous nation’, to the symbol of democracy. It analyses the white hanbok as a paradoxical skin—at once inclusive and exclusive—of Korean ethnonationalism, as well as a permeable membrane between the self and other of national identity. By exploring the white hanbok in relation to the ongoing movement towards a decolonised democratic nation, the paper reveals the entwined relations between material objects, practices, and nationalism in Korea.ViewShow abstractThe Truck of Doom as an instrument of fate: Characteristic features of plot construction in South Korean TV seriesArticleJan 2020Alexandra TarasovaViewWitnessing Queer Flights: Josué Azor’s Lougawou Images and Antihomosexual Unrest in HaitiChapterJan 2020Mario LamotheViewSo Far Down You Can’t See the Light: Afro-Fabulation in Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s An OctoroonChapterJan 2020Tavia Nyong’oViewThe Performance and Politics of Concurrent Temporalities in George C.

He was the first Professor of Anthropology at the University of Oxford from 1896 to 1909, and developed a broad definition of culture which is still used by scholars. First published in 1871, this classic work explains Tylor's idea of cultural evolution in relation to anthropology, a social theory which states that human cultures invariably change over time to become more complex. Unlike his contemporaries, Tylor did not link biological evolution to cultural evolution, asserting that all human minds are the same irrespective of a society's state of evolution. His book was extremely influential in popularising the study of anthropology and establishing cultural evolution as the main theoretical framework followed by anthropologists in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Volume 2 contains Tylor's interpretation of animism in society.ViewShow abstractFashion as CommunicationArticleJan 1998Susan B.

Seoul:\nNadeulmok.A study on the Korean psychology of color based on achromatic colorJan 19985Lee백의고 historians regarding the background of this Baekeuihosang(白衣好尙, the preference for white clothing) tradition and even now, it is frequently being discussed. This study aims to consider and discuss the background of this Baekeuihosang tradition, focusing on Chang-seon Yoo's Baekeuigo(白衣考, the consideration of white clothing), which was published in Dong-A Ilbo in 1934. The purposes of studying literature such as the Baekeuigo is to analyze the arguments on the origin of Baekeuihosang, to analyze Chang-seon Yoo's claim of its origin, and to discuss the culture of Baekeuihosang. Chang-seon Yoo claimed that the existing discussions on the background of Baekeuihosang based on the lack of dyes, or undeveloped technique, economic privation and national control strayed from historical facts, according to literature review. It is not worth discussing the farfetched arguments such as the use of costumes for ancestral rites as everyday wears, or the nation of sorrow. Baekeuihosang tradition mostly originated from the effects of many religions and the taste for innocence, or naturalness. White clothes were infused with the sorrow and emotion of Korean people and were also worn to show resistance to foreign power as symbols of ethnicity. Therefore, there should be a new view of the discussion of white clothes and Korean aesthetic sense, away from the logic distorted by the Japanese colonial view of history.Read moreInterested in research on European Continental Ancestry Group?Join ResearchGate to discover and stay up-to-date with the latest research from leading experts in European Continental Ancestry Group and many other scientific topics.Join for free ResearchGate iOS AppGet it from the App Store now.InstallKeep up with your stats and moreAccess scientific knowledge from anywhere orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
