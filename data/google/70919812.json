And improving safety for vulnerable users is an essential component of transportation equity because accidents and fatalities are not evenly distributed.13 Research shows that poverty is a significant risk factor for pedestrian fatalities.14 Nonmotorized transportation is often seen as something for children or merely a weekend recreational activity. This view misses the reality that more than 10.3 million households, or 8.5 percent of occupied housing units, lack access to a vehicle, and another 39 million have only one vehicle.15 For these households, biking, walking, and public transportation—which requires people to walk at the start and end of every journey—are essential means of commuting to work and meeting other daily needs. Yet the transportation system all too often fails these users either by design or by neglect. According to research by the Federal Highway Administration:\nesigning streets with these users in mind—sidewalks, raised medians, turning access controls, better bus stop placement, better light­ing, traffic calming measures, accessible sidewalks, curb cut outs, accessible signage for sensory and cognitive disabilities, and other advances for travelers with disabili­ties—improves pedestrian, bicyclist, and motorist safety.16\nIn short, DOT should prioritize improving safety for the most vulnerable roadway users, including pedestrians, cyclists, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Additionally, the department has broad authority to improve: 1) infrastructure facility design and operations; 2) vehicle design, including advanced onboard safety technology; and 3) commercial carrier operations. The following are specific steps that DOT leadership should take to improve safety as well as new policy proposals.\nExisting rules, guidance, and directives\nEighty-fifth percentile rule: Speeding is the primary cause of roughly one-third of all motor vehicle fatalities and a contributing factor in many more.17 Lowering vehicle speed reduces both the frequency and severity of crashes and injuries.18 The Federal Highway Administration provides technical standards and guidance on how to design and control vehicle movements with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD), which is incorporated by reference with U.S. Code Title 23, Section 109(d), Code of Federal Regulations, Part 655.603. While states retain the final authority to set speeds, the MUTCD is a foundational text for the civil engineering profession. The MUTCD provides states with the following speed limit guidance: “When a speed limit within a speed zone is posted, it should be within 5 mph of the 85th-percentile speed of free-flowing traffic.”19 Importantly, this guidance is based on driver preference as opposed to safety and roadway context. According to the Texas DOT, the 85th percentile rule responds to drivers’ “desire to reach their destination in the shortest possible time.”20 Yet the fact that most drivers will hit a certain speed is not a sound basis for setting speed limits. The 85th percentile rule is especially dangerous in areas with pedestrians, cyclists, and other nonmotorized users. The Federal Highway Administration should amend the MUTCD to strike the 85th percentile rule and replace it with guidance that prioritizes roadway user safety with a special focus on nonmotorized users over the travel-time desire of drivers.\nLevel of service: Under U.S. Code Title 23, Section 109, the secretary of transportation has incorporated by reference the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials’ “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.” The guide prioritizes designing roadways around a “level of service,” which is a qualitative and subjective design concept that “characterizes the operating conditions on the facility in terms of traffic performance measures related to speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.”21 The guide states that “designers should strive to provide the highest level of service practical.”22 The goal of transportation investments cannot simply be to increase vehicle speeds. The design choices that maximize vehicle level of service undermine nonmotorized access and safety. To the greatest extent possible, surface transportation performance should measure people—not vehicles. For instance, person throughput is a much more accurate and valuable measure of roadway productivity than vehicle counts or vehicle level of service. This distinction is especially important in metropolitan regions. A facility designed to support all users will increase person throughput while slightly decreasing vehicle speeds. The result is increased roadway safety and productivity. The secretary should adopt guidance that clarifies that planners should prioritize designing facilities around people.\nHours of service (RIN 2126-AC19): The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration proposes to provide commercial drivers “greater flexibility” with federal hours-of-service (HOS) requirements. The federal government regulates commercial vehicle operations and rest periods to promote roadway safety. Research shows that driver fatigue results in slower response times, attention failures, and poor decision-making.23 The proposed rule would weaken HOS standards, increasing the likelihood of dangerous driver fatigue. For instance, it would extend the maximum duty period for certain commercial drivers from 12 hours to 14 hours.24 This and other changes are being promoted under the banner of “efficiency”—not safety or sound science. The HOS changes should be repealed.\nSpeed limiting devices (RIN 2126-AB63): The proposed rule would require vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiting device. According to research by the federal government, each year, there are more than 1,000 fatalities from crashes involving heavy-duty vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of more than 26,000 pounds. The proposed rule would decrease annual fatalities involving heavy-duty trucks by more than 200 and major injuries by more than 4,600.25 All heavy trucks have these devices installed, but they are not necessarily activated. The proposed rule has been published and the comment period completed. The speed limiting rules should be promulgated.\nPassenger locomotive recorders (RIN 2130-AC5): The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act requires the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to promulgate a rule to require all intercity and commuter rail providers to install one inward and one outward video-recording device in each locomotive. The recorders would provide invaluable data to support crash investigations and best practices for rail operations. The FRA published a notice of proposed rule-making in November 2018 but has not completed a final rule. The locomotive recorder rule should be promulgated.\nPositive train control: This technology prevents “train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits, and movements of trains through switches in the wrong position.”26 Originally, Congress mandated all freight and passenger railroads implement this technology by December 31, 2015. The current deadline is December 31, 2020. This should not be extended—even given work disruptions due to the coronavirus. Fully implementing positive train control would save carriers an estimated $4 billion and result in roughly 40 fewer significant accidents involving freight or passenger railroads each year.27\nNew rules and guidance\nReducing emissions and adapting to climate change\nIn the United States, aircrafts and on-road vehicles emit more than 1.73 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year.36 If these planes and vehicles were a country, they would be the fourth-largest emitter on Earth.37 Achieving substantial emissions reductions in the coming years, the Department of Transportation must push for a combination of emissions-control regulations and changes to the built environment that reduce the need to drive. Contrary to historical logic, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) growth is not necessary to sustain robust and inclusive gross domestic product growth. In fact, data from the U.S. Department of Energy shows that economic growth began to decouple from driving around the year 2000.38 To avoid the worst effects of climate change, the United States must adopt aggressive policies to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from the mobile sector by 2050. The following steps would help put the U.S. transportation sector on this path.\nExisting rules, guidance, and directives\nCAFE standards: In August 2012, the Obama administration finalized a historic agreement to increase vehicle fuel efficiency standards to 54 1/2 miles per gallon by model year 2025.39 In March 2020, however, the Trump administration promulgated a new rule that substantially weakens light-duty vehicle emissions standards, known as the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard.40 The new rule would reduce fuel efficiency by 27 percent, resulting in more than 80 billion additional gallons of gasoline consumed by the vehicles produced during the period covered by the rule.41 This rule should be repealed and a new CAFE standard set, based on climate science and the rapid pace of technological advancement in the light-duty vehicle sector.\nClimate preparedness: Executive order 13653, “Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change,” should be reinstated, along with Federal Highway Administration order 5520. Taken together, these orders would help to “to develop, prioritize, implement and evaluate risk-based and cost-effective strategies to minimize climate and extreme weather risks and protect critical infrastructure using the best available science, technology and information.”42\nNew rules\nNew policy\nAlleviating congestion\nThe early days of interstate construction unleashed large transportation efficiency gains—especially for trips between regions and for farm-to-market access. Yet continuing to add highway capacity to the current system is both expensive and a poor investment. Decades of research has shown that the phenomenon of induced demand means that new capacity provides temporary travel-time savings that are quickly washed away as drivers fill the space until delay returns to pre-construction levels.53\nFurthermore, ride-hailing and the emerging technology of autonomous vehicles will not solve the problem. Research shows that ride-hailing increases total VMT and congestion while reducing transit trips. Ride-hailing service drivers must deadhead, or travel without passengers, between fares, adding to regional VMT.54 Moreover, the same density that gives rise to transit demand is a rich source of customers, leading to a high volume of ride-hailing vehicles and short wait times. One study of New York City found that in 2016 alone, ride-hailing added 600 million miles of driving.55\nAutonomous vehicles will provide some operational improvements, including running at higher speeds with shorter clearance distances between vehicles. This improvement will provide a one-time bump, not an ever-increasing benefit. The vehicle throughput improvements on signalized roadways will be minimal. As stated in a previous Center for American Progress report:\nEven if autonomous vehicles could safely travel at 60 miles per hour on a signalized arterial, such an operational change would lead to jarring incongruity with the surrounding residential and commercial land uses. This would likely lead to speed limits on AVs that largely mirror current speed limits in cities, meaning that the capacity bump on signalized arterials is likely to be modest. And limited-access highways and signalized arterials are connected. No matter how many AVs a limited-access highway may be able to carry, those vehicles must eventually exit onto surface roadways.56\nWhen considering the potential of any new technology to alleviate congestion, it’s important to remember this maxim by transit consultant Jarrett Walker: “Technology never changes geometry.”57 Trying to push ever larger numbers of rolling metal boxes through constrained urban space is a losing proposition. Roadway pricing and providing people with affordable, safe, and sustainable alternatives to driving is the best approach to keep dynamic regions moving and growing.\nIn aviation, only a handful of airports are capacity constrained. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are 519 commercial-service airports with at least 2,500 passenger enplanements each year. Only 15 airports are capacity constrained, which is defined as sustained passenger demand at 85 percent or greater of airport capacity.58 In 2018, these 15 airports accounted for 92 percent of all passenger enplanements.59 Thus, aviation congestion is a problem affecting only a handful of major hub airports.\nExisting rules and guidance\nNew policy\nExpanding economic opportunity\nState departments of transportation overwhelmingly focus their attention and resources on maintaining and expanding the state highway network. Stated another way, state DOTs tend to care about the assets they own and not the ones they don’t. Yet this narrow focus often leads to project selection decisions that have marginal value for those regions facing the greatest economic hardship. State project selection decisions often diverge from the types of improvements that local leaders would prioritize if they had access to more transportation dollars. Increasing local control over project selection decisions involving federal funds is one important element of creating more equitable economic growth and opportunity.\nIn addition, increased local control over project planning and selection is critical to address the harmful and discriminatory history of transportation infrastructure. The interstate construction era is rife with examples of communities of color being leveled to make way for highways intended to reduce the travel times of largely white, middle-class suburban commuters.\nFor example, DOT sits roughly a half-mile from Interstate 695, which is more commonly known as the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, in Washington, D.C. Prior to construction, the surrounding neighborhood had roughly 24,000 residents, of which approximately 80 percent were Black.61 In order to make way for the modern residential housing and the highway facility, local and federal planners declared the long-standing neighborhood blighted and bulldozed numerous houses and businesses beginning in the 1950s.62 The resulting hardship on dislocated residents was lost as planners and elected officials engaged in self-congratulatory declarations of success. There are too many similar examples from the interstate era to count. Policy reform—including but not limited to more devolution of federal dollars to local authorities— is needed to redress these historic harms as well as to prevent future discriminatory project selection decisions.\nConstruction of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway, 1968. Photos courtesy of the District Department of Transportation\nGreater local control also helps to reduce state DOTs’ tendency to invest in costly highway boondoggles that provide little social, economic, and environmental return on investment. For instance, the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) recently completed the Portsmouth Bypass, or state Route 823, in Scioto County along the Ohio River. The $1.2 billion P3 project includes construction and 35 years of operations and maintenance.63 And while the new highway shaves off a few minutes of travel time, it fails to address the most pressing local infrastructure and economic development challenges, including crumbling legacy facilities, polluted brownfield parcels located on prime land along the Ohio River, and aging waterworks.\nTo put the cost of the bypass in perspective, it helps to compare it to ODOT’s plans for local spending in Scioto County in the coming years. ODOT plans to spend a total of $41.5 million in Scioto County over the next four years, or a little more than $10 million a year.64 Excluding long-term operations and maintenance, the cost for the bypass was $646 million.65 Thus, ODOT spent 15 times more constructing the bypass—which took four years—than it intends to spend in Scioto County over an equivalent period of time.66\nState DOTs care about the assets they own. Typically, this means the primary highway network. Yet this asset-based vision of investment is fundamentally flawed. Federal policy must change to recognize that travel-time savings are not the same as economic development. By pushing federal dollars and decision-making down to city and county officials, regions will be able to make more cost-effective and successful investments.\nNew policy\nLocal control: Increase the share of Surface Transportation Block Grant funds subject to suballocation to 75 percent. Suballocate at least 25 percent of National Highway Performance Program funds. This change would further empower local leaders to make project selection decisions, helping to move away from a highway-centric approach to mobility and toward a more balanced, and multimodal system.\nBoulevard pilot program: Establish a pilot program with $300 million annually to fund the removal or conversion of limited-access highways, viaducts, or other principal arterial facilities that are no longer justified by travel demand or that are out of context with surrounding land use and economic development plans.Removing access-controlled highways that have come to the end of their useful life is an effective strategy to return valuable urban land to productive use, reconnect neighborhoods divided by highway facilities, and improve local transportation service. Rochester, New York, has already successfully removed a larger share of its inner loop.67 In addition, the New York State DOT has recently chosen to remove the elevated portion of Interstate 81 in Syracuse.\nMain streets: Establish a new competitive grant program with $250 million annually that would provide funding for capital projects to help small towns and midsize communities improve their main streets and central business districts, including through reconstruction, traffic calming, adding and improving nonmotorized facilities, lighting, and other design elements.\nDestination access: Establish a new performance measure for destination access. As opposed to tracking vehicle speeds, metropolitan planning organizations should be required to measure the ability of the transportation system to affordably, safely, and sustainably connect people to jobs, housing, and essential services, including health care, child care, and education, among others.\nJobs-housing balance: Prioritize those transportation projects that help to reduce the imbalance in the location of workforce housing and employment centers. A combination of the suburbanization of many postindustrial jobs and the need for working and lower-income residents to live far away from employment opportunities to find affordable housing has created a structural imbalance in where people live and where they work. DOT should focus on transportation projects that support better land use and housing mix that allow people to live closer to where they work.68\nImproving the condition of existing infrastructure assets\nThe current approach to performance management and to the state of repair of surface transportation assets has two fundamental problems. First, states are permitted to set a declining state of good repair performance target. This means that states can affirmatively declare their intent to use federal funds in a way that will permit their system to further deteriorate over time. States should be required to set a performance target that calls for stable or improving asset conditions. Second, there is no meaningful penalty for failure to make progress on asset repair conditions. Federal highway dollars flow each and every year, even when states make project selection decisions that ensure the share of broken bridges and deteriorating pavement will increase. The following recommendations would strengthen the federal performance management framework as well as reduce state project selection discretion for federal formula programs until states achieved a state of good repair.\nExisting rules and guidance\nPerformance measures: Section 150 of U.S. Code Title 23 includes three performance measures related to asset condition, including the condition of pavement on the National Highway System and interstate system and the condition of bridges on the NHS.69 The existing measures for asset condition should be amended to require states to maintain or improve pavement and bridge conditions. This change is important because the level of system disrepair is highly divergent across states, and the current performance structure does nothing to push states to do better. For instance, Florida has 1,375 NHS bridges listed as being in fair or poor condition.70 By comparison, Pennsylvania has 4,064, despite having a nearly identical number of NHS bridges.71\nNew policy\nGuiding infrastructure prioritization, financing, and implementation\nTargeted hiring and high-road employment labor practices and procurement\nFederal infrastructure expenditures can create and sustain millions of well-paying jobs with strong benefits that allow families to own a home, send children to college or postsecondary training programs, and build retirement savings. For example, a worker making 150 percent of the federal minimum wage earns only $10.88 an hour, or $21,760 for a full year of work. By comparison, the average nonsupervisory heavy-construction worker earns $30.07, or $60,140 a year.86 This translates to an increase of $38,380, or 176 percent.87\nYet the benefits that come from construction and other infrastructure-related jobs have often bypassed women and communities of color due to discriminatory hiring practices. Moreover, even when infrastructure spending occurs in economically disadvantaged areas, it doesn’t translate into local jobs. This reality undermines the ability of infrastructure expenditures to deliver immediate benefits to struggling communities. DOT can begin to address this problem by using its authority to promote targeted hiring practices.\nImportantly, reforming bid processes to require targeted hiring is not sufficient to redress discrimination and other exclusionary practices. To make real progress, DOT must work closely with the U.S. Department of Labor to create pathways that help individuals gain the necessary skills and on-the-job training required to build a successful career as opposed to a one-off, short-term job. Expanding apprenticeship programs is one powerful tool to successfully bring people into the construction industry.\nNew rules and guidance\nTargeted hiring: Use the special experimental projects authority as part of a pilot program or promulgate a new rule allowing grant recipients and subrecipients to require geographic-based hiring preferences. Historically, federal regulations prohibited the use of such preferences under the theory that they could erode competition and lead to higher bid prices on infrastructure projects. In March 2015, the Obama administration began a rule-making process to allow for targeting hiring preferences.88 However, the Trump administration withdrew this proposed rule in 2017.89 DOT should develop a pilot program or resume the rule-making process and promote targeted hiring with formula and discretionary program funds.\nBest value contracting: Publish guidance that encourages state and local grant and financing recipients to engage in best value contracting, which scores bids based on price as well as other factors, including equity and “commitment to creating or sustaining high-quality job opportunities affiliated with registered apprenticeship programs.”90\nNew policy\nUnion neutrality: Prioritize competitive grant and financing program applications for those state and local governments whose contracting practices give preference to bidders that have formally adopted policies that are neutral toward matters of labor organizing.\nApprenticeships: Allow states and regions to use up to 3 percent of their formula or discretionary grant awards to support the establishment and continuation of registered apprenticeship programs for the construction industry.\nSmall and disadvantaged businesses: Increase the share of federal funds and financing assistance that must flow to small and disadvantaged businesses serving as contractors or subcontractors on infrastructure projects. DOT defines disadvantaged businesses as “for-profit small business concerns where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51% interest and also control management and daily business operations.”91\nAdditional resources on the structure and challenges of P3s\n“The Hazards of Noncompete Clauses in Public-Private Partnership Deals”92\n“The Limits of Risk Transference Through Public-Private Partnerships”93\n“Assessing Claims About Public-Private Partnerships”94\n“Public-Private Partnerships: Understanding the Difference Between Procurement and Finance”95\nProject finance\nThe municipal bond market is the principal mechanism by which state, local, and special-purpose governmental entities finance infrastructure projects. Approximately two-thirds of all infrastructure projects rely on municipal bond financing.96 According to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, there is more than $4.1 trillion in outstanding municipal issuances.97 In short, state and local project sponsors do not lack access to project financing. The constraint holding back additional infrastructure work is insufficient tax and user fee revenues to repay new project debts.\nThe deep economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic has only exacerbated this reality. For instance, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that total VMT fell by 40 percent, or 120 billion miles, in April 2020 compared with the same month during the previous year.98 This reduction in driving will decrease federal and state fuel tax collections by billions of dollars.99\nProponents of P3s often tout private financing as a solution. Yet swapping one source of financing for another doesn’t address the public sector revenue shortfall. Private financing—including bank debt, private activity bonds, and equity—must be repaid. Moreover, private sources of capital often come at a substantially higher cost. For instance, the current yield on 30-year municipal securities is 1.78 percent.100 By comparison, the target return on equity is greater than 10 percent.101 Using equity financing for infrastructure projects is like choosing to finance a house with a credit card instead of a mortgage.\nThe actual value proposition of P3s is not that they solve the revenue shortfall problem, but rather that they offer a mechanism for the government to transfer project delivery or revenue risk to a private concessionaire. In theory, the project sponsors determine that paying a premium for private financing is worth the added cost if it helps avoid cost overruns or the downside risk of toll revenue shortfalls. The project delivery record for P3s is decidedly mixed, and political factors often reduce the degree of real risk transference. For instance, the Interstate 4 Ultimate highway project in Orlando, Florida, and the Purple Line light rail project in Maryland are both P3 concessions with significant delays and cost overruns.102\nConclusion\nAbout the author\nEndnotes\nExpand\nAuthors\nKevin DeGood\nDirector, Infrastructure Policy\nAlso from CAP\nSupreme Court Appears Poised To Overrule Chevron Deference in Judicial Power Grab\nArticleJan 17, 2024\nSupreme Court Appears Poised To Overrule Chevron Deference in Judicial Power Grab\nJan 17, 2024\nJeevna Sheth, Devon Ombres\nScaling-Up High-Dosage Tutoring Is Crucial to Students’ Academic Success\nReportJan 18, 2024\nScaling-Up High-Dosage Tutoring Is Crucial to Students’ Academic Success\nJan 18, 2024\nPaige Shoemaker DeMio\n5 Immediate Effects of aJanuary 20 Partial Shutdown\nArticleJan 17, 2024\n5 Immediate Effects of aJanuary 20 Partial Shutdown\nJan 17, 2024\nJessica Vela, Bobby Kogan\nRegulators’ Bank Capital Proposals Don’t Go Far Enough To Improve Financial Stability\nArticleJan 16, 2024\nRegulators’ Bank Capital Proposals Don’t Go Far Enough To Improve Financial Stability\nJan 16, 2024\nMarc Jarsulic, Lilith Fellowes-Granda\nCenter for American Progress\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYouTube\nInstagram\nLinkedIn\nInProgress\nStay informed on the most pressing issues of our time.\nSign Up\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n©2024 Center for American Progress\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCAP - En Español\nOur Supporters"
