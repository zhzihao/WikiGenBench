Well, it seems we’re back to questioning the game’s existence again after a GameSpot report alleged Abandoned’s development is in disarray and that there is no game at all.WatchTrek To Yomi Is The Best Time You’ll Never Want To Have Again\nCCShare SubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoTrek To Yomi Is The Best Time You’ll Never Want To Have AgainThe Top Ten Most Played Games On Steam Deck: March 2023 EditionApril 7, 2023Comparing Resident Evil 4’s Chainsaw Demo To The Original GameMarch 15, 2023Abandoned has been mired in controversy since it was revealed almost a year ago. Originally suspected as a disguised Hideo Kojima project, Blue Box Game Studios was dragged for launching a barebones PS5 app with nothing in it but a brief teaser to a playable Prologue that still hasn’t materialized yet. The studio said that technical delays have disrupted its release timeline for the Prologue, but the fact that this demo of sorts hasn’t come out and the studio was quietly scrubbing its Twitter led some to wonder what’s going on. Turns out the game’s just “changing,” according to Blue Box Game Studios.AdvertisementRead More: Hyped PS5 Horror Game No One’s Really Seen Hasn’t Been Canceled, Dev SwearsAdvertisement“Changing” seems to be an understatement, though. In a GameSpot report in which the gaming outlet spoke to “more than half a dozen people who have had close contact with respect. Hasan never forced anyone to play games with him, and based on the chats shown, he always asked members.”The spokesperson disputed the “romantic” relationship claims against Kahraman, saying the archived messages were “more of a friendly chat.”Advertisement“The group ended in early April when one of the fans raged out of the group as they where told at some point to show a slice of the game,” the spokesperson said. “As a result of one of the members informing Hasan of that another member’s intention was to leak the slice, this demonstration never took place and Hasan stated this clearly. That is when the group started to end. Some angry members then reached out to GameSpot.”Still, none of this answers the real question: What the hell is going on? It’s been about a year since Abandoned was revealed and there’s been absolutely nothing to show for it. Not a new trailer or additional screenshots or anything. So if Blue Box Game Studios wants to silence nonbelievers, it should really consider peeling back the Abandoned curtain a little bit or just admit to everyone here and now that Abandoned has been…abandoned.AdvertisementKotaku has reached out to Sony for comment.Show all 70 commentsContinue reading"

Created by Ultraboy, the Elden Ring Modpack replaces several standard Tekken fighters with a variety of Elden Ring characters - including Melina, Ranni, and our favorite Pot Boy, Alexander. A video of the impressive mod has already gone viral, showcasing just how detailed the Elden Ring characters appear in Tekken. Marvel's Avengers has a game-breaking bug on PS5 and the only way to fix it right now is by deleting the campaign progress. The team behind Marvel Avengers will continue to investigate the issue causing a crash for some PS5 players and more news will be provided by tomorrow morning. Blue Box's Abandoned has been rumored to be ironically Abandoned. Tweets from a user report a playable demo was expected to arrive three months ago.
