You typically find such signs on large fountains.\nAs you wander the city, you’ll come across water facilities put there for your refreshment. They explicitly label these Trinkwasser (drinking water) to make it clear you can drink from them. Vienna has around 1300, and the city kindly provides a map of their locations.\nCooling facilities\nIn hot periods, the authorities also install a variety of water-based cooling facilities in busy areas.\nThese include mobile drinking fountains, as well as mist and water spraying devices designed to tackle urban heat: all part of a wider package to prevent and/or ameliorate the effects of the climate emergency.\nThe facilities sometimes come as a surprise if you’re not paying too much attention to your surroundings; you wander along a street in the blazing sunshine and have the unshakable feeling that someone just sprayed you with a plant mister.\nLast modified: August 14, 2023Ad:(Find a light classical concert for visitors )Eating, drinking & shopping\nThe best coffee houses\nTraditional food and drink\nMain courses\nWiener Schnitzel\nPastries and desserts\nCake guide & glossary\nWhere to get cake\nThe Sachertorte\nDining & shopping tips\nTop shopping locations\nRomantic dinner locations\nTips on tipping\nOrdering and paying\nAllergy information\nDrinking hours\nWhen are shops open?\nSouvenir & gift ideas\nCredit card use\nPrices: is Vienna expensive?\nSupermarkets\nStamps and post offices\nSearch this website\nBooking.com\n(Accommodation search provided by Booking.com*)\nDiscover Vienna\nEvents & activities\nHotel tips\nSightseeing in Vienna\nAt Christmas\nAt Easter\nAt New Year\nMuseums\nAlbertina\nBelvedere\nStephansdom\nSchönbrunn\nLocal food & drink\nComposers, artists etc.\nTravel and weather\nPublic transport\nEating out & shopping\nSightseeing passes\nVienna City Card\nGo City\nVienna Pass\nVisitor questions\nVisiting Vienna: advice & info from an independent local\nDisclaimer: I try and keep all information as up-to-date as possible, but check with official websites for certainty before you take a trip or make a purchase*I accept no payments from websites to talk about them or their products in an article.

The 50 three-meter-tall drinking fountains, dubbed \"Brunnhilde\", spray a cooling water mist throughout the city. The perfect refreshment on hot summer days.The Vienna Water Tower in Favoriten is a relic from the time of drinking water supply before the second spring was constructed; it's no longer connected to the water network, but it is a striking example of the \"industrial historicism\" style and is definitely worth a visit.All around is the water tower water playground, at 15,000 m² the largest water playground in Europe. The unique park landscape offers waterfalls, streams, ponds, bridges and pure relaxation on its extensive lawns. A water adventure path symbolizes and explains the journey of Viennese water from the mountains direct to Vienna!Excursion tip:In 1998, the first \"Vienna water line hiking path\" was opened along the most beautiful parts of the first Vienna spring water route. The hiking path is located just outside of Vienna, can be reached by public transportation such as bus or train, and is also manageable for leisure walkers.Further information:www.wienerwasser.at1st Vienna Water-Line Hiking Path: www.wien.gv.at/english/environment/watersupply/active/hikingpath.html\nWater Tower in Favoriten\nWindtenstrasse 3\n1100\nVienna\nhttps://www.wien.gv.at/wienwasser/bildung/wasserturm/index.html\n+43 1 599 59-31006\noeffentlichkeit@ma31.wien.gv.at\nOpening times\nApril\nto\nJune\nSeptember\nto\nOctober\nVisits are only possible as part of a guided tour:- Guided tours by appointment to be made 10 days before the requested date (minimum of 15 participants, 8 years and older).- Guided tours also take place duringvernissages.

People can fill up their water bottles at any time at one of the more than 1,300 fountains here. On October 24, 2023, exactly 150 years to the day since the opening of the First Vienna Mountain Spring Pipeline, an anniversary fountain designed by the internationally renowned artist collective Gelatin was unveiled at Helmut-Zilk-Platz in Vienna’s 10th district. Incidentally, the City of Vienna is the only one in the world to have put constitutional safeguards in place to protect its spring water for future generations: \"An extremely harmonious, easy-to-drink spring water that is the perfect companion for everything – with balanced mineralization and zero additives,\" says water sommelier Lin-Maurer.Text: Susanne Kapeller\nHochstrahlbrunnen\nSchwarzenbergplatz\n1040\nVienna\nMap\nPoints of interest in the area\nWater Tower in Favoriten\nWindtenstrasse 3\n1100\nVienna\nhttps://www.wien.gv.at/wienwasser/bildung/wasserturm/index.html\n+43 1 599 59-31006\noeffentlichkeit@ma31.wien.gv.at\nOpening times\nApril\nto\nJune\nSeptember\nto\nOctober\nVisits are only possible as part of a guided tour:- Guided tours by appointment to be made 10 days before the requested date (minimum of 15 participants, 8 years and older).- Guided tours also take place duringvernissages.
