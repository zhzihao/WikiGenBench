I am only half joking here because being 100% serious there must be a reason why they are making such bad shows, is it that they want to be able to say that Canadian content rules just don't work because no good shows can be made here so that they will be allowed to run more imported UK and USA shows which are the only decent thing they broadcast on their network? The acting, writing, etc, is all putrid, this show doesn't even make any sense let alone the fact that not one second of it even approaches being funny. But when you realize just how many other shows this network has made that all I repeat ALL suck you have to admit something is clearly going on at this network and I suspect they must be doing this on purpose out of some hidden motive. Popcultured, Punched Up, Girls will be Girls, Kevin Spencer, Comedy Inc, seriously it can not be a coincidence that they make this many shows that are completely unwatchable.helpful•22robertboylexSep 23, 2009Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateNovember 12, 2008 (Canada)Country of originCanadaLanguageEnglishFilming locationsWinnipeg, Manitoba, CanadaProduction companiesFarpoint FilmsInferno Pictures Inc.See more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime30 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio1.33 : 1Related newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapBy what name was House Party (2008) officially released in Canada in English?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episodeMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
