They pleaded no contest to two bias-motivated crimes.Aldrich will receive five consecutive life sentences without the possibility for parole on the murder charges, according to Judge Michael McHenry. Aldrich will also receive 46 consecutive 48-year sentences for the attempted murder counts followed by mandatory periods of parole, according to the judge.\"Like too many other people in our culture, you chose to find a power that day behind the trigger of a gun. Your actions reflect the deepest malice of the human heart and malice is almost always born out of ignorance and fear,\" said McHenry.He continued, \"The sentence of this court is the judgment of the people of the state of Colorado that such hate will not be tolerated and that the LGBTQ+ community is as much a part of the family of humanity as you are.\"They will plead no contest to \"a class five felony bias-motivated crime and class one misdemeanor bias-motivated crime\" with associated sentences, according to McHenry. They will also be sentenced to three years and 364 days respectively for the bias-motivated crimes.Anderson Lee Aldrich, 22, the suspect in the mass shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub appears with state public defenders Joseph Archambault and Michael Bowman before a judge during his advisement hearing in a video link from jail in Colorado Springs, Colo., Nov. 23, 2022, in a court artist sketch.Jane Rosenberg/ReutersDaniel Davis Aston, Kelly Loving, Derrick Rump, Ashley Paugh and Raymond Green Vance died in the attack. At least 19 people were also injured in the shooting.\"Ashley was an amazing woman who always showed so much love and kindness toward people,\" Paugh's sister, Stephanie Clark, said in court Monday. \"My world was shattered the morning of Nov. 20.\"\"The screams and the cries\" of Paugh's daughter after learning about her mother's death \"are forever etched in my mind,\" Clark said, wishing Aldrich could hear it for themself.\"Raymond was 22 years old -- a kind, loving, gentle man who touched a lot of people's hearts,\" said Adriana Vance, the mother of Green Vance. \"He was always there for his family and friends ... he never harmed a soul.\"Loving's sister, Tiffany Loving, remembers her as \"my compass, my best friend, my sister.\"\"Just like that my sister become a number of a violent statistic\" regarding the disproportionate rate of violence and victimization facing the transgender community,\" Tiffany Loving said in a statement. Loving was a transgender woman. \"She loved herself and wanted others to unapologetically be themselves.\"Investigators and witnesses said Aldrich opened fire as soon as they walked into Club Q before midnight on Nov. 19, 2022. Patrons at the venue tackled Aldrich, subduing them until police arrived, according to witnesses.\"You shot up my family,\" said Laura Kent, the mother of Wyatt Kent, one of the survivors of the shooting whose partner and close friend were killed in the attack, at the hearing. \"You will never understand the devastation you've caused.\"MORE: LGBTQ community 'in deep mourning' after Colorado Springs shootingIn February, preliminary hearings were held on whether the case against Aldrich was strong enough to move forward. Their defense attorneys focused on Aldrich's mental health and highlighted Aldrich's history of drug use and claimed they suffered abuse at home to counter the messaging that Aldrich was motivated by hate.MORE: With anti-drag laws on the rise, drag queens reclaim the art as form of protes\"Aldrich's behavior after this incident says they're sorry, upset and emotional about what they did,\" defense attorney Joseph Archambault said in court. \"It's categorically different than someone who targets a group, and that's not what Aldrich did.\"Lead investigators for the state said Aldrich administered and ran a website that hosted a \"neo Nazi white supremacist\" shooting training video, according to testimony from lead detective Rebecca Joines in the preliminary hearings. Joines also said that Aldrich used gay and racial slurs when playing video games online, in testimony aimed at Aldrich's bias charges.The defense has not openly commented on the case, as per Office of the State Public Defender policies.Related TopicsClub Q shootingTop StoriesMalia Obama makes red carpet debut at Sundance 20243 hours agoLos Angeles Innocence Project takes up case of notorious killer Scott PetersonJan 18, 6:42 PMHBCU administrator's death by suicide prompts calls for president's resignationJan 19, 1:03 AM15 students and 1 teacher drown when a boat capsizes in a lake in western IndiaJan 18, 9:35 AMConcertgoers sue Madonna over show starting lateJan 18, 12:06 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC News"

HamptonDENVER — The shooter who pleaded guilty to killing five people and injuring 17 others at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs was sentenced Monday to life in prison. Anderson Lee Aldrich, 23, who identifies as nonbinary and uses Mx. Aldrich, walked into the popular Club Q on Nov. 19, 2022, and opened fire. The shooter was charged with323 criminal countsincluding first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, first- and second-degree assault and bias-motivated crimes.The sentencing by Fourth Judicial District Judge Michael McHenry was expected to close the chapter on one of the worst mass killings in Colorado history, but the grief experienced by family and friends of the victims, as well as survivors, will continue indefinitely.People visit a makeshift memorial near the Club Q nightclub on Nov. 21, 2022 in Colorado Springs, Colo.Scott Olson / Getty ImagesFBI special agent Mark Michalek, who is in charge of the Denver field office, said during a news conference Monday that the agency has opened a case against Aldrich in conjunction with the Department of Justice. He did not provide additional details.FBI officials said later that an indictment or further charges could come from the DOJ or the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado.On the night of the shooting, the shooter first entered the club around 10:15 before walking back to the parking lot. The shooter re-entered shortly before midnight, wearing a ballistic vest and carrying an AR-15-style assault rifle and allegedly carried out the attack.The shooter was tackled and disarmed by patrons before being taken into custody by authorities.The victimswere aged 22 to 40.Survivors and family members of the victims addressed the court Monday during the sentencing portion of the hearing.Jeff Aston, the father of Daniel Aston, 28, said his son was a gifted poet with a contagious smile.“A positive force has been taken out of the world. He was in the prime of his life. He was happy, he had hopes, dreams and plans that will never be realized,” Aston said. “Losing him has caused us incredible grief and sadness.”Some family members said the punishment should be similar to the pain and destruction that the shooter caused.“This man doesn’t deserve to go on. What matters now is that he never sees the sun rise or a sunset,” said Adriana Vance, the mother of Raymond Green Vance, 22. She described her son as a kind, loving and gentle man who touched many people.“He was always there for his family and friends and people he didn’t even know,” the mother said.Army veteran Richard Fierro, who was at Club Q celebrating a birthday with family and friends, is one of two people who subdued the shooter. On Monday, he called the shooting an act of terrorism.“This terrorist has shown no remorse for human life. His decision to murder and maim that night is one that is unforgivable,” said Fierro, staring directly at the shooter, who was seated with hands cuffed and folded next to defense lawyers.“This terrorist is a coward and chose to target the innocent. That night I was forced to act in a way that was inhumane,” Fierro said.A drag performer of Club Q who survived the shooting said he lost his partner and sense of safety.“We as queer people were attacked. I forgive this individual as they are a symbol of a broken system of hate and vitriol pushed against us as a community,” the performer said.The massacre came 17 months after the shooter was arrested following a standoff that the suspect livestreamed with El Paso County sheriff’s deputies.After the suspect was arrested and jailed on suspicion of multiple counts of felony menacing and kidnapping, prosecutors decided not to pursue the case and the records were sealed, according to KUSA.The suspect’s mother, however, had reported that her child “was threatening to cause harm to her with a homemade bomb, multiple weapons, and ammunition,” the sheriff's department said in a news release.Richard Fierro, with his brother Ed, left, by his side, describes how he took the shooter down the night of the shooting at Club Q.Helen H. Richardson / Denver Post via Getty Images fileIn interviews, others who survivedthe shootingdescribed the terror they felt when the shooter started firing bullets indiscriminately.Michael Anderson, a bartender at Club Q, recalled in November that he heard “a few popping sounds” and initially assumed someone inside the club might have been clapping.“Then I looked up,” he said, “and I realized people were running.”CORRECTION(June 26, 2:30 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the first name of the shooter. The shooter is Anderson Aldrich, not Anthony.Deon J. HamptonDeon J.
