He was born in Acre in 1936 and died in his booby-trapped car in Beirut in 1972. His writings range from fiction to political essays, historical studies, theater and literary criticism.\nWe are publishing selected excerpts from Returning to Haifa, the\nimportant novella by Palestinian author Ghassan Kanafani, as it\nappeared in the collection Palestine's Children: Returning to Haifa\nand Other Stories, translated and edited by Barbara Harlow and\nKaren Riley (Boulder & London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2000).\nReturning to Haifa tells the story of a Palestinian couple who goes\nback to Haifa after the 1967 war to look for their baby, whom they\nwere forced to leave behind in the war of 1948.From the Introduction\nFor nearly a century, politics, violence, and diplomacy have all\nfailed to resolve the complex, mythified, and misunderstood clash\nthat since 1948 has come to be known as the Arab-Israeli conflict.\nCertainly it is not for lack of study; books on the subject in\nEnglish alone could fill a small-town library. Perhaps what has\nbeen missing - or ignored - throughout is the quotidian human\nreality underlying the vital history that continues to connect\nPalestinians everywhere to the land once called Palestine. Often,\nliterature can provide the human dimension that the historian's\nwork alone cannot. The literary works of the Palestinian writer\nGhassan Kanafani resonate with precisely that human\ndimension.********\nAbout the Book\n\"Politics and the novel,\" Ghassan Kanafani once said, \"are an\nindivisible case.\" Fadl al-Naqib has reflected that Kanafani \"wrote\nthe Palestinian story, then he was written by it.\" His narratives\noffer entry into the Palestinian experience of the conflict that\nhas anguished the people of the Middle East for most of the\ntwentieth century.In Palestine's Children, each story involves a child - a\nchild who is victimized by political events and circumstances, but\nwho nevertheless participates in the struggle toward a better\nfuture. As in Kanafani's other fiction, these stories explore the\nneed to recover the past - the lost homeland - by action. At the\nsame time, written by a major talent, they have a universal\nappeal.********\nBorn in Acre (northern Palestine) in 1936, Ghassan Kanafani was a\nprominent spokesman for the Popular Front for the Liberation of\nPalestine and founding editor of its weekly magazine\nAl-Hadaf. His novels and short stories have been published\nin 16 languages. He, along with his niece, was killed in Beirut in\n1972 in the explosion of his booby-trapped car. An Israeli\njournalist later quoted a Mossad agent as saying that Kanafani\nshould not have been on the list of assassinations which were\ncarried out by the Israeli intelligence agency.Excerpts from the novella\nWhen he reached the edge of Haifa, approaching by car along the\nJerusalem road, Said S. had the sensation that something was\nbinding his tongue, compelling him to keep silent, and he felt\ngrief well up inside of him. For one moment he was tempted to turn\nback, and without even looking at her he knew that his wife had\nbegun to cry silently. Then suddenly came the sound of the sea,\nexactly the way it used to be. Oh no, the memory did not return to\nhim little by little. Instead, it rained down inside his head the\nway a stone wall collapses, the stones pilling up, one upon the\nanother. The incidents and the events came to him suddenly and\nbegan to pile up and fill his entire being. He told himself that\nSafiyya, his wife, felt exactly the same, and that was why she was\ncrying.\nEver since he left Ramallah that morning he had not stopped\ntalking, nor had she. Beneath his gaze, the fields sped by through\nthe windshield, and the heat was unbearable. He felt his forehead\ncatch fire, exactly like the burning asphalt beneath the car's\nwheels, while above him the sun, the terrible June sun, spilled the\ntar of its anger upon the earth.\nAll along the way he talked and talked and talked. He spoke to his\nwife about everything - about the war and about the defeat, about\nthe Mandelbaum Gate, demolished by bulldozers. And about the enemy,\nwho reached the river, then the canal, then the edge of Damascus in\na matter of hours. And about the ceasefire, and the radio, and the\nway the soldiers plundered belongings and furniture, and the\ncurfew, and his cousin in Kuwait consumed with anxiety, and the\nneighbor who gathered his things and fled, and the three Arab\nsoldiers who fought alone for two days on the hill near Augusta\nVictoria Hospital, and the men who took off their army uniforms and\nfought in the streets of Jerusalem, and the peasant who was killed\nthe minute they saw him near the largest hotel in Ramallah. His\nwife spoke of many other matters. Throughout the entire journey\nneither of them stopped talking. Now, as they reached the entrance\nto Haifa, they both fell silent. At that moment they both realized\nthat they had not spoken a word about the matter which had brought\nthem there.\nThis is Haifa, then, twenty years later.\nNoon, June 30, 1967. The car, a gray Fiat bearing white Jordanian\nlicense plates, was traveling north, across the plain which was\ncalled Ibn Amr twenty years ago. It ascended the coastal road\ntoward the southern entrance to Haifa. When the car crossed the\nroad and entered the main street, all the walls came down and the\nroad dissolved behind a film of tears. He heard himself say to his\nwife, \"This is Haifa, Safiyya!\"\nThe steering wheel felt heavy between his palms, which had begun to\nsweat more profusely than they ever had before. It occurred to him\nto say to his wife, \"I know this Haifa, but it refuses to\nacknowledge me.\" However, he changed his mind and after a moment a\nthought struck him, and he said to her:\n\"You know, for twenty long years I always imagined that the\nMandelbaum Gate would be opened some day, but I never, never\nimagined that it would be opened from the other side. It never\nentered my mind. So when they were the ones to open it, it seemed\nto me frightening and absurd and to a great degree humiliating.\nMaybe I'd be crazy if I told you that doors should always open from\none side only and that, if they opened from the other side, they\nmust still be considered closed. But nevertheless, that's the\ntruth.\"\nHe turned toward his wife, but she wasn't listening. She was turned\naway from him, absorbed in gazing at the road - now to the right,\nwhere the farmland stretched away as far as one could see, and now\nto the left, where to sea, which had remained so distant for more\nthan twenty years, was raging near at hand. Suddenly she\nsaid:\n\"I never imagined that I would see Haifa\nagain.\"\nHe said:\n\"You're not seeing it. They're showing it to\nyou.\"\nWith that, Safiyya's nerves failed her for the\nfirst time and she shouted:\n\"What's all this 'philosophy' you've been\nspouting all day long? The gates and the sights and everything\nelse. What happened to you?\"********\n\"They opened the border as soon as they completed the occupation,\nsuddenly and immediately. That has never happened in any war in\nhistory. You know the terrible thing that happened in April 1948,\nso now, why this? Just for our sakes alone? No! This is part of the\nwar. They're saying to us, 'Help yourselves, look and see how much\nbetter we are than you, how much more developed. You should accept\nbeing our servants. You should admire us.\" But you've seen it\nyourself. Nothing's changed. It was in our power to have done much\nbetter than they did.\"\n\"Then why did you come?\"\nHe looked at her angrily and she fell\nsilent.\nShe knew. Why did she need to ask? She was the\none who told him to come. For twenty long years she avoided talking\nabout it, twenty years. Then the past erupted as though forced out\nby a volcano.\nAs he drove the car through the center of Haifa, the smell of war\nwas still strong enough to make the city seem to him dark and\nexcited and agitated, the faces harsh and savage. After a little\nwhile he realized that he was driving the car through Haifa with\nthe feeling that nothing in the streets had changed. He used to\nknow Haifa stone by stone, intersection by intersection. How often\nhe had crossed that road in his green 1946 Ford! Oh he knew Haifa\nwell, and now he felt as though he hadn't been away for twenty\nyears. He was driving his car just as he used to, as though he\nhadn't been absent those twenty bitter years.\nThe names began to rain down inside his head as though a great\nlayer of dust had been shaken off them: Wadi Nisnas, King Faisal\nStreet, Hanatir Square, Halisa, Hadar…The events mixed\ntogether suddenly, but he held himself together and asked his wife\nin a barely audible voice:\n\"Well, where shall we begin?\"\nShe was quiet. He heard her crying softly, almost silently, and he\ncalculated to himself the suffering she was enduring. He knew he\ncouldn't really comprehend that suffering precisely, but he did\nknow it was very great, and that it had remained so for twenty\nyears. Now it was welling up like some incredible monster inside of\nher, in her head, in her heart, in her memories, in her\nimagination, controlling her entire future. He was amazed that he\nhad never thought about what that suffering must have meant to her,\nand about the extent to which it was buried in the wrinkles of her\nface and in her eyes and in her mind. It was with her in every bite\nof food she took and in every hut where she had lived and in every\nlook she cast at her children and at him and at herself. Now all of\nit was bursting forth from the wreckage and the oblivion and the\npain, to carry away the mass of bitter defeat he had tasted at\nleast twice in his lifetime.********\nMorning, Wednesday, April 21, 1948. Haifa, the city, was not\nexpecting anything, in spite of the fact that it was filled with\ndark tension.\nThunder came abruptly from the east, from the heights of Mount\nCarmel. Mortar shells flew across the city's center, pelting the\nArab quarters.\nThe streets of Haifa turned into chaos. Alarm swept through the\ncity as it closed its shops and the windows of its houses.\nSaid S. was in the center of town when the sounds of shots and\nexplosions started to fill the sky above Haifa. Up until noon he\nhadn't expected that this would be the all-out attack, so it wasn't\nuntil then that he tried to return home in his car, but he soon\ndiscovered that this was impossible. He went down the side streets\nin an attempt to cross the road to Halisa, where he lived, but the\nfighting had already spread, and he saw armed men racing from side\nstreet to main road and from main road to side street. They moved\nin obedience to instructions blaring from loudspeakers placed here\nand there. After a while Said felt he was rushing helter-skelter,\nyet the alleyways, closed off by machine guns or bullets or the\nsoldiers themselves, seemed to be pushing him unconsciously in one\ndirection only. Over and over as he tried to return to his real\ndirection, picking out a particular alley, he found himself pushed\nby an unseen force toward one road only, the road to the\ncoast.\nHe had married Safiyya a year and four months before and had rented\na house in a neighborhood he figured would be safe. But now he felt\nhe wouldn't reach it. He knew his young wife wouldn't be able to\ncope. Ever since he had brought her from the country she'd been\nunable to deal with city life or get used to all the complications\nwhich seemed to her terrifying and insoluble. What would happen to\nher now, he wondered?\nHe was lost, nearly. He didn't know exactly where or how the\nfighting was taking place. As far as he knew, the British still\ncontrolled the city and this whole situation should have taken\nplace in approximately three weeks, when the British would begin to\nwithdraw in accordance with the date they had fixed.\nAs he quickened his pace he knew for certain that he had to avoid\nthe high sections of town adjoining Herzl Street, where the Jews\nhad been headquartered from the beginning. But he also had to stay\naway from the business district between Halisa and Allenby Street,\nfor that was the Jews' strongest arms base.\nSo he sped along trying to circle around the business district in\norder to reach Halisa. Before him was the road that ends at Wadi\nNisnas and passes through the Old City.\nAll of a sudden things got mixed up and the names became tangled up\nin his head: Halisa, Wadi Rushmiyya, the Burj, the Old City, Wadi\nNisnas. He felt completely lost, that he had even lost his sense of\ndirection. The explosions intensified. Even though he was far\nenough away from the site of the shooting he could still make out\nBritish soldiers who were boarding up some windows and opening\nothers.\nSomehow he found himself in the Old City and from there he raced\nwith a strength he didn't know he possessed toward South Stanton\nStreet. And then he knew he was less than two hundred meters away\nfrom Halul Street, and he began to catch the scent of the\nsea.\nAt that exact moment he remembered little Khaldun, his son who was\nfive months old that very day, and a dark apprehension suddenly\nspread over him. It was the one taste that never left his tongue\nright up to this moment, twenty years after it happened for the\nfirst time.\nHad he expected that disaster? The events were mixed up, the past\nand present running together, both in turn jumbled up with the\nthoughts and illusions and imaginings and feelings of twenty\nsuccessive years. Had he known? Did he sense the calamity before it\nhappened? Sometimes he told himself, \"Yes, I knew it even before it\nhappened.\" Other times he said, \"No, I only imagined it after it\nhappened. I couldn't possibly have expected anything as horrifying\nas that.\"\nEvening began to settle over the city. He didn't know how many\nhours had passed as he rushed from street to street, but it was\nclear that he was being propelled toward the port. All the side\nstreets leading off the main road were closed. He kept plunging\ndown side streets trying to get to his house, but he was always\ndriven back, sometimes by rifle muzzles, sometimes by\nbayonets.\nThe sky was on fire, crackling with shots, bombs and explosions,\nnear and far. It was as though the very sounds themselves were\npushing everyone toward the port. Even though he could not\nconcentrate on anything specific, he couldn't help but see now the\nthrong of people thickened with every step. People were pouring\nfrom the side streets into the main street leading down to the port\n- men, women and children, empty-handed or carrying a few small\npossessions, crying or being floated along in a paralyzed silence\nin the midst of the clamor and confusion. He was swallowed up in\nthe rushing wave of humanity and lost the ability to direct his own\nsteps. He kept remembering that he was being swept along by the\ndazed and crying throng toward the sea, unable to think about\nanything else. In his head was one picture only, suspended as\nthough hanging on a wall: his wife Safiyya and his son\nKhaldun.********\nHe put his fingers on the bell and said to\nSafiyya quietly:\n\"They changed the bell.\"\nHe was silent a moment, then added:\n\"And the name. Naturally.\"\nHe forced a foolish smile onto his face and placed his hand over\nSafiyya's. Her hand was cold and trembling. From behind the door\nthey heard slow footsteps. \"An elderly person, no doubt,\" he said\nto himself. There was the muffled sound of a bolt creaking, and the\ndoor opened slowly.\n\"So this is she.\" He didn't know whether he said it out loud or to\nhimself in the form of a deep sigh. He remained standing in the\nsame place without knowing what he should do. He chided himself for\nnot having prepared an opening sentence in spite of the fact that\nhe had known with certainty that this is very moment would arrive.\nHe stirred himself and looked toward Safiyya for help. Umm Khalid\nthereupon took a step forward and said:\n\"May we come in?\"\nThe old woman didn't understand. She was short and rather plump and\nwas dressed in a blue dress with white polka dots. As Said began to\ntranslate into English, the lines of her face came together,\nquestioning. She stepped aside, allowing Said and Safiyya to enter,\nthen led them into the living room.\nSaid followed her, Safiyya at his side, with slow, hesitant steps.\nThey began to pick out the things around them with a certain\nbewilderment. The entrance seemed smaller than he had imagined it\nand felt a little damp. He saw many things he had once considered -\nand for that matter still considered - to be intimate and personal,\nthings he believed were sacred and private property which no one\nhad the right to become familiar with, to touch, or even to look\nat. A photograph of Jerusalem he remembered very clearly still hung\nwhere it had when he lived there. On the opposite wall a small\nSyrian carpet also remained where it had always hung.\nHe looked around, rediscovered the items, sometimes little by\nlittle and sometimes all at once, like someone recovering from a\nlong period of unconsciousness. When they reached the living room\nhe saw two chairs from the set of five he used to own. The other\nthree chairs were new, and they seemed crude and out of harmony\nwith the rest of the furnishings. In the center of the room was the\nsame inlaid table, although its color had faded a bit. The glass\nvase on top of the table had been replaced by a wooden one, and in\nit was a bunch of peacock feathers. He knew there used to be seven\nof them. He tried to count them from where he was sitting, but he\ncouldn't, so he got up, moved closer to the vase and counted them\none by one. There were only five.\nWhen he turned to go back to his seat, he saw that the curtains\nwere different. The ones Safiyya had made twenty years ago from\nsugar-colored yarn had been taken down and replaced by curtains\nwith long blue threads running through them.\nThen his gaze fell on Safiyya and he saw that she seemed confused.\nShe was examining the corners of the room as though counting up the\nthings that were missing. The old woman was sitting in front of\nthem on the arm of one of the chairs, looking at them with a blank\nsmile on her face. Finally, without changing her smile, she\nsaid:\n\"I have been expecting you for a long\ntime.\"\nHer English was hesitant and marked by something like a German\naccent. She seemed to be pulling the words up out of a bottomless\nwell as she pronounced them.\nSaid leaned forward and asked her:\n\"Do you know who we are?\"\nShe nodded several times to emphasize her\ncertainty. She thought for a moment, choosing her words, then said\nslowly:\n\"You are the owners of this house. I know\nthat.\"\n\"How do you know?\"\nSaid and Safiyya both asked the question simultaneously.\nThe old woman continued to smile. Then she\nsaid:\n\"From everything. From the photographs, from the\nway the two of you stood in front of the door. The truth is, ever\nsince the war ended many people have come here, looking at the\nhouses and going into them. Every day I said that surely you would\ncome.\"\nAt once she seemed to become confused and began to look around at\nthe things distributed throughout the room as though she were\nseeing them for the first time. Involuntarily, Said followed her\nglance, moving his eyes from place to place as she moved hers.\nSafiyya did the same. He said to himself, \"How strange! Three pairs\nof eyes looking at one thing…but how differently each see\nit!\"\nThe old woman spoke then, more quietly now and even more\nslowly.\n\"I'm sorry. But that's what happened. I never thought things would\nbe the way they are now.\"********\nIphrat Koshen didn't need anyone to tell him that the English had\nan interest in delivering Haifa into the hands of the Haganah. It\nwas well within his knowledge that they had played, and continued\nto play, a joint role. He'd seen it for himself two or three times.\nHe didn't remember how he came by the information about the role of\nBrigadier Stockwell, but he was sure it was true. The rumor was\ncirculating in every corner of the Haganah. He concealed the date\nof the British withdrawal and leaked it only to the Haganah,\nthereby giving them the element of surprise at the most appropriate\nmoment, when the Arabs were figuring that the British Army would\nrelinquish its power at a later date.\nIphrat stayed at the Emigres' Lodge all that Wednesday and\nThursday, for they had been instructed not to leave the building.\nSome began to go out on Friday, but he didn't go out until Saturday\nmorning. He was immediately struck by the fact that he didn't see\nany cars. It was a true Jewish Sabbath! This brought tears to his\neyes for reasons he couldn't explain. When his wife saw this, she\ntoo was surprised and said to him with tears in her own eyes:\n\"I'm crying for another reason. Yes, this is a true Sabbath. But\nthere is no longer a true Sabbath on Friday, nor a true one on\nSunday.\"\nThat was just the beginning. For the first time since his arrival,\nhis wife had called his attention to something troubling, something\nwhich he had neither counted on nor thought about. The signs of\ndestruction that he began to notice took on another meaning, but he\nrefused to let himself worry or even think about it.\nFrom the standpoint of his wife Miriam, however, the situation was\ndifferent. It changed that very day as she passed near Bethlehem\nChurch in Hadar. She saw two young men from the Haganah carrying\nsomething, which they put in a small truck stopped nearby. In a\nflash she saw what it was they were carrying. She grabbed he\nhusband's arm and, trembling, cried out:\n\"Look!\"\nBut her husband didn't see anything when he looked where she was\npointing. The two men were wiping their palms on the sides of their\nkhaki shirts. She said to her husband: \"That was a dead Arab child!\nI saw it! And it was covered in blood!\"\nHer husband guided her across the street, then\nasked:\n\"How do you know it was an Arab child?\"\n\"Didn't you see how they threw it onto the truck,\nlike a piece of wood? If it had been a Jewish child they would\nnever have done that.\"\nHe wanted to ask her why, but when he saw her face, he remained\nsilent.\nMiriam had lost her father at Auschwitz eight years before. When\nthey raided the house where she lived with her husband, he wasn't\nhome, so she took refuge with the upstairs neighbors. The German\nsoldiers didn't find anyone, but on their way back down the stairs\nthey came upon her ten-year-old brother, who most likely had been\non his way to tell her that their father had been sent to the\ncamps, leaving him all alone. When he saw the German soldiers, he\nturned and began running away. She saw it all through the narrow\nslit made by a short gap between the stairs. She also saw how they\nshot him down.********\nSaid didn't touch Miriam's coffee. Safiyya took just one sip, and\nwith it a piece of one of the tinned biscuits Miriam had smilingly\nput before them.\nSaid continued to look around. His confusion had lessened somewhat\nas he listened to Miriam's story unfold little by little during\nwhat seemed a very long time. He and Safiyya remained nailed to\ntheir chairs, waiting for something unknown to take place,\nsomething they couldn't imagine.\nMiriam came and went, and each time she disappeared behind the\ndoor, they listened to her slow steps dragging along the floor\ntiles. If she closed her eyes, Safiyya could imagine exactly Miriam\ngoing down the hall leading to the kitchen. On the right was the\nbedroom. Once, when they heard a door slam, Safiyya looked at Said\nand said bitterly:\n\"As if she's in her own house! She acts as if\nit's her house!\"\nThey smiled in silence. Said pressed his palms\ntogether between his knees, unable to decide that to do. Finally\nMiriam returned and they asked her:\n\"When will he get here?\"\n\"It's time for him to return now, but he's late.\nHe never was on time getting home. He's just like his father. He\nwas…\"\nShe broke off. Biting her lip, she looked at Said, who was\ntrembling as if he'd been hit by an electric shock. \"Like his\nfather!\" Then suddenly he asked himself, \"What is fatherhood?\" It\nwas like throwing a window wide open to an unexpected cyclone. He\nput his head between his hands to try to stop the wild spinning of\nthe question that had been suppressed somewhere in his mind for\ntwenty years, the question he'd never dared to face. Safiyya began\nto stroke his shoulder, for in some uncanny way she understood what\nhe felt, the sudden impact of words colliding to bring about the\ninevitable. She said:\n\"Look who's talking! She said, 'Like his father!' As if Khaldun had\na father other than you!\"\nBut then Miriam stepped forward and stood preparing herself to say\nsomething difficult. Slowly she began to extract the words, and it\nseemed as though unseen hands were pulling them from the depths of\na well of dust.\n\"Listen, Mr. Said. I want to tell you something important. I wanted\nyou to wait for Dov - or Khaldun, if you like - so you could talk\nto each other and the matter could end as it naturally should end.\nDo you think this hasn't been as much of a problem for me as it's\nbeen for you? For the past twenty years I've been confused, but now\nthe time has come for us to finish the matter. I know who his\nfather is. And I also know that he is our son. But let's call on\nhim to decide. Let's call on him to choose. He's of age and we must\nrecognize that he's the only one who has the right to choose. Do\nyou agree?\"\nSaid got up and walked around the room. He stopped in front of the\ninlaid table and once more began to count the feathers in the\nwooden vase perched there. He said nothing. He kept silent as\nthough he had not heard a word. Miriam watched him expectantly.\nFinally, he turned to Safiyya and told her what Miriam had said.\nSafiyya got up and stood by his side and said, her voice\ntrembling:\n\"That's a fair choice. I'm certain Khaldun will choose his real\nparents. It's impossible to deny the call of flesh and\nblood.\"\nSaid burst out laughing, his laughter filled with a profound\nbitterness that bespoke defeat.\n\"What Khaldun, Safiyya? What Khaldun? What flesh and blood are you\ntalking about? You say this is a fair choice? They've taught him\nhow to be for twenty years, day by day, hour by hour, with his\nfood, his drink, his sleep. And you say, a fair choice! Truly\nKhaldun, or Dov, or the devil if you like, doesn't know us! Do you\nwant to know what I think? Let's get out of here and return to the\npast. The matter is finished. They stole him.\"\nHe looked over at Safiyya, who had collapsed into her chair. All at\nonce, for the first time, she faced the truth. Said's words seemed\nto her to be true, but she was still trying to hang on to the\ninvisible thread of hope she had constructed in her imagination for\ntwenty years as a sort of bribe. Her husband said to her:\n\"Maybe he never knew at all that he was born of Arab parents. Or\nmaybe he learned it a month ago, a week ago, a year ago. What do\nyou think? He was deceived, and perhaps he was even more\nenthusiastic in the deception than they were. The crime began\ntwenty years ago and there's no doubt who paid the price. It began\nthe day we left him here.\"\n\"But we didn't leave him. You know that.\"\n\"Yes, sure. We shouldn't have left anything. Not Khaldun, not the\nhouse, not Haifa! Didn't the same frightening feeling come over you\nthat came over me while I was driving the streets of Haifa? I felt\nas though I knew Haifa, yet the city refused to acknowledge me. I\nhad the same feeling in this house, here, in our house. Can you\nimagine that? That our house would refuse to acknowledge us? Don't\nyou feel it? I believe the same thing will happen with Khaldun.\nYou'll see!\"********\n\"What did the two of them come for? Don't tell me they want to take\nme back?\"\nIn a similar manner, Miriam replied:\n\"Ask them.\"\nHe turned stiffly, as if following an order, and\nasked Said:\n\"What do you want, sir?\"\nSaid held his composure, which seemed to him to be nothing more\nthat a thin shell barely covering a smoldering flame. His voice\nmuffled, he said:\n\"Nothing. Nothing, just…curiosity, you\nknow.\"\nA sudden silence fell, and through it rose the sounds of Safiyya's\nsobs, rather like the creaking chair of an uninvolved observer. The\nyoung man shifted his gaze again from Said to Miriam, then to his\ncap lying against the wooden vase. He retreated as if something had\nforced him back toward the chair beside Miriam. He sat down,\nsaying:\n\"No. It's impossible. It's incredible.\"\nSaid asked quietly:\n\"You're in the army? Who are you fighting?\nWhy?\"\nThe young man jumped to his feet.\n\"You have no right to ask those questions. You're\non the other side.\"\n\"I? I'm on the other side?\"\nSaid laughed heartily. And with that explosive laughter he felt as\nif he were pushing out all the pain and the tension and fear and\nanguish in his chest. He wanted to keep on laughing and laughing\nuntil the entire world was turned upside down or until he fell\nasleep or died or raced out to his car. But the young man cut him\noff sharply.\n\"I see no reason to laugh.\"\n\"I do.\"\nHe laughed a little longer then stopped and became silent as\nsuddenly as he had burst out laughing. He leaned back in his chair,\nfeeling his calmness return, fishing through his pockets for a\ncigarette.\nThe silence lengthened. Then Safiyya, who had composed herself,\nasked in a subdued voice:\n\"Don't you feel that we are your parents?\"\nNo one knew to whom the question was addressed. Miriam certainly\ndidn't understand it, nor did the tall young man. As for Said, he\ndidn't answer. He finished his cigarette then and went over to the\ntable to put it out. He felt a compulsion in the process to rip the\ncap from its place, so he did, smiling scornfully, then went back\nand sad down.\nAt that, the young man, his voice completely\nchanged, said:\n\"We need to talk like civilized people.\"\nAgain, Said laughed.\n\"You don't want to negotiate, isn't that right?\nYou said you and I are on opposite sides. What happened? Do you\nwant to negotiate, or what?\"\nAgitated, Safiyya asked:\n\"What did he say?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\nThe youth stood up again. He began to speak as though he had\nprepared the sentences long ago.\n\"I didn't know that Miriam and Iphrat weren't my parents until\nabout three or four years ago. From the time I was small I was a\nJew…I went to Jewish school, I studied Hebrew, I go to\nTemple, I eat kosher food…When they told me I wasn't their\nown child, it didn't change anything. Even when they told me -\nlater on - that my original parents were Arabs, it didn't change\nanything. No, nothing changed, that's certain. After all, in the\nfinal analysis, man is a cause.\"\n\"Who said that?\"\n\"Said what?\"\n\"Who said that man is a cause?\"\n\"I don't know, I don't remember. Why do you\nask?\"\n\"Curiosity. Actually, just because that's exactly\nwhat was going through my mind at this moment.\"\n\"That man is a cause?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"Then why did you come looking for me?\"\n\"I don't know. Maybe because I didn't know it, or to be more\ncertain about it. I don't know. Anyway, go on.\"\nThe young man began pacing again with his hands clasped behind his\nback: three steps toward the door, three steps towards the table.\nHe seemed to be trying to recall a long lesson learned by heart.\nCut off in the middle, he didn't know how to finish, so he reviewed\nthe first part silently in his head in order to be able to\ncontinue. Abruptly, he said:\n\"After I learned that you were Arabs, I kept asking myself: How\ncould a father and mother leave their five-month-old son behind and\nrun off? How could a mother and father not his own raise him and\neducate him for twenty years? Twenty years? Do you wish to say\nanything, sir?\"\n\"No,\" Said replied briefly and decisively, motioning with his hand\nfor him to continue.\n\"I'm in the Reserves now, I haven't been in direct combat yet so I\ncan't describe my feelings…but perhaps in the future I'll be\nable to confirm to you what I'm about to say: I belong here, and\nthis woman is my mother. I don't know the two of you, and I don't\nfeel anything towards you.\"\n\"There's no need for you to explain your feelings to me later on.\nMaybe your first battle will be with a fida'i named Khalid. Khalid\nis my son. I beg you to notice that I did not say he's your\nbrother. As you said, man is a cause. Last week Khalid joined the\nfedayeen. Do you know why we named him Khalid and not Khaldun?\nBecause we always thought we'd find you, even if it took twenty\nyears. But it didn't happen. We didn't find you, and I don't\nbelieve we will find you.\"********"
