That's the highest hitting percentage allowed by Penn State this season.\nSet 1\nFive Penn State players had three or more kills as the team hit .552 behind 15 assists from Podraza in the Nittany Lions' 25-15 win in the opening set. Mruzik led the way with four kills. Penn State jumped out to a 4-0 lead on a kill by Mruzik and eventually went up 7-1 on another Mruzik kill.

Mruzik went on to end the set with a kill.\nSet 2\nPenn State hit .394 behind 13 assists from Podraza in a 25-23 win in set two. The Nittany Lions led 24-21 after a kill by Mruzik. Nebraska fought off two set points before Mruzik struck again with her sixth kill of the set to give the Nittany Lions a 2-0 lead in the match. Hannah had four kills in the set, while Trammell was perfect on her three swings and added three blocks.\nSet 3\nNebraska held Penn State to .119 hitting in a 25-18 win in set three. Nebraska started fast with a 6-1 advantage. The Nittany Lions got as close as one at 7-6 on a kill by Mruzik, but the Huskers responded with a 3-0 run and led the rest of the way.\nSet 4\nNebraska used a 5-0 run to go up 16-9 on its way to a 25-20 win in the fourth set. Beason was nearly perfect with six kills on seven swings. Mruzik was strong on the other side with five kills on six swings for Penn State.\nSet 5\nNebraska took the final set 15-13. Penn State scored first, but Nebraska scored the next four points and eventually went up 8-3.

- The No. 1 Nebraska volleyball team fought back from an 0-2 deficit to beat No. 16 Penn State 3-2 at Rec Hall on Friday night.\nIn front of the largest Penn State home crowd in 20 years (6,645), the Huskers stormed back after dropping the first two sets by scores of 25-15 and 25-23. Nebraska turned it around in sets three and four, winning 25-18 and 25-20. In the fifth set, the Huskers led 8-3 but allowed Penn State to come back and tie the score, and it remained tied at 13-13 before Harper Murray and Merritt Beason recorded back-to-back kills to win the match and help the Huskers (22-0, 13-0 Big Ten) remain unbeaten. Penn State fell to 15-7 overall and 9-4 in the Big Ten.\nThe last time the Huskers came back from an 0-2 deficit to win in five sets was on March 12, 2021 against Ohio State at the Devaney Center. The last time the Huskers accomplished that feat in a true road match was Sept. 6, 2018 at Creighton. The Huskers won their seventh match in a row against Penn State.\nBeason had a career-high 27 kills on .426 hitting with five digs and three blocks. Her 27 kills tied Mikaela Foecke's 27 kills in 2018 as the most by a Husker since 2013.\nMurray finished with 15 kills and 14 digs and hit .379. Bekka Allick had a season-high 11 kills with a .381 hitting percentage and a team-high five blocks. Andi Jackson provided nine kills on .389 hitting with three blocks, and Ally Batenhorst finished with seven kills and four blocks.\nBergen Reilly set the Huskers to a .288 hitting percentage with 52 assists and 13 digs. Lexi Rodriguez had 13 digs and a career-high 11 set assists.\nPenn State hit .298 for the match and had a 17-9 edge in blocks. But the Huskers had 12 more kills (71-59) and six more digs (56-50). NU served two aces and wasn't aced by the Nittany Lions all night. Both teams had 12 service errors.\nJezz Mruzik had 21 kills for Penn State.\nSet 1: Nebraska got off to a slow start as Penn State scored the first four points and led 7-1. The Nittany Lions proceeded to go up 15-5 before two kills by Murray and one by Allick brought the Big Red within 15-8. But after seven straight sideout rallies, Taylor Trammell put Penn State ahead 20-11 with a kill. The Nittany Lions won 25-15, hitting .552 in the set, while Nebraska hit .310.\nSet 2: Penn State used a 6-0 run to take a 9-4 lead. Two kills by Allick and a block by Allick and Beason pulled the Huskers within 12-11. The Nittany Lions answered with a 4-1 run to go up 16-12, but a kill by Jackson helped the Huskers get back within one, 17-16. Once again, Penn State answered and went back up by five, 23-18. Beason and Allick had kills as NU cut it to 23-21, but Penn State claimed set point after a successful challenge resulted in a kill. Beason brought the Huskers within one again after back-to-back kills, but Mruzik ended the set at 25-23 with a kill.\nSet 3: Nebraska tried to get some momentum going with a 4-0 start to the third set. Allick, Beason and Murray all had kills with Reilly at the service line. The Huskers led 6-1 before Penn State went on a 5-1 run to cut it to 7-6. Beason had a kill before a solo block by Batenhorst and kill by Jackson made it 10-6 Big Red. The teams traded sideouts with Murray and Beason posting kills to keep NU in front by four. A service error by Penn State gave the Huskers a 15-10 lead, but the Nittany Lions scored three of the next four to cut it to 16-13. Then Beason and Murray came up with kills for an 18-14 advantage, and Reilly dumped a kill before teaming up with Allick for a block that made it 20-15 Huskers. Murray had two more kills, and Beason and Jackson each had one as the Huskers closed out a 25-18 win to stay alive.\nSet 4: Holding a 9-8 lead, the Huskers went on a 7-1 run to seize control at 16-9. Beason started the spurt with a kill and a block with Jackson. Jackson and Batenhorst added kills during a Beason service run, which included an ace by the junior captain. Batenhorst, Beason and Reilly tallied kills for a 19-13 advantage, but Penn State chipped away to get within 22-19. Batenhorst and Murray answered with key kills for the Big Red to earn set point, 24-19, and Murray finished the set with a kill for a 25-20 win.\nSet 5: After Penn State scored first, Beason and Murray tallied kills before a block by Allick and Batenhorst and another kill by Beason made it 4-1. Penn State scored the next two, but Allick sided out with a kill and Beason connected on two in a row before Batenhorst put the Huskers up 8-3 as the teams changed sides. Penn State scored a 4-0 run to close the gap to 8-7 before Beason earned a sideout kill. The Nittany Lions tied the set 9-9, but NU went back in front with kills by Batenhorst, Allick and Murray to make it 13-11. A Husker hitting error and Penn State block tied the score at 13-13, but Murray and Beason provided the final two kills for a 15-13 win.\nUp Next: The Huskers will head to Rutgers for a match on Sunday at Noon (CT).Highlights Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window Opens in a new window © Nebraska Huskers, All rights reserved.

Their demise was a strong schedule early on — which the Nittany Lions usually handle well — but consecutive losses to Georgia Tech and Florida bumped their preseason No. 8 spot all the way to No. 14 in Week 1; they haven't gotten back to the top 10 since.\nTo be fair, Penn State has seen a lot of turnover on its roster, and the team has had to learn how to play together through some trial and error.Transfers Mac Podraza and JessMruzik entered the starting rotation at the beginning of the season and have completely commanded the court, leading the team in assists (591) and kills (244), respectively.\nWhat Nebraska has that Penn State doesn't, however, is depth throughout the entire rotation. The Huskers are on a dominant 16-0 run right now, and their roster boasts some of the best of the best in the nation. Bekka Allick swarms the block, ranking 11th in the nation defensively with 1.45 B/S. AVCA All-American Lexi Rodriguez takes care of backcourt defense — averaging 3.5 D/S — while Merritt Beason and Andi Jackson handle things up top... It's a dream setup.\nWhat both teams can take advantage of? The serve.\nIf you scroll all the way to the last page of \"team service aces\" for this year, you'll find Nebraska at No. 316 with 64 aces, and Penn State at No. 330 (out of 332 teams) with 53. This is a statline that both teams can capitalize on for this game, as well as limiting service errors. Nebraska has erred 124 times (about 8 per game) at the service line this year, while Penn State has 115 SE.\nPenn State has just now started to get challenged in conference play, battling through its first five-setters against Indiana and Ohio State during Week 6 to maintain its perfect conference record (7-0). The Nittany Lions picked up their most recent win against Iowa on Friday night. As for No. 2 Nebraska, it has cruised through its early schedule thus far and just took care of Michigan State in four sets yesterday before switching its gears to PSU tonight.\nBoth squads are undefeated in the Big Ten, and have been unbeaten for weeks.

The last time NU accomplished that on the road was at Creighton in 2018.For Nebraska to have any hope of erasing a 0-2 deficit, it needed to take its serving and blocking up a notch. That steadily happened.“We served great in Game 5. I’m not sure they were in-system once,” Cook said.\nPenn State was excellent to start the match. The Nittany Lions got out to a 7-1 lead. When their lead reached 12-3, they already recorded seven kills on 10 attempts.Penn State hit .552 for the set with 16 kills on 29 attempts.\n“They were flawless Game 1,” Cook said. “Every ball was on the money. They were thumping, and they were running middle.”The second set was close most of the way, but Nebraska couldn't get Penn State out of system, so its offensecontinued to run smoothly.Late in the set, Nebraska cut its deficit to 24-23 on a kill by Beason.
