We’re proud that Massachusetts has charted a different course, passing best-in-the-nation abortion protections, safeguards for gender-affirming care providers, and major voting reforms. Together, we’re making the Commonwealth a safer, more just, and more welcoming place for all.\nBut challenges remain. Bay Staters won’t feel at home in our democracy and our society until we can live our full lives and be our full selves—when we can seek medical care, drive to work, go about our daily lives without fear of surveillance, false arrest, or needless criminalization. We won’t feel at home while we face unjust and unnecessary economic roadblocks. We won’t feel at home if we cannot equitably access our local government.\nWe need a civil liberties approach to the challenges that hold people back. It's a daunting task, but there are clear steps that lawmakers can take to build on recent progress.\nHere are the ACLU of Massachusetts’ priorities for the 2023-2024 legislative session:\nIncrease Participatory Democracy\nSafeguard Our Digital Privacy\nRespect Personal Autonomy & Ensure Reproductive Health Access\nCreate Pathways to Economic Opportunity\nStrengthen Civil Rights & Racial Justice\nAdopt a Public Health Approach to Substance Use\nReduce Harms of Incarceration\nEnhance Youth Justice\nDownload 2023-2024 Legislative Priorities\nLocation Shield Act(H.357/S.148) | Learn More(Aprende más)| Testimony|Take Action!\nDriver Privacy(H.3404)|Testimony\nBiometric Privacy (H.63)\nConsumer Health Data (H.386/S.184)\nMassachusetts Data Privacy Protection Act (H.83/S.25) | Learn More| Testimony\nPrivate Electronic Communication & Browsing (H.1653/S.27)| Testimony\nArtificial Intelligence Commission (H.64/S.33)| Testimony\nLocation Shield Act(H.357/S.148) | Learn More(Aprende más)| Testimony|Take Action!\nFull-Spectrum Pregnancy Coverage (H.1137/S.646) | Testimony\nBirthing Justice & Maternal Health Equity (S.1415)\nEnhancing Access to Abortion Care (H.1599/S.1114)| Testimony\nMassachusetts Parentage Act (H.1713/S.947) & (H.1602/SB.1130)| Testimony\nDebts & Driving Act(H.3314/S.2227)| Testimony| Learn More(Aprende más)\nHOMES Act (H.1690/S.956) | Learn More| Testimony| AdditionalTestimony\nAccess to Counsel for Evictions (H.1731/S.864) | Learn More| Testimony| AdditionalTestimony\nCommon Start: Early Education and Care (H.489/S.301) | Learn More | Testimony|Take Action!\nFairness for Agricultural Workers (H.2812/S.1837)| Testimony\nFacial Recognition Commission Recommendations(H.1728/S.927) |Learn More|Testimony|Take Action!\nFix the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (H.1440/S.1004)\nResponsible Robotics Act (H.1403/S.2483)|Learn More|Testimony\nOverdose Prevention Centers(H.1981/S.1242) | Learn More|Testimony|Take Action!\nMedication for Addiction Treatment in All Correctional Facilities (H.1967/S.1252)| Testimony\nTreatment, Not Imprisonment (H.1391/S.982)|Learn More| Testimony\nEvidence-Based Prenatal Substance Use Policy (H.173/S.64)| Testimony\nNon-Carceral Addiction Treatment for People Not Accused of Crimes (H.1966/S.1247)| Testimony\nRaise the Age (H.1710/S.942)\nSchool-Based Discipline for Court-Involved Youth (H.597/S.294)\nJuvenile Data Collection (H.1802/S.931)| Testimony\nSearch aclum.org\nContact Us\nCareers\nDonate\nACLU on Facebook\nACLU on Twitter\nACLU on Instagram\n© 2024 ACLU Massachusetts\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Statement\nWebsite Accessibility"

Depending on the state, this can be done during the regular legislative session, in a special session following the adjournment of the regular session, or during the next legislative session. The rules for legislative overrides of gubernatorial vetoes in Massachusetts are listed below.\nHow many legislators are required to vote for an override? Two-thirds of members present in both chambers.\n\"But if he have any objection to the passing of such bill or resolve, he shall return the same, together with his objections thereto, in writing, to the senate or house of representatives, in whichsoever the same shall have originated; who shall enter the objections sent down by the governor, at large, on their records, and proceed to reconsider the said bill or resolve. But if after such reconsideration, two thirds of the said senate or house of representatives, shall, notwithstanding the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall also be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of the members present, shall have the force of a law: but in all such cases, the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of the persons voting for, or against, the said bill or resolve, shall be entered upon the public records of the commonwealth.\"\nHistory\nPartisan balance 1992-2013\nSQLI and partisanship\nTo read the full report on the State Quality of Life Index (SQLI) in PDF form, click here.\nThe chart below depicts the partisanship of the Massachusetts state government and the state's SQLI ranking for the years studied. For the SQLI, the states were ranked from 1-50, with 1 being the best and 50 the worst. Massachusetts had a period of divided government between 1992 and 2006 before electing a Democratic trifecta in 2007. Between the years 1992 and 2004, Massachusetts remained in the top-10 in the SQLI ranking, hitting its highest spot (3rd) in 2000 under divided government. The state had its lowest ranking (24th) in 2006, also under divided government. During the years 2005 and 2006, Massachusetts fell eleven spots in the SQLI ranking under divided government, which was its largest drop in the ranking during the period of the study. The state has never had a Republican trifecta.\nCannabis Policy\nChildren, Families and Persons with Disabilities\nCommunity Development and Small Businesses\nConsumer Protection and Professional Licensure\nEconomic Development and Emerging Technologies\nEducation\nElder Affairs\nElection Laws\nEnvironment, Natural Resources and Agriculture\nExport Development\nFinancial Services\nHealth Care Financing\nHigher Education\nHousing\nJudiciary\nLabor and Workforce Development\nMental Health, Substance Abuse, and Recovery\nMunicipalities and Regional Government\nPublic Health\nPublic Safety and Homeland Security\nPublic Service\nRevenue\nRules\nState Administration and Regulatory Oversight\nTelecommunication, Utilities and Energy\nTourism, Arts and Cultural Development\nTransportation\nVeterans and Federal Affairs\nWays and Means\nThe following measures have been certified for the ballot.\nNo measures to list\nThe following measures have been certified for the ballot.\nNo measures to list\nThe following measures have made it through one chamber—or one session for two session states—and may appear on the ballot in 2024.\nNo measures to list\nSee also\nElections\nMassachusetts State Government\nState Legislatures\nState Politics\nMassachusetts elections, 2022\nMassachusetts elections, 2020\nMassachusetts elections, 2018\nMassachusetts State Senate\nMassachusetts House of Representatives\nGovernor of Massachusetts\nMassachusetts Supreme Court\nState legislative elections, 2022\nState legislative elections, 2021\nState legislative elections, 2020\nState legislative elections, 2019\nState legislative elections, 2018\nState government trifectas\nState government triplexes\nState executives\nState courts\nBallot measures\nExternal links\nGeneral Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nMassachusetts State Senate\nMassachusetts House of Representatives\nFootnotes\n↑ Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, \"Massachusetts Constitution,\" accessed February 12, 2021\n↑ Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, \"Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Article LXXXII,\" accessed February 12, 2021\n↑ Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, \"Massachusetts Constitution,\" accessed February 12, 2021\n↑ The Associated Press, \"Legislative leader to outline goals for 2016 session,\" January 29, 2016\n↑ State House News Service, \"DeLeo, Rosenberg won't rule out tax increases in face of budget deficit,\" January 8, 2015\n↑ The Washington Post, \"Massachusetts session preview: A full policy plate for 2014,\" January 9, 2014\n↑ The Boston Globe, \"Minimum wage battles are shifting to the states,\" January 13, 2014\n↑ Boston Herald, \"Mass. formally opens legislative session,\" January 2, 2013\n↑ Lowell Sun, \"Mass. lawmakers to weigh bill on special ed groups,\" January 4, 2012\n↑ Wicked Local Roslindale, \"Sen.
