And then a lot of rough characters used to hang around Frank Shay's Book Shop. Seamen like Will McFee, hard eggs like Johnny Weaver and Don Marquis apparently went to Frank for encouragement in their literary work. —Robert Edwards, \"The Story of Greenwich Village, Part XII\" in The Quill, January 1924\nIn Frank Shay's bookshop the boy book reviewers, newspaper columnists and juvenile cynics are defending Cabell and damning Sumner. While about the counters girls with slip-on dresses and ponderous horn glasses peep at tomes unexpurgated. —O. O. McIntyre, \"Greenwich Village\" in Cosmopolitan, January 1923\nHe went out with us and we opened the wagon for his inspection and lo, he bought books. Bought them, I say, with a hand that was as lavish as it was careful....On he went, to the ravishing delight of a bookseller's heart. —Frank Shay, \"Bookselling on the Broad Highroad\" in The New York Times Book Review, 11 May 1924\nTHE SHOP\nX\nX\nX\nX\nView larger image\nX\nCreator: Van Loon, Hendrik Willem, 1882-1944\nTitle: Envelope from the bookshop at 4 Christopher Street sent to Christopher Morley\nItem Date: 1 August 1921\nMaterial Type: Manuscript\nADA Caption: Envelope from the bookshop at 4 Christopher Street sent to Christopher Morley\nX\nView metadata\nThe bookshop's stationery, 1921\nX\nX\nView larger image\nX\nTitle: Photograph of \"Frank Shay's Bookshop\" in Bookseller and Stationer\nItem Date: 15 July 1922\nMaterial Type: Periodical\nX\nView metadata\nThe only known photograph of the shop's interior, 1922\nView page turner\nX\nCreator: Anderson, Maxwell, 1888-1959 (Editor)\nTaggard, Genevieve, 1894-1948\nTitle: The Measure: A Journal of Poetry\nDescription: First issue\nImprint: 1 (March 1921)\nItem Date: March 1921\nMaterial Type: Serials\nX\nView metadata\nThe first issue of The Measure, published at the shop in 1921\nView page turner\nX\nCreator: Millay, Edna St. Vincent, 1892-1950\nTitle: A Few Figs from Thistles: Poems and Sonnets\nDescription: Issued as Salvo One\nItem Date: 1920\nMaterial Type: Monographs\nX\nView metadata\nView page turner\nX\nCreator: Hudson, Holland Van Loon, Hendrik Willem, illustrator, 1882-1944\nTitle: \"Progressive Bookselling: Guaranteed Bookselling--One Shop and its Methods\" in Publishers Weekly\nDescription: pages 421-423\nImprint: January 1921\nItem Date: 1921\nMaterial Type: Periodical\nX\nView metadata\nAn article about the bookshop in Publishers Weekly, 1921\nX\nX\nView larger image\nX\nCreator: Morley, Christopher, 1890-1957\nTitle: Crumpets in \"Bowling Green\"\nItem Date: 8 March 1921\nMaterial Type: Scrapbooks\nADA Caption: Scrapbook of \"Bowling Green\" columns\nX\nView metadata\nChristopher Morley's \"Bowling Green\" column about eating crumpets with Frank Shay, 1921\nX\nX\nX\nX\nView slide show\nX\nX\nView metadata\nChristopher Morley baptizing \"Parnassus on Wheels\" while Frank Shay looks on, 1921\nX\nX\nX\nX\nView slide show\nX\nCreator: Unidentified photographer\nTitle: Postcard of Frank Shay and his travelling bookshop\nDescription: Inscribed on front: to Christopher Morley / source of all inspiration / Frank Shay\nInscribed on verso: ready to resume the task of running down a book buyer\nItem Date: undated\nMaterial Type: Other\nX\nView metadata\nFrank Shay with his traveling bookshop, ca. 1922\nX\nX\nX\nX\nView larger image\nX\nTitle: Greenwich Village Bookshop Circulating Library slip in a copy of Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room\nDescription: Detached from back endpapers\nImprint: New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1923\nItem Date: 1923\nMaterial Type: Monographs\nX\nView metadata\nThe bookshop's circulating library slip, 1925\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nView slide show\nX\nCreator: Schwartzburg, Molly\nTitle: Approximate location of 4 Christopher Street, June 2010\nItem Date: 2010\nMedium: Digital photograph\nMaterial Type: Photograph\nADA Caption: Photograph of 4 Christopher Street\nX\nView metadata\nThe approximate site of the bookshop, 2010\nAdmission is free\n300 West 21st StreetAustin, Texas 78712Map / Parking\n512-471-8944\nHours - Exhibitions\nTuesday–Friday 10am–5pmSaturday–Sunday Noon–5pmClosed Mondays\nHours - Reading and Viewing Room\nMonday–Saturday 9am–5pmClosed Sundays\nFollow us\non Instagram\nSubscribe to monthly eNews\nContact Us\nEmergency Information\nFacility Rental\nJobs\nSite Map\nSite Policies\nWeb Accessibility\nWeb Privacy\nSubscribe to eNews\n© Harry Ransom Center\n2023"
