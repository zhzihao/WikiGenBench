Le Monde with AP Published on December 10, 2023, at 2:41 pm (Paris) Time to 1 min. Share Share Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Linkedin Copy link Pedestrians walk past campaigners promoting candidates during the District Council elections in Hong Kong, Sunday, December 10, 2023. LOUISE DELMOTTE / AP Residents went to the polls on Sunday, December 10 in Hong Kong's first district council elections since an electoral overhaul was implemented under Beijing's guidance of \"patriots\" administering the city, effectively shutting out all pro-democracy candidates. Turnout is expected to be much lower than in the last elections, held at the height of the 2019 anti-government protests. Some pro-democracy voters, dismayed by the drastic rule changes, including the elimination of most directly elected seats, are turning their backs on the polls. Members of the League of Social Democrats, one of the city's remaining pro-democracy political parties, had planned to stage a small protest to express their discontent over the electoral rule changes. But their members were arrested by the police after being stopped and searched, the group said. The police said three people were arrested on suspicion of intending to incite others to disrupt the elections, but did not provide names. The final turnout in the vote will be a barometer of public sentiment toward the \"patriots\"-only system, the new political order under the Hong Kong government's crackdown on dissidents following the 2019 protests — the most concerted challenge to Beijing since the former British colony returned to China’s rule in 1997. China promised the semi-autonomous territory could retain its Western-style liberties for 50 years under the \"one country, two systems\" framework. But that promise has become increasingly threadbare after Beijing imposed a national security law that led to the arrest and silencing of many pro-democracy activists. Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés At the 'Hong Kong 47' trial, almost all the pro-democracy opposition was in the dock In 2021, the city amended its electoral laws for its legislature, drastically reducing the public's ability to vote and increasing the number of pro-Beijing lawmakers making decisions for the city. After the changes, the turnout rate plunged from 58% to 30% in a legislative election that year. The district councils, which primarily handle municipal matters such as organizing construction projects and public facilities, were the last major political bodies mostly chosen by the public. Partner service Learn French with Gymglish Thanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day. Try for free The elections four years ago held symbolic importance in the anti-government movement, with a record turnout rate of 71%. The pro-democracy camp’s landslide victory acted as a rebuke to the government’s handling of the 2019 protests. But an amendment passed in July slashed the proportion of directly elected seats from some 90% to about 20% — a level even lower than when the bodies were first introduced in the 1980s under British rule. A new nomination requirement has effectively resulted in the exclusion of pro-democracy candidates from the elections for the first time in about four decades.

It is pointless to vote in such a fully controlled, gamed system devised by the Beijing regime and Hong Kong authorities,” Lau told Al Jazeera.\n“It is totally pointless because they are trying to use this so-called election to build their legitimacy for their autocratic acts as well as the suppression of civil liberties, destruction of rule of law and the international promises under the Sino-British joint declaration.”\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network"
