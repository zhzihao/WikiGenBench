That means the NBA had to pack up to six games per day over the span of a couple weeks — a beautiful sight for basketball fans.MORE: Watch select NBA games live with fuboTV (7-day free trial)National TV broadcasts of the NBA games from the Orlando bubble will be shown by four different networks — ABC, ESPN, TNT, NBATV —and Friday's schedule features the first of a handful of ESPN doubleheaders. And those whohave access toNBATV as well as ESPN will be treated to a national TV tripleheader Friday.Here is a complete TV schedule for the first two nights of NBA games during the 2020 season restart, including start times and channels for Thursday and Friday's national broadcasts.NBA games todayTNT landed the high-profile Western Conference matchup of Lakers vs. Clippers on Thursday night, but ESPN gets Celtics vs. Bucks as an Eastern Conference showcase to kick off its Friday doubleheader. Rockets vs. Mavericks will be a nice night cap for the network.Friday, July 31 Game Time(ET) National TV Magic vs. Nets 2:30 p.m. — Grizzlies vs. Trail Blazers 4 p.m. NBA TV, fuboTV Suns vs. Wizards 4 p.m. — Celtics vs. Bucks 6:30 p.m. ESPN Kings vs. Spurs 8 p.m. — Rockets vs. Mavericks 9 p.m. ESPN How to watch, live stream NBA gamesESPN and TNT are available fromalmost all United States cable providers, but NBATV is only offered byVerizon (channels 89 and 589) and Comcast (channels 734 and 478).For those who have ESPN and TNT included in their cable/satellite subscriptions, live stream presentations of those networks'NBA games can be found on the ESPN app and the Watch TNT app, respectively.For those who don't have a cable or satellite subscription, there are fourmajor OTT TV streaming options that carry both ESPN and TNT— Sling, Hulu, YouTubeTVand AT&T Now. Of the four, Hulu andYouTubeTVofferfree trial options.Below are links to each. Sling Hulu(free trial) YouTubeTV(free trial) AT&T Now Of the four services, Hulu is the only one that does not carry NBATV. FuboTV carries NBATV but not ESPN or TNT.All NBA seeding games played in Orlandoalso will be available to steam via NBA League Pass at a reduced price ($28.99) since there are so few games left in the season. However, games on NBA League Pass are blacked out in local markets.NBA schedule 2020The full 2020 NBA regular-season schedule, including tip-off times and TV channels,is listed below by date.Times and TV channels for the final two days of seeding games have not yet been revealed.July 30 Game Time (ET) National TV Jazz vs. Pelicans 6:30 p.m. TNT Clippers vs. Lakers 9 p.m. TNT July 31 Game Time(ET) National TV Magic vs. Nets 2:30 p.m. — Grizzlies vs. Trail Blazers 4 p.m. NBA TV Suns vs. Wizards 4 p.m. — Celtics vs. Bucks 6:30 p.m. ESPN Kings vs. Spurs 8 p.m. — Rockets vs. Mavericks 9 p.m. ESPN Aug. 1 Game Time(ET) National TV Heat vs. Nuggets 1 p.m. ESPN Jazz vs. Thunder 3:30 p.m. ESPN Pelicans vs. Clippers 6 p.m. ESPN 76ers vs. Pacers 7 p.m. — Lakers vs. Raptors 8:30 p.m. ESPN Aug. 2 Game Time(ET) National TV Wizards vs. Nets 2 p.m. — Trail Blazers vs. Celtics 3:30 p.m. ABC Spurs vs. Grizzlies 4 p.m. — Kings vs. Magic 6 p.m. NBA TV Bucks vs. Rockets 8:30 p.m. ABC Mavericks vs. Suns 9 p.m. — Aug. 3 Game Time(ET) National TV Raptors vs. Heat 1:30 p.m. NBA TV Nuggets vs. Thunder 4 p.m. NBA TV Pacers vs. Wizards 4 p.m. — Grizzlies vs. Pelicans 6:30 p.m. ESPN Spurs vs. 76ers 8 p.m. — Lakers vs. Jazz 9 p.m. ESPN Aug. 4 Game Time(ET) National TV Nets vs. Bucks 1:30 p.m. NBA TV Mavericks vs. Kings 2:30 p.m. — Suns vs. Clippers 4 p.m. NBA TV Magic vs. Pacers 6 p.m. — Celtics vs. Heat 6:30 p.m. TNT Rockets vs. Trail Blazers 9 p.m. TNT Aug. 5 Game Time(ET) National TV Grizzlies vs. Jazz 2:30 p.m. — 76ers vs. Wizards 4 p.m. NBA TV Nuggets vs. Spurs 4 p.m. — Thunder vs. Lakers 6:30 p.m. ESPN Raptors vs. Magic 8 p.m. — Nets vs. Celtics 9 p.m. ESPN Aug. 6 Game Time(ET) National TV Pelicans vs. Kings 1:30 p.m. NBA TV Heat vs. Bucks 4 p.m. TNT Pacers vs. Suns 4 p.m. — Clippers vs. Mavericks 6:30 p.m. TNT Trail Blazers vs. Nuggets 8 p.m. — Lakers vs. Rockets 9 p.m. TNT Aug. 7 Game Time(ET) National TV Jazz vs. Spurs 1 p.m. — Thunder vs. Grizzlies 4 p.m. NBA TV Kings vs. Nets 5 p.m. — Magic vs. 76ers 6:30 p.m. TNT Wizards vs. Pelicans 8 p.m. — Celtics vs. Raptors 9 p.m. TNT Aug. 8 Game Time(ET) National TV Clippers vs. Trail Blazers 1 p.m. TNT Jazz vs. Nuggets 3:30 p.m. TNT Lakers vs. Pacers 6 p.m. TNT Suns vs. Heat 7:30 p.m. — Bucks vs. Mavericks 8:30 p.m. ESPN Aug. 9 Game Time(ET) National TV Wizards vs. Thunder 12:30 p.m. — Grizzlies vs. Raptors 2 p.m. — Spurs vs. Pelicans 3 p.m. ABC Magic vs. Celtics 5 p.m. — 76ers vs. Trail Blazers 6:30 p.m. NBA TV Rockets vs. Kings 8 p.m. — Nets vs. Clippers 9 p.m. NBA TV Aug. 10 Game Time(ET) National TV Thunder vs. Suns 2:30 p.m. — Mavericks vs. Jazz 3 p.m. NBA TV Raptors vs. Bucks 6:30 p.m. ESPN Pacers vs. Heat 8 p.m. — Nuggets vs. Lakers 9 p.m. TNT Aug. 11 Game Time(ET) National TV Nets vs. Magic 1 p.m. — Rockets vs. Spurs 2 p.m. NBA TV Suns vs. 76ers 4:30 p.m. — Trail Blazers vs. Mavericks 5 p.m. — Celtics vs. Grizzlies 6:30 p.m. TNT Pelicans vs. Kings 9 p.m. TNT Bucks vs. Wizards 9 p.m. — Aug. 12 Game Time(ET) National TV Pacers vs. Rockets 4 p.m. NBA TV Raptors vs. 76ers 6:30 p.m. ESPN Heat vs. Thunder 8 p.m. — Clippers vs. Nuggets 9 p.m. ESPN Aug. 13 Game Time(ET) National TV Wizards vs. Celtics TBD TBD Trail Blazers vs. Nets TBD TBD Kings vs. Lakers TBD TBD Bucks vs. Grizzlies TBD TBD Pelicans vs. Magic TBD TBD Mavericks vs. Suns TBD TBD Spurs vs. Jazz TBD TBD Aug. 14 Game Time(ET) National TV 76ers vs. Rockets TBD TBD Heat vs. Pacers TBD TBD Thunder vs. Clippers TBD TBD Nuggets vs. Raptors TBD TBD\nTadd Haislop\nNBA\nBasketball\nSection: NBA\nMilwaukee Bucks v Boston Celtics\nOrlando Magic\nDallas Mavericks\nBrooklyn Nets\nBoston Celtics\nMilwaukee Bucks\nPhoenix Suns\nSan Antonio Spurs\nPortland Trail Blazers\nMemphis Grizzlies\nBrooklyn Nets v Orlando Magic\nDallas Mavericks v Houston Rockets\nWashington Wizards v Phoenix Suns\nSan Antonio Spurs v Sacramento Kings\nPortland Trail Blazers v Memphis Grizzlies\nSacramento Kings\nHouston Rockets\nWashington Wizards\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\nPrivacy Policy\nSporting News | All Rights Reserved | Copyright 2024"

Thank you so much for taking some time out of your day to come visit tamirmoore.blogspot.com.\nThis website, tamirmooreblogspot.com, was primarily designed by me to provide me a place to produce regular articles regarding sports announcers that you see calling the games on television.\nWriting is something that I has always loved to do since I was a little kid. And this blog was the perfect platform to share my immeasurable love for sports with all of you.\nWith that in mind, I personally invite you to take the time to go through the various articles that I wrote throughout the course of this blog's history (2015-present).\nIf you read a particular article and find something of interest to you, please do not hesitate to leave a comment on that article!\nFurthermore, all comments on this website have to be approved by me before I permit the comments to be posted for the entire website community to see. The reason for this is because people assume that this blog is like a sound-off box, meaning that you can basically say whatever comes to mind without any rational thinking or consideration whatsoever.\nHowever, I will not tolerate any form or disrespectful behavior or unfair/unjust vitrol criticism on this website at all.\n~ Tamir Moore, Administrator & Author/tamirmooreblogspot.com"
