It also remains a major partner when humanitarian assistance is necessary, with a new allocation of 25 million EUR confirmed for the year 2023 to address the needs of most vulnerable Mozambicans.\nAbout Copernicus\nMORE STORIES\nSTORY\nMozambique Update: EU Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World 2022\n17.08.2023\nSTORY\n03.07.2023\nSTORY\nHumanitarian Assistance: EU committed to supporting Mozambique and its people\n27.04.2023\nSTORY\nInformation on ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System)\n24.03.2023\nSTORY\nMozambique: European Union allocates emergency aid for victims of storm Freddy\n02.03.2023\nSee more\nBack to top\nEUROPEAN UNION WEBSITES\nEuropean Union\n|\nEuropean Commission\n|\nEuropean Parliament\n|\nEuropean Council\n|\nAll EU Institutions\nContacts\nData protection\nPrivacy statements\nCookie policy\nEuropa analytics\nLanguage policy\nLegal notice\nAccessibility\nLogin"
