Cole and MJF successfully defended the titles and opened the show with an entertaining performance.Winners: MJF and Adam ColeGrade: BNotable Moments and ObservationsThe Dark Order had a cool entrance for this match.MJF's handshake fake so he can poke his opponent in the eyes is one of those things that you can't help but laugh at even though you know it's coming.The jumping kick Cole hit as Silver tried to hit a suicide dive looked incredible.The Kangaroo Kick is so dumb that it's great.Samoa Joe vs. Shayne Taylor (ROH TV Title)3 of 12Samoa Joe.AEWAs Samoa Joe made his way to the ring, he passed Cole and MJF on the ramp. He made MJF angry, so the AEW champion attacked him and caused a pull-apart brawl. Joe almost looked happy that he got into MJF's head.Joe went on to defend his ROH TV title against Shayne Taylor. The two big men immediately started throwing heavy hands at each other.These are two guys who pride themselves on being versatile powerhouses, so we saw more than just punches and slams in this match. They used a wide variety of offense to inflict damage.After a great fight, Joe was able to secure the win by submission to retain his title. This match wasn't too long, but it was just long enough to accomplish what they wanted to do. This was the definition of \"Big meaty men slapping meat.\"Winner: Samoa JoeGrade: B+Notable Moments and ObservationsIt wasn't super clear why MJF got upset other than Joe coming out earlier than expected. It was later revealed that this was a reference to a WWE segment that took place several years ago.Taylor has one of the best jabs in pro wrestling. He can hit them rapid-fire and make it look real.Luchasaurus vs. Darby Allin (TNT Title) 4 of 12Darby Allin.AEWDarby Allin was hoping his back injuries from All In wouldn't be too detrimental as he stepped into the ring to challenge Luchasaurus for the TNT Championships.As usual, Christian Cage was there with his protege, but Nick Wayne was also at ringside to support Allin.As soon as the match started, the Living Dinosaur took control. He used his superior power to decimate the risk-taker with brutal offense.This almost wasn't a match. It was a mauling. It's hard to remember the last time Allin spent this much time being put through the wringer before he made a comeback.The challenger eventually found his second wind, but he was immediately flattened when he tried to dive into Luchasaurus and made almost no impact other than his own body hitting the mat.The match was more competitive after that, but it was still mostly Luchasaurus controlling the pace while Allin would get in short bursts of offense. Christian threatened to hit Wayne with a chair to distract Allin long enough for Luchasaurus to hit two tombstones and a clothesline for the win.Winner: LuchasaurusGrade: B-Notable Moments and ObservationsLuchasaurus has music that is very reminiscent of Kane's entrance music.The way Luchasaurus swung Allin into the steel steps looked nasty.It looks like Allin was busted open when his head was kicked into the steel steps.Christian being obsessed with mocking people who have dead fathers is such a weird and specific gimmick, but it seems to be working for him.Darby almost landed on the top of his head after a German suplex.Miro vs. Powerhouse Hobbs5 of 12All Out.AEWOur second hoss fight of the night saw Miro take on a man who is just as big and just as mean, Powerhouse Hobbs.These guys are relatively evenly matched in size, power and speed, so neither competitor was able to control the other for too long before the tide shifted.Much like Joe vs. Taylor, this match was the epitome of big meaty men slapping meat. If Big E was watching this show, he was having a great time.Hobbs and Miro did a great job pacing themselves, but there were moments when it felt like the crowd was just waiting for the next move to happen because AEW action is usually so fast-paced.All Elite Wrestling @AEWMEAT FOREVER!üëèüëèüëè\nMEAT FOREVER!üëèüëèüëè\nMEAT FOREVER!üëèüëèüëè"

However, in the eyes of adversity, the wrestlers of AEW came together and delivered when it mattered most.It was a hot card from top to bottom at All Out inside the United Center, as grudges got solved in the ring and various titles were on the line. Only one title changed hands, and it came at the expense of what may be 2023‚Äôs Wrestler of the Year.After over 31 successful title defenses and 326 days as AEW International Champion, Orange Cassidy got dethroned by Blackpool Combat Club‚Äôs Jon Moxley. Cassidy, who has gone through so much during his time as champion, finally met his match against a blood-thirsty Moxley, who did everything to break the tired Cassidy.Cassidy used fan support and adrenaline to come back at several points. It wasn't enough, as the former AEW World Champion beat him to add more gold to his collection.The ‚Äúlazy‚Äù wrestler from ‚Äúwherever,‚Äù Cassidy was chastised for his style when he first came to AEW. To quote Cody Rhodes, he quickly grew on people and went from undesirable to undeniable. Now, he can finally get some rest.MORE:WWE's merger with Endeavor Group, explainedThe entire card had an Event of the Year feel to it.Outside of ‚ÄúHangman‚Äù Adam Page in the Over Budget Battle Royale, the other members of The Elite lost their bouts. The Young Bucks, who received mixed reactions from the Chicago crowd, teamed with FTR and lost against Bullet Club Gold.Meanwhile, for the first time in over a decade, Kenny Omega and Konosuke Takeshita faced off, and they delivered. Both focused on the neck of the other, and they put on a Strong Style bout that many expected after months of tension. Takeshita beat Omega in a star-making performance, fulfilling fans' wishes when he first joined AEW.Bryan Danielson, who came back a month early following an injury suffered at Forbidden Door, beat Ricky Starks (who was meant to face Punk at the event) in a Strap match.The Final Countdown is reverberating throughout the United Center and the American Dragon Bryan Danielson makes his return to the ring right now!Order #AEWAllOut on PPV right now!üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/fDofZ563Cvüîó https://t.co/iawFge9Cal@bryandanielson pic.twitter.com/vz2bogUnEL‚Äî All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) September 4, 2023Like his last match against Kazuchika Okada, Danielson came out to ‚ÄúThe Final Countdown,‚Äù meaning business was about to pick up. Wearing a noticeable cast, Danielson beat Starks after the two bloodied one another and interference from Ricky ‚ÄúThe Dragon‚Äù Steamboat.One of the best matches of the evening involved Miro and Powerhouse Hobbs. The big men had an entertaining clash, so much so that the crowd had fun with it, chanting ‚ÄúMeat‚Äù any chance they got.After plenty of back-and-forth action, Miro beat Hobbs. Post-match, Miro reunited with his with CJ Perry (the former Lana in WWE).Walking away from her, it is unknown what this Miro-Perry interaction means for the future of AEW.Away from the future, AEW went back to the past to open the show.AEW World Champion MJF and Adam Cole successfully defended the ROH World Tag Team Titles against Dark Order.MJF & Samoa Joe are going head to head before Joe's #ROH World TV Title match!Order #AEWAllOut on PPV right now!üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/fDofZ563Cvüîó https://t.co/iawFge9Cal@The_MJF | @SamoaJoe pic.twitter.com/W4SCk5M4rD‚Äî All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) September 4, 2023Following the match, Samoa Joe came out for his bout against Shane Taylor and bumped into MJF, similar to when MJF was a security guard for Joe in NXT. The two brawled in and out of the ring.It is safe to assume MJF and Joe have unfinished business.Also on the card, Kris Statlander successfully defended the TBS Title against Ruby Soho after Outcast member Toni Storm turned on Soho. Eddie Kingston and Claudio Castagnoli continued their rivalry when Claudio and Wheeler beat Kingston and Katsuyori Shibata.And in one of the biggest shocks of the night, Luchasaurus beat Darby Allin to retain the AEW TNT Title.Before the show, Dennis Rodman, the former Chicago Bull and NWO member, landed a guitar shot on Jeff Jarrett‚Äôs team, helping The Acclaimed retain the AEW World Trios Titles.RODZILLA STRIKES AGAIN!Watch #AEWAllOut Zero Hour right now!‚ñ∂Ô∏è https://t.co/274aEdPlSl@PlatinumMax | @Bowens_Official | @RealBillyGunn | @dennisrodman pic.twitter.com/HATPQM2dIW‚Äî All Elite Wrestling (@AEW) September 3, 2023AEW All Out 2023 full card resultsJon Moxley def.Orange Cassidy (c)to becomethe AEW International ChampionBullet Club Gold (Austin Gunn, Colten Gunn, Jay White, and Juice Robinson) def.
