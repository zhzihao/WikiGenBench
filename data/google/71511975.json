The analysis by the Commission (Joint Research Centre) and European Environment Agency identifies the likely causes and proposes recommendations to help prevent such catastrophes from happening again.Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, said:The 2022 Oder River fish kill was a stark reminder of how human induced pollution, coupled with biodiversity loss and climate change, can create a perfect storm, with dire consequences for people, the economy and planet. We cannot allow a similar disasterto ever happen again.We need ourriversfor fresh drinking water,ourlivelihoods andour ecosystems.Iwarmlywelcome this new reportand invite competent national authorities torigorouslyimplement itsrecommendations.The full implementation of thecurrent legislation and our proposed improvementsto EU lawsonindustrial emissions,surface and ground water pollutants and treatment of urban wastewater will be our shield againstsuch disasters in the future.According to the scientific evidence in the report, the deaths of around 360 tonnes of fish were caused by a substantial toxic algal bloom identified as Prymnesium parvum. A key factor that enabled the proliferation of this brackish water species is most likely the high salinity of the Oder River during this time, resulting from discharges of industrial wastewater with a high salt content e.g. from industrial activities such as mining.Other contributing factors were the drought and the resulting low water levels reducing dilution and flow. Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially phosphorus and nitrogen, are also a key component in promoting such blooms.Given the continued presence and spread of this invasive algal species, management strategies to prevent future occurrence of events of this nature must now be prioritised not only in the Oder catchment but also in other susceptible European river basin districts, which the report indicates.The prevention of future disasters is one of the commitments the EU will be bringing forward at the forthcoming landmark UN Water Conference in March. Indeed, recent legislative proposals from the Commission will serve to strengthen even further existing EU environmental legislation. Emissions to water from large industrial installations are regulated by the Industrial Emissions Directive, which the Commission has proposed to strengthen to further reduce emissions to water and air. The Commission’s proposal to strengthen the law on treatment of wastewater will contribute further to preventing nutrient pollution and resulting algae blooms, when adopted. In the event of future pollution incidents, the Commission’s proposal on water pollutants, includes a mandatory warning clause.The report highlights key recommendations to prevent future ecological disasters in EU rivers:Improve knowledge and monitoring.Improve proactive communication to stakeholders, public and countries downstream.Improve response and risk management (anticipate responses and prepare resources).Review and verify existing permits and increase enforcement.Introduce provisions for allowable pollutant loads to be adapted to the water levels in the recipient waters.List all industrial discharges in a complete and up to date public inventory of emissions (European Industrial Emissions Portal (europa.eu).Further investigate the source of the incident (while a multifactorial event, sources of discharges of saline material should be identified and checked against permits, compare to long term salinity levels).Improve environmental management (hydromorphological changes, salinity /nutrient thresholds).Start restoration (inventory of damage, develop plan for restoration of the river).Undertakeresearch to improve knowledge and help prevent algae growth and salinisation.\nDetails\nPublication date17 February 2023AuthorDirectorate-General for Environment\nEU Environment newsletter\nEU Environment newsletters deliver the latest updates about the European Commission’s environmental priorities straight to your inbox.See more\nShare this page\nEnvironmentThis site is managed by: Directorate-General for EnvironmentContact usContact DG EnvironmentFollow usTwitterFacebookInstagramYouTubeLinkedInAbout usAbout usAccessibilityRelated sitesAgricultureFisheriesClimate actionEnergyEuropean Climate PactMore information on:Energy, Climate change, EnvironmentContact the European CommissionFollow the European Commission on social mediaResources for partnersLanguages on our websitesCookiesPrivacy policyLegal notice"

He is also concerned about more blooms of the alga. “We are afraid that the reduction in filtration activity will favour future mass developments of Prymnesium,” he says.\nThe Oder needs to go into “intensive care” to prevent further blooms, says Free, with urgent work required to tackle industrial pollution along the river and reduce nutrient loads. For example, authorities should be able to pause industrial discharges of salty waste when the threat of an algal bloom is high, the JRC recommends.\nOthers believe a wholesale change in the rules governing industrial discharges will be necessary to protect river health in the future, especially as European summers become hotter and drier under climate change. Discharge licences need to be rewritten with the impacts of climate change in mind, says Borchardt. “We have to ask if the permissions, for example, for the wastewater release, are sufficient under conditions of climate change,” he says. “My guess is they are not.”\nReference: JRC Publications Repository, DOI: 10.2760/067386\nTopics:pollution/rivers\nAdvertisement\nSign up to our weekly newsletter\nReceive a weekly dose of discovery in your inbox!\nWe'll also keep you up to date with New Scientist\nevents and special offers.\nSign up\nMore from New Scientist\nExplore the latest news, articles and features\nEnvironment\nHow can you tell if a river in the UK is healthy?\nNewsFree\nEnvironment\nSave Britain’s Rivers: Why we’re campaigning to rescue UK waterways\nLeaderFree\nEnvironment\nHow a Cotswolds river may show the way to clean up England's waterways\nNewsSubscriber-only\nEnvironment\nEarth's vital rivers captured in stunning drone and satellite images\nRegularsFree\nPopular articles\nTrending New Scientist articles\n1\nWe finally know how tardigrades can survive extreme conditions\n2\n3\nHow fall of Bronze Age civilisations holds lessons for modern world\n4\nHumans first reached China thousands of years earlier than we thought\n5\n6\nSeabed trawling found to be a major source of global CO2 emissions\n7\nLeave no stone unturned in search for an explanation of consciousness\n8\nKimchi and artisan cheeses can contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria\n9\nSperm counts are down worldwide and researchers are discovering why\n10\nScientists created a ‘giant quantum vortex’ that mimics a black hole\nAdvertisement\nDownload the app\nFind us on social media\nInstagram\nFacebook\nX / Twitter\nTiktok\nLinkedIn\nSubscriptions\nSubscriber benefits\nGift\nStudent & graduate\nEducational\nCorporate\nSupport\nHelp\nAbout us\nAdvertise\nWrite for us\nTools\nEvents\nScience Jobs\nCoLab\nSyndication\nRSS feeds\nLegal and privacy\nContact us\nPrivacy policy\nCookie policy\nTerms & conditions\nCookie Settings\n© Copyright New Scientist Ltd.\nBack to the top"

(Frank Hammerschmidt/dpa via AP, File)WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Greenpeace environmental group said Thursday that wastewater discharge from Poland’s coal mines was most likely responsible for the 2022 massive fish die-off in the Oder River.Greenpeace Poland also warned that the situation may reoccur this year and also hit Poland's largest river, the Vistula, if the government and the coalmining industry don't take immediate steps to counter the problem. The fish die-out was blamed on deadly type of algae, Prymnesium parvum, that thrives in highly salty water and in hot temperatures.The group presented results from their salinity levels tests in the Oder and Vistula Rivers that showed that the levels shot up, sometimes off the scale, after the rivers' waters travel through Poland's southern coalmining region of Silesia.“Our hypothesis is that the source of the high salinity levels are most probably brine waters pumped from Upper Silesia into the Oder and the Vistula,” said the author of the tests and a Greenpeace expert, Leszek Pazderski of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun.Greenpeace warned that this situation may result again in the deaths of hundreds of tons of fish if nothing is done. The group called on the government to establish a national park reserve on parts of the Oder to protect it from industrial contamination and to introduce much more restrictive discharge regulations. Greenpeace also indicated that the mining industry should invest in proper filtering of its wastewater.Political CartoonsView All 253 ImagesPoland's government insisted last year that all regulations had been observed and blamed the disaster on natural causes like high temperatures and drought, which drastically brought river water levels down, further increasing salination.An analysis by European Union experts published last month said that the disaster was at least partly due to the discharge of industrial wastewater with high salt content, like in the case of coal mining.The analysis said the die-out in the Oder last July and August was one of the “largest ecological disasters in recent European river history.”Copyright 2023 TheAssociated Press.

More than one year later, the river is in peril again. The decisions taken by the previous government have so far only exacerbated the situation. Now, a new government offers one last opportunity to show environmental stewardship and reverse the catastrophe.\nRafał Rykowski, Biodiversity campaigner, Polish Green Network|1 December 2023\nJacek Engel, Fundacja Greenmind\nTheme: Biodiversity | Oder river\nLocation: Poland\nProject: EU funds and biodiversity\nGet in touch with us\nEmailFacebookInstagramLinkedInRSSTwitterYouTube\nIf you turn cookies off, It won’t affect the user’s experience .Close"

Photo shared by Virginijus Sinkevičius / @EU_Commission Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries / Twitter_\nOther contributing factors were the drought and resulting low water levels reducing dilution and flow and also hydromorphological modifications to the river. High nutrient concentrations, especially phosphorus and nitrogen, are also key in promoting such blooms.\nThe river is one of Europe’s 20 large rivers and is valuable to the livelihoods of and recreation of the 16 million people residing in its catchment area and beyond, the authors of the report noted. “It also serves as a focus for nature preservation with numerous Natura 2000 sites locatedalong its length.”\nIt originates in the Czech Republic, flows through western Poland, forms the border betweenPoland and Germany, then drains north to the Szczecin Lagoon near Szczecin.\nThe West Pomeranian region was among those that recorded the largest fish kills, mostly occurring over a 12 day period in mid-August. Apart from fish, aquatic organisms like freshwaterbivalves and other molluscs alongside the mortality of birds, ducks, beavers and otherWildlife were also impacted, the EU wrote in the latest report.\nAffected areas in the Oder river\nवन्यजीवएवंजैवविविधता\nसे जुड़ी सभी खबरें हिंदी में पढ़ें।\noder river\naquatic ecosystem\nalgal bloom\nIndustrial effluent\nFish Poisoning\nfish deaths\nwest pomerian\nWildlife & Biodiversity\nWorld\nSubscribe to Daily Newsletter :\nSUPPORT US\nPost a Comment\nNEXT STORY\nYoung Environmentalist\nNews\nIn-depth\nExtreme Weather\nVideos\nBook Store\nAfrica\nClimate\nAgriculture\nGobar Times\nडाउन टू अर्थ\nDownload Print Archives\nAir Pollution\nData Centre\nBlogs\nIndia\nWorld\nCoronavirus\nEnvironment\nAgriculture\nWater\nFood\nNatural Disasters\nWaste\nEnergy\nWildlife & Biodiversity\nEconomy\nScience & Technology\nForests\nHealth\nCartoons\nBook Reviews\nInterviews\nHoneygate"
