        "text": "Prima la televisione\nC’è però un’ultima evoluzione che i visual album sembrano aver intrapreso, un’evoluzione naturale e quasi ovvia: la televisione. O meglio, quella che ormai è considerata la nuova televisione, e cioè lo streaming. Nelle ultime settimane sui due principali player del settore, Netflix e Prime, sono comparsi due progetti di Beyoncé e Donald Glover, due degli alfieri della rivoluzione culturale black. Beyoncé ha presentato “Homecoming”, un documentario/riassunto della sua monumentale esibizione al Coachella di qualche anno fa. Pezzi di storia nera uniti al racconto della preparazione dello show, oltre che la quasi totale proiezione dello show. L’operazione tentata da Glover (alias Childish Gambino) è diversa: “Guava Island” è una sorta di musical atipico, un mediometraggio con una trama semplice, intervallato dall’esecuzione di alcuni dei suoi ultimi brani.\nmusica\ncinema\nvideo\ntelevisione\nserie tv\nnetflix\nbeyoncé\nI più letti di Cultura\nLa recensione\nSe l'importante non è capire, ma trasformare la propria vita in un racconto\n“Elizabeth Finch”, il nuovo romanzo di Julian Barnes chegioca a moltiplicare storie e allusionitraletteratura,filosofia e realtà\nMarco Archetti\n18 GEN 2024\nl'intervista\nSecondo lo scrittore e pensatore, tra i più brillanti della destra,l'ex segretario del Partito comunistanon può far parte della tradizione dell'ideologia italiana.

While Sia built her mainstream success on her pro songwriting chops and visually arrested music videos featuring dancer Maddie Ziegler, casting the neurotypical Ziegler as a neurodivergent girl drew immediate criticism. The girl's name is Music, and the film's many musical numbers take place inside her head, often on monochromatic sets with flat, unengaging cinematography. The non-musical sequences have Kate Hudson's drug-dealing character Zu (short for Kazu, mind you) deal with the responsibilities of taking care of Music while running errands for her dealer (Ben Schwartz in cornrows for some reason), and the whole thing is just a mess. Add in Sia making a cameo as herself, and it's clear that \"Music\" is one of the most overly indulgent, horrendous projects a musician has ever tied themselves to.\nParas Griffin/Getty Images\nTodrick Hall is very used to doing what he wants by having few people tell him \"no.\" While this means the singing, dancing, and always-online personality has been fiercely independent, it also means he's able to snag superstar appearances for projects with half-baked ideas. \"Forbidden\", his second visual album, tries to make a too-obvious point about oppression by flipping binaries. Set in the fictional town of Nacirema Falls, where every couple is Black and gay, \"straightophobia\" is frowned upon, and a white kid walking in the neighborhood is needlessly gunned down by a Black police officer with no consequences. As a societal critique, it feels forced, and when shoe-horned in between music videos filmed for other singles, it gets even weaker (to say nothing of not one but two songs bragging about his wealth). Snagging big names like Cynthia Erivo, Jenifer Lewis, and Tiffany Haddish is no easy feat, but their talents are lost in this lopsided narrative that's nonetheless presented in bright colors and tight choreography. During the film's dramatic final act, Todrick Hall busts out some of the most passionate vocal takes he's ever recorded, but it's all in service of a story that should've gone through several drafts before ever being filmed.\n13 of 50\n#38: Michael Jackson – \"Moonwalker\" (1988)\n14 of 50\n#37: The Beatles – \"Help!\" (1965)\n23 of 50\n#28: Halsey – \"If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power\" (2021)\n? Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY\nAlways referring to her music videos as \"emotion pictures,\" Janelle Monáe is exactly the kind of artist whose vision would lend itself easily to the visual album format. Turning into full \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" mode, Monáe plays her longtime character Jane, here having her memories wiped so she can grow up \"properly\" in heteronormative cyber-society. Each memory is its own standalone music video, and Tessa Thompson plays a former lover who is now an administrator of the process that cleans \"dirty computers\" such as Jane. While the \"Dirty Computer\" album is by far Monáe's most obvious attempt at accessible pop music, its best songs so often conjure the best visuals, ranging from the playfully assertive feminism of \"Pynk\" to the stark militant raps of \"Django Jane\". Not every individual track works (sorry, \"Screwed\"), but the overarching narrative and clear star power at play help make this computer feel like an upgrade over most album-length visuals.\n30 of 50\n#21: Kate Bush – \"The Line, the Cross & the Curve\" (1993)\n31 of 50\n#20: Sturgill Simpson – \"...Presents Sound & Fury\" (2021)\n33 of 50\n#18: Kanye West – \"Runaway\" (2010)\n35 of 50\n#16: Justin Bieber – \"PURPOSE : The Movement\" (2015)\nAnders Deros / Aftonbladet / TT /Sipa USA\nSolange Knowles has had several careers within her own career, having careened from disposable pop to forward-thinking R&B. Yet 2016's \"A Seat at the Table\" rewrote her narrative, reintroducing her to the world as a wise-beyond-her-years songwriter with craft and creativity so spare, with much of that soulful insight also bleeding into her distinct music videos. While 2019's \"When I Get Home\" is arguably a more ambitious record than \"Seat\" (and having received a far more mixed response than its predecessor), it was accompanied by a wild film that integrated many of the songs into a kaleidoscope of semi-connected images and scenes. Its ambition exceeds its grasp, but when \"When I Get Home\" focuses on celebrating and recontextualizing Black culture, it finds its true voice. These usually come in the form of contrasts, like when she shows Black cowboys riding broncos next to a white guy doing lasso tricks, immediately making one challenge notions they have of traditional Western history. It's not perfect, but \"When I Get Home\" points to Solange's continued refinement of her fascinating, confident, and often breathtaking worldview.\nColumbia Pictures\nHow does one even begin to describe \"Tommy\"? While the classic 1969 rock opera from The Who tells the story of a \"deaf, dumb and blind\" boy who eventually becomes a savant at playing pinball and later becomes a cult leader, many wondered if the challenging narrative could even be adapted for film. With the help of writer/director Ken Russell, \"Tommy\" ended up being a pure psychedelic fantasy with visuals that you won't soon forget. Featuring an Oscar-nominated performance by Ann-Margret as Tommy's mother (who has an unforgettable encounter with some baked beans), the music and production design absolutely sing; the only letdown being that while Roger Daltrey still gives it his all as the title character, many of the other roles are filled out by other actors, and few (even Elton John!) can't hold a candle to the band's originals. Well, that is, of course, except for Tina Turner, who makes \"The Acid Queen\" her own and is worth the price of admission alone.\n38 of 50\n#13: iamamiwhoami – \"blue\" (2014)\n44 of 50\n#7: iamamiwhoami – \"bounty\" (2013)\n45 of 50\n#6: Pink Floyd – \"The Wall\" (1982)\nCatching feelings: 25 songs about crushing on someone\nEA Sports won't commit to release date for widely anticipated 'NCAA Football' game\nThe 50 greatest Beatles songs\nTrending in Entertainment\nThe 26 funniest space movies of all time\nThe 50 most-memorable quotes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nThe best and worst comic book movies outside the Marvel or DC universes\nCatching feelings: 25 songs about crushing on someone\nThe 50 greatest Beatles songs\n20 celebrities who admitted to dating fans\nThe best final lines from movies\n21st-century cartoon characters that are already iconic\nCustomize Your Newsletter\n+"
