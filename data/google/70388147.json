She’s the right one for me.” 4(His parents did not know that this was from the Lord,(G) who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines;(H) for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)(I) 5Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him. 6The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him(J) so that he tore the lion apart(K) with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done. 7Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her. 8Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion’s carcass, and in it he saw a swarm of bees and some honey. 9He scooped out the honey with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion’s carcass. 10Now his father went down to see the woman. And there Samson held a feast,(L) as was customary for young men. 11When the people saw him, they chose thirty men to be his companions. 12“Let me tell you a riddle,(M)” Samson said to them. “If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast,(N) I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.(O) 13If you can’t tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.”“Tell us your riddle,” they said. “Let’s hear it.” 14He replied,“Out of the eater, something to eat;out of the strong, something sweet.”(P)For three days they could not give the answer. 15On the fourth day, they said to Samson’s wife, “Coax(Q) your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father’s household to death.(R) Did you invite us here to steal our property?” 16Then Samson’s wife threw herself on him, sobbing, “You hate me! You don’t really love me.(S) You’ve given my people a riddle, but you haven’t told me the answer.”“I haven’t even explained it to my father or mother,” he replied, “so why should I explain it to you?” 17She cried the whole seven days(T) of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people. 18Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him,“What is sweeter than honey?What is stronger than a lion?”(U)Samson said to them,“If you had not plowed with my heifer,you would not have solved my riddle.” 19Then the Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him.(V) He went down to Ashkelon,(W) struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of everything and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger,(X) he returned to his father’s home. 20And Samson’s wife was given to one of his companions(Y) who had attended him at the feast.\nFootnotesJudges 14:15 Some Septuagint manuscripts and Syriac; Hebrew seventh\nCross referencesJudges 14:1 : S Jdg 13:24\nJudges 14:1 : S Ge 38:12\nJudges 14:2 : S Ge 21:21\nJudges 14:3 : S Ge 24:4\nJudges 14:3 : S Ge 34:14; S 1Sa 14:6\nJudges 14:3 : S Ex 34:16\nJudges 14:4 : S Dt 2:30\nJudges 14:4 : S Jos 11:20\nJudges 14:4 : Jdg 13:1; 15:11\nJudges 14:6 : S Jdg 3:10\nJudges 14:6 : 1Sa 17:35\nJudges 14:10 : S Ge 29:22\nJudges 14:12 : S Nu 12:8; Eze 17:2; 20:49; 24:3; Hos 12:10\nJudges 14:12 : Ge 29:27\nJudges 14:12 : S Ge 45:22; S 2Ki 5:5\nJudges 14:14 : ver 18\nJudges 14:15 : Jdg 16:5; Ecc 7:26\nJudges 14:15 : S Lev 20:14; Jdg 15:6\nJudges 14:16 : Jdg 16:15\nJudges 14:17 : Est 1:5\nJudges 14:18 : ver 14\nJudges 14:19 : S Jdg 3:10\nJudges 14:19 : S Jos 13:3\nJudges 14:19 : 1Sa 11:6\nJudges 14:20 : Jdg 15:2, 6; Jn 3:29\nNext\nJudges 13Judges 15Next\ndropdown\nBible Gateway RecommendsNIV, The Woman's Study Bible, Full-Color, Red Letter: Receiving God's Truth for Balance, Hope, and TransformationRetail: $49.99Our Price: $29.99Save: $20.00 (40%)Buy NowThe Jesus Bible Artist Edition, NIV, Comfort PrintRetail: $74.98Our Price: $44.99Save: $29.99 (40%)Buy NowNIV Study Bible, Fully Revised Edition, Large Print, Red Letter, Comfort PrintRetail: $79.98Our Price: $47.99Save: $31.99 (40%)Buy NowNIV, Cultural Backgrounds Study Bible, Red Letter Edition: Bringing to Life the Ancient World of ScriptureRetail: $59.99Our Price: $41.99Save: $18.00 (30%)Buy NowNIV, Radiant Virtues Bible: A Beautiful Word Collection, Red Letter Edition, Comfort Print: Explore the virtues of faith, hope, and loveRetail: $69.98Our Price: $48.99Save: $20.99 (30%)Buy NowNIV, Artisan Collection Bible, Gilded Edges, Red Letter Edition, Comfort PrintRetail: $59.99Our Price: $35.99Save: $24.00 (40%)Buy NowView more titles\nAbout\nAbout\nLearn About the Bible\nStatement of Faith\nMobile App\nStore\nBlog\nNewsroom\nSupport Us\nHelp\nFAQs\nTutorials\nUse Bible Gateway on Your Site\nAdvertise with us\nContact us\nPrivacy policy\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nSite: Terms of use\nWidget: Terms of use\nOur Network\nFaithGateway\nStudyGateway\nChurchSource\nHarperCollins Christian Publishing\nGrupo Nelson\nEditorial Vida\nThomas Nelson\nWestBow Press\nZondervan\nMasterLectures\nSocial\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPinterest\nTikTok\nTwitter\nYouTube\nPreferences\nVersión en español\nPreferences\nSign Up For Weekly Updates\nPreferences\nVersión en español\nPreferences"

And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. 4But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 5Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. 6And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 7And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 8And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. 9And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. 10So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 11And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 12And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments: 13But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. 14And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle. 15And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so? 16And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee? 17And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. 18And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 19And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. 20But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.\nNext\nJudges 13Judges 15Next\ndropdown\nKing James Version (KJV) Public Domain\nBible Gateway RecommendsKJV Holy Bible Large Print Center-Column Reference Bible, 53,000 Cross References, Red Letter, Comfort PrintRetail: $39.99Our Price: $20.00Save: $19.99 (50%)Buy NowKJV Study Bible, Large Print, Red Letter Edition: Second EditionRetail: $49.99Our Price: $34.99Save: $15.00 (30%)Buy NowKJV, The King James Study Bible, Red Letter, Full-Color Edition: KJV Holy BibleRetail: $59.99Our Price: $35.99Save: $24.00 (40%)Buy NowKJV, Sovereign Collection Bible, Personal Size, Red Letter Edition, Comfort Print: Holy Bible, King James VersionRetail: $39.99Our Price: $23.99Save: $16.00 (40%)Buy NowKJV, Word Study Bible, Red Letter Edition: 1,700 Key Words that Unlock the Meaning of the BibleRetail: $44.99Our Price: $26.99Save: $18.00 (40%)Buy NowKJV, Amplified, Parallel Bible, Large Print, Red Letter Edition: Two Bible Versions Together for Study and ComparisonRetail: $49.99Our Price: $29.99Save: $20.00 (40%)Buy NowView more titles\nAbout\nAbout\nLearn About the Bible\nStatement of Faith\nMobile App\nStore\nBlog\nNewsroom\nSupport Us\nHelp\nFAQs\nTutorials\nUse Bible Gateway on Your Site\nAdvertise with us\nContact us\nPrivacy policy\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\nSite: Terms of use\nWidget: Terms of use\nOur Network\nFaithGateway\nStudyGateway\nChurchSource\nHarperCollins Christian Publishing\nGrupo Nelson\nEditorial Vida\nThomas Nelson\nWestBow Press\nZondervan\nMasterLectures\nSocial\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPinterest\nTikTok\nTwitter\nYouTube\nPreferences\nVersión en español\nPreferences\nSign Up For Weekly Updates\nPreferences\nVersión en español\nPreferences"

Samson seeks a Philistine wife.\n1. (1-3) Samson demands a Philistine wife.\nNow Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. So he went up and told his father and mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore, get her for me as a wife.” Then his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your brethren, or among all my people, that you must go and get a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?” And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”\na. Saw a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: This seemed to be a case of “love at first sight” for Samson. He saw this woman and he instantly wanted to marry her.\ni. She pleases me well is literally, “she is right in my eyes.” What Samson really cared about was how things looked to himself, not how they looked to the LORD.\ni. Love at first sight is a powerful, but dangerous thing. It is entirely possible for us to fall in love with someone that we have no business falling in love with – which was exactly the case with Samson here. As well, love at first sight feels wonderful, but doesn’t last in its initial form forever. We can be attracted more to the feeling of love itself than the person we focus upon – whom we don’t really know at first sight.\nb. Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well”: In demanding a Philistine wife, Samson showed a sinful disregard for his parents and for God’s will (Deuteronomy 7:3-4). Bound by romantic feelings, there are many people who still demand from God a mate out of God’s will.\ni. “His parents attempted to dissuade him, but he allowed himself to be swept by his passion and determined to realize his own desires.” (Morgan)\nii. The command to the Israelis to not intermarry with the pagan nations around them applies to the Christian today in that a Christian must not marry someone who is not a Christian, joining themselves together with an unbeliever (2 Corinthians 6:14).\niii. It isn’t because those who are not Christians are not lovable – they are sometimes more lovable than believers. It is not because they aren’t good enough, or worthy of our love, or that they are somehow inherently incapable of being a good marriage partner. It is simply because to be a Christian means Jesus Christ is the most important thing in your life; and when a Christian and a non-Christian get together, you have two people who disagree on the most important things in life.\niv. By extension, a Christian should never date a non-Christian. Those who do run a serious risk of falling in love with someone they have no business falling in love with.\nv. Additionally, a Christian is advised to carefully discern the Christian commitment of the one they are interested in. There have been many pretended conversions, calculated to merely entice a Christian to marriage.\nvi. If someone goes against God’s plan and marries an unbeliever or if someone becomes a Christian before their spouse, there are specific commands applying to their situation. The Apostle Paul clearly wrote that this one must do all that is possible to stay in the marriage, and be the best spouse they can be (1 Corinthians 7:10-16).\nvii. God did use Samson mightily; but God used Samson despite his sin, not because of it. It is fair to suppose that God may have used Samson in a far greater way if he made himself a clean vessel according to the principle of 2 Timothy 2:20-21.\n2. (4) God’s will behind the scenes of Samson’s desire to marry a Philistine woman.\nBut his father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD; that He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines. For at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.\na. His father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD: As the rest of the chapter shows, some good ultimately came out of this ungodly marriage. Many Philistines were killed, and they were kept off balance in their attempts to dominate the Israelites.\ni. However, none of that justified Samson’s actions. Though God can make even the evil of man to serve His purposes, it never justifies the evil that man does.\nb. He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines: In accomplishing this purpose, God did not make a reluctant Samson pursue the Philistine woman for marriage. God allowed Samson to do what he wanted to do, though the act itself was sinful. God allowed it for reasons in both Samson’s life and for reasons on a larger scale.\ni. Someone today might justify their desire to marry a non-Christian because they trust some good will come out of it – such as their non-Christian partner eventually coming to Jesus. Things may work out that way, but even though God used Samson’s marriage to a Philistine woman, it all came at a great personal cost to Samson.\nii. No matter how much good God can bring out of even the bad things we do, He can always bring far more good out of our obedience – and we ourselves experience much less pain.\n3. (5-9) Samson slays a lion and eats some wild honey.\nSo Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Now to his surprise, a young lion came roaring against him. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. Then he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. After some time, when he returned to get her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion. And behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the carcass of the lion. He took some of it in his hands and went along, eating. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they also ate. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion.\na. He came to the vineyards of Timnah: Samson was dedicated to God with a lifelong vow of a Nazirite (Judges 13:4-5). Nazirites were to have nothing to do with grape products in any form (Numbers 6:3-4). Samson was dangerously close to significant compromise.\nb. He tore the lion apart as one would have torn apart a young goat: Though Samson flirted with compromise – both with his impending marriage and the vineyards of Timnah – he still had miraculous strength because the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him.\ni. “If that roaring lion, that goes about continually seeking whom he may devour, find us alone among the vineyards of the Philistines, where is our hope? Not in our heels, he is swifter than we: not in our weapons, we are naturally unarmed: not in our hands, which are weak and languishing; but in the Spirit of God, by whom we can do all things. If God fight in us, who call resist us? There is a stronger lion in us than that against us.” (Spurgeon)\nii. The Holy Spirit of God wants to come upon us and give us power but power for something far more important than ripping apart lions. The Holy Spirit comes upon us for the empowering to live for God as we should and for the power to tell others about Jesus effectively.\nc. She pleased Samson well: This does not mean that she was a good woman for Samson to be attracted to or to marry. It is possible to fall in love with someone who is actually very wrong for us. This is why Proverbs 4:23 says: Keep (literally, guard or protect) your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life. If we don’t guard our hearts, we can end up in trouble.\ni. If we find that we are already in love with a wrong person, the only thing to do is to give them up, because it is right before God. Jesus told us that following Him would require that we give up the things we love most (Mark 10:29-30).\nd. He took some of it in his hands and went along: When Samson gathered honey from the dead carcass of a lion, he expressly violated his Nazirite vow, which stipulated that a Nazirite should never touch a dead body or carcass (Numbers 6:6-7).\ni. Significantly, Samson did this after he was remarkably filled with the Holy Spirit. This shows that an outpouring of the Holy Spirit does not automatically make a person godlier. An outpouring of the Holy Spirit gives one the resources to be godlier, but it doesn’t “do it to” them. A person can be wonderfully gifted by the Holy Spirit and yet very spiritually immature.\ne. He did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcass of the lion: Samson did not tell his parents where he got the honey because he knew it was a compromise of his Nazirite vow.\ni. Samson had consecration (at least the appearance of it) without communion. This was only good for the sake of image. The empty nature of his consecration would eventually be evident.\nii. In the killing of the lion and the sharing of the honey, Spurgeon saw a spiritual picture of the work of Jesus Christ for us: “And what a type we have here of our Divine Lord and Master. Jesus, the conqueror of death and hell. He has destroyed the lion that roared upon us and upon him…I see our triumphant Lord laden with sweetness, holding it forth to all his brethren, and inviting them to share in his joy.” (Spurgeon)\niii. In the same way, Samson shared the sweetness of his victory over the lion with others. Spurgeon pointed out that this is, by analogy, a pattern for the way we should share the gospel.\n·Samson brought the honey first to those nearest to him.\n·Samson brought the honey in his hands, in the simply way available to him.\n·Samson actually gave them some of the honey to taste.\n·Samson brought the honey modestly, not boasting about killing the lion.\nB. The feast and the riddle.\n1. (10-11) Samson hosts a “bachelor party” for Philistine friends.\nSo his father went down to the woman. And Samson gave a feast there, for young men used to do so. And it happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.\na. Samson gave a feast there: Literally, this was a drinking feast. If Samson didn’t break his Nazirite vow by partaking in the wine, he certainly put himself in a situation where it would be easy to do so.\nb. They brought thirty companions to be with him: It was not – and is not – difficult to get many people to be part of a drinking feast.\n2. (12-14) Samson poses a riddle concerning the lion and the honey.\nThen Samson said to them, “Let me pose a riddle to you. If you can correctly solve and explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. But if you cannot explain it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.” And they said to him, “Pose your riddle, that we may hear it.” So he said to them:\n“Out of the eater came something to eat,\nAnd out of the strong came something sweet.”\nNow for three days they could not explain the riddle.\na. Changes of clothing: This literally describes a fine suit of clothes one would wear to an important occasion; therefore 30 fine suits were wagered. Like most betting, this “friendly wager” would turn into something not quite so friendly.\nb. Out of the eater came something to eat: This was a clever riddle, and Samson showed that even if he was weak morally he was not weak intellectually.\n3. (15-18) Samson’s Philistine wife extracts the answer to the riddle from Samson and tells it to the Philistines.\nBut it came to pass on the seventh day that they said to Samson’s wife, “Entice your husband, that he may explain the riddle to us, or else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us in order to take what is ours? Is that not so?” Then Samson’s wife wept on him, and said, “You only hate me! You do not love me! You have posed a riddle to the sons of my people, but you have not explained it to me.” And he said to her, “Look, I have not explained it to my father or my mother; so should I explain it to you?” Now she had wept on him the seven days while their feast lasted. And it happened on the seventh day that he told her, because she pressed him so much. Then she explained the riddle to the sons of her people. So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down:\n“What is sweeter than honey?\nAnd what is stronger than a lion?”\nAnd he said to them:\n“If you had not plowed with my heifer,\nYou would not have solved my riddle!”\na. Then Samson’s wife wept on him, and said, “You only hate me! You do not love me”: Samson’s Philistine wife knew how to manipulate the situation and how to make herself a burden to her husband until she got what she wanted from him.\ni. Some wives will make themselves a burden to their husbands until they get what they want. This tactic is used because it often works in the short term; but it can poison the relationship and ends up costing more than it gains.\nb. He told her, because she pressed him so much: A woman easily manipulated the world’s strongest man. This weakness of Samson will later be the cause of his downfall.\ni. The willingness of Samson’s Philistine wife to side with her people against Samson shows a fundamental weakness in their marriage. She did not fulfill the idea essential to marriage of leaving one’s father and mother to be joined in a one flesh relationship to their spouse (Genesis 2:24; Matthew 19:5). Yet this also shows why it was wrong for Samson to marry a Philistine. We cannot expect someone who does not love the God of Israel to build a marriage on God’s principles.\nii. However, we see that the reason Samson’s wife cooperated against her husband was also somewhat complicated. She acted out of fear because of their threat (else we will burn you and your father’s house with fire). If she told Samson about the threats, he could have more than handled the situation. She apparently did not feel safe with Samson, but he was her best safety.\nc. If you had not plowed with my heifer, You would not have solved my riddle: Samson’s use of this proverb showed the anger and bitterness he felt at being manipulated. Samson’s wife “won” what she wanted through manipulation, but she lost her husband’s heart.\ni. When a man gives in to his wife’s manipulations so as to keep peace, it almost always builds anger and resentment in the man – and guilt in the woman for what she did. The way of manipulation is tempting (because it works), but always brings real destruction.\n4. (19-20) Samson’s anger and revenge.\nThen the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle. So his anger was aroused, and he went back up to his father’s house. And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man.\na. Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily: The Spirit of the LORD did not come upon Samson to avenge the hurt feelings of a husband. God’s strategy was larger: He was seeking an occasion to move against the Philistines (Judges 14:4). Therefore, He used this occasion to pour out His Spirit on Samson to fight against the Philistines.\nb. Killed thirty of their men, took their apparel, and gave the changes of clothing to those who had explained the riddle: Samson paid off the bet, but he did it at the expense of the Philistines. He killed thirty of these enemies of Israel and gave their garments to satisfy the debt.\nc. Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man: Samson won the battle but lost the war. His wife left him and went to his best man. It is interesting to think what Samson and his wife might say if they went in for marriage counseling.\ni. What Samson might say to a marriage counselor: I love my wife, but it seems that we are not moving in the same direction. All I hear is nag, nag, nag; I finally do what she nags me to do, but by then I’m angry and the situation is worse than ever. I need to feel that she supports me, and that she’s on my side. I think she wants to give up on the marriage if she hasn’t already.\nii. What Samson’s wife might say to a marriage counselor: My husband is a good guy, but he does not meet my needs. It was love at first sight for us, but now things have gone downhill. There are things I need him to do and to be that he just can’t or won’t. He doesn’t respond to my needs and then we just get into a big fight, and no one is happy. I wonder if he loves me anymore.\niii. Samson was at fault for not guarding his heart against falling in love with a woman he had no business falling in love with. He was at fault for not founding the marriage on God’s principles. He was also at fault for not responding to his wife’s manipulations with love, free from anger.\niv. At the same time, Samson’s wife was at fault for siding with others against her husband. She was at fault for not telling her husband what the real problem was. And she was at fault for manipulating her husband by being such a bother until she got her way. Most of all, she was at fault for giving up on the marriage. Samson didn’t leave her; she left him. No matter what the problems in a relationship, what God commands us most of all is to not give up on the marriage.\nv. We might rightly say with Charles Spurgeon: “Samson himself is a riddle. He was not only a riddle-maker; but he was himself an enigma very difficult to explain.” (Spurgeon)\n©2018 David Guzik – No distribution beyond personal use without permission\nTweetPin2Share2527

In quel tempo, i Filistei dominavano Israele.\n5Poi Sansone scese con suo padre e con sua madre a Timnah; e come furon giunti alle vigne di Timnah, ecco un leoncello farglisi incontro, ruggendo.\n6Lo spirito dellâEterno investÃ¬ Sansone, che, senzâaver niente in mano, squarciÃ² il leone, come uno squarcerebbe un capretto; ma non disse nulla a suo padre nÃ© a sua madre di ciÃ² che avea fatto.\n7E scese, parlÃ² alla donna, e questa gli piacque.\n8Di lÃ¬ a qualche tempo, tornÃ² per prenderla, e uscÃ¬ di strada per vedere il carcame del leone; ed ecco, nel corpo del leone câera uno sciame dâapi e del miele.\n9Egli prese in mano di quel miele, e si mise a mangiarlo per istrada; e quando ebbe raggiunto suo padre e sua madre, ne diede loro, ed essi ne mangiarono; ma non disse loro che avea preso il miele dal corpo del leone.\n10Suo padre scese a trovar quella donna, e Sansone fece quivi un convito; perchÃ© tale era il costume dei giovani.\n11Non appena i parenti della sposa videro Sansone, invitarono trenta compagni perchÃ© stessero con lui.\n12Sansone disse loro: \"Io vi proporrÃ² un enimma; e se voi me lo spiegate entro i sette giorni del convito, e se lâindovinate, vi darÃ² trenta tuniche e trenta mute di vesti;\n13ma, se non me lo potete spiegare, darete trenta tuniche e trenta mute di vesti a me\".\n14E quelli gli risposero: \"Proponi il tuo enimma, e noi lâudremo\". Ed egli disse loro: \"Dal mangiatore Ã¨ uscito del cibo, e dal forte e uscito del dolce\". Per tre giorni quelli non poterono spiegar lâenimma.\n15E il settimo giorno dissero alla moglie di Sansone: \"Induci il tuo marito a spiegarci lâenimma; se no, darem fuoco a te e alla casa di tuo padre. E che? ci avete invitati qui per spogliarci?\"\n16La moglie di Sansone si mise a piangere presso di lui, e a dirgli: \"Tu non hai per me che dellâodio, e non mi vuoi bene; hai proposto un enimma a figliuoli del mio popolo e non me lâhai spiegato!\" Ed egli a lei: \"Ecco, non lâho spiegato a mio padre nÃ© a mia madre, e lo spiegherei a te?\"\n17Ed ella pianse presso di lui, durante i sette giorni che durava il convito; e il settimo giorno Sansone glielo spiegÃ², perchÃ© lo tormentava; ed essa spiegÃ² lâenimma ai figliuoli del suo popolo.\n18E gli uomini della cittÃ, il settimo giorno, prima che tramontasse il sole, dissero a Sansone: \"Che vâÃ¨ di piÃ¹ dolce del miele? e che vâÃ¨ di piÃ¹ forte del leone?\" Ed egli rispose loro: \"Se non aveste arato con la mia giovenca, non avreste indovinato il mio enimma\".\n19E lo spirito dellâEterno lo investÃ¬, ed egli scese ad Askalon, vi uccise trenta uomini dei loro, prese le loro spoglie, e dette le mute di vesti a quelli che aveano spiegato lâenimma. E, acceso dâira, risalÃ¬ a casa di suo padre.\n20Ma la moglie di Sansone fu data al compagno di lui, châei sâera scelto per amico.Italian: Riveduta Bible (1927)Bible Hub"

And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring. 6yThen the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. 7Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson’s eyes. 8After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. 9He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion. 10His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do. 11As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. 12And Samson said to them, z“Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within athe seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty bchanges of clothes, 13but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.” And they said to him, “Put your riddle, that we may hear it.” 14And he said to them, “Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet.” And in three days they could not solve the riddle. 15On the fourth1 day they said to Samson’s wife, c“Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, dlest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us?” 16And Samson’s wife wept over him and said, e“You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is.” And he said to her, “Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?” 17She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because fshe pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people. 18And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?” And he said to them, “If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle.” 19gAnd the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to hAshkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house. 20And Samson’s wife was given to ihis companion, jwho had been his best man.\nRead more\nExplain verse\nShare\nCopy\nShow footnotes\nHide footnotes\nCreate account\nCreate account\nCreate a free account\nAlready have an account?\nSign in"

Get her for me as a wife.”\n3a His father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among your kinsfolk or among all your people, that you must go and take a woman from the uncircumcised Philistines?” But Samson answered his father, “Get her for me, for she is the one I want.”\n4b Now his father and mother did not know that this had been brought about by the LORD, who was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines;* for at that time they ruled over Israel.c\nFor three days they were unable to answer the riddle,\n15and on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife,f “Trick your husband into solving the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your family.g Did you invite us here to reduce us to poverty?”\n16* h So Samson’s wife wept at his side and said, “You just hate me! You do not love me! You proposed a riddle to my people, but did not tell me the answer.” He said to her, “If I did not tell even my father or my mother, must I tell you?”\n17But she wept beside him during the seven days the feast lasted, and on the seventh day, he told her the answer, because she pressed him, and she explained the riddle to her people.i\n19j The spirit of the LORD rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty of their men and stripped them; he gave their garments to those who had answered the riddle. Then he went off to his own family in anger,\n20and Samson’s wife was married to the companion who had been his best man.k\nCopyright 2019-2024 USCCB, please review our Privacy Policy\nPagination\nPrevious chapter\nPrevious chapter\nChapter 14\nNext chapter\nNext chapter\nDive into God's Word\nDaily Readings\nListen to Podcasts\nWatch our Videos\nLearn More\nTopics\nAbortion\nAfrica\nAfrican American\nAsia\nAsian/Pacific Islander\nAssisted Suicide\nBible\nBioethics\nCatechesis\nCatechetical Sunday\nCatholic Safeguards\nCatholic Social Teaching\nChild and Youth Protection\nEXPAND ALL TOPICS\nPrayer & Worship\nDaily Readings Calendar\nBooks of the BIble\nSearch Mass Times\nPrayer\nLiturgical Year & Calendar\nSacraments\nLiturgy of the Hours\nThe Mass\nGet Involved to Act Now\nTake Action\nHelp Now\nMeetings & Events\nPray\nQuick Links\nParish/Mass Finder\nResources\nCalendars\nNewsletter Signup\nSocial Media\n©2023 United States Conference of Catholic Bishops\nTwitter\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedin\nInstagram\nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization\nPrivacy Policy\nMade possible by funding from"
