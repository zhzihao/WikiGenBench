Unfortunately, while I'd like to say that the originality alone does for a great watch, but the truth is that the movie fails to create an emotional connection and is at times unable to maintain the tone through their disjointed ideas, in short, it fails at the execution of the story a little.\nThestoryis about learning to appreciate the people who love us and let go of our stereotypes & prejudices to understand and accept our feelings. Even though therearelots of symbolism in the story, nothing is really deep or complicated, it's a kid's story after all, so it's done in simple terms.\nThecharactersand their wacky quirks are probably some of the best parts of the show, where the creativity really shows. There is a mix of mythologies from Merlin, The Witch of the North,Terminator, I mean Incinerator to aMazingerGirl, Toilet Paper & Milk Cow; crazy, I know, but somehow they blend together in the story.\nTheanimationis both good and bad, on one side is a nice departure from the traditional Japanese style, including all of their cliches in both characters and interactions. It has a colorful palette and original character designs. On the other side, the foreground characters seem like it was cut and paste into the backgrounds, creating almost 2 different qualities for the animation.\nMusic plays a big role throughout the movie and both Korean & English songs are good, likable, soft, pop songs. I prefer the dub, but that is my opinion.\nThedubis great. The voice actors do a good job both for the voices of the characters and singing the songs in the dub.\nOverall, this is a good watch if you value originalityandcreativity over a cohesive story and emotional connection to what's happening to the characters. It is at the very least an interesting watch to see what else is out there besides Japanese animation and shows a future of open possibilities for the Korean animation industry.\n'Korea's animation industry is largely unremarkable, which is really a shame because the country has shown through its live-action productions that it is certainly not lacking in artistic talent.Satellite Girl and Milk Cow, however, shows promise for the future of the industry. Its charm and earnestness are reminiscent of similar Japanese animations, while still maintaining its originality. Although it may be rough around the edges, and you can't expect much in terms of animation, it's still enjoyable and is hopefully a sign of more good things to come.'-JRossi\n8\n9\nComments\n1 comments\nLeave a comment\nYou must be logged in to leave comments.

Which of these films are the best Korean aeni that deserve your time and attention? That depends on what you're looking for.\nLeafie,A Hen Into The Wildis a kid-friendly film that follows a hen who escapes the farm where she's being held so that she can realize her dream of being a mother. Whether you're a parent looking for a new movie for your children or just appreciate a more light-hearted touch, this movie is a great option. Meanwhile,The Faketells the decidedly adult story of a town taken in by a con artist cult leader, and the town drunk who tries to stop him.\nAll of these animated Korean movies have something to offer. Vote up the ones you already know you love or the ones that you're putting on your to-watch list.1852 VOTESYobi, The Five Tailed FoxPhoto: user uploaded imageThe nine-tailed fox is a common figure in East Asian mythology, and the Korean version is called the kumiho. The legend of the kumiho loosely informs the story ofYobi, The Five Tailed Fox.Yobi is a mythical fox who transforms into a human when she decides to protect an alien who is stranded on earth and rejected by its fellow aliens. She winds up in a school for misfit children and ends up falling in love with the world of humans - and growing attached to her new human friend,Geum-ee. She tries to live an idyllic life in the world of humans, but this is easier said than done. Eventually, she needs a human soul - and she also has to protectGeum-ee from the Shadow Man's nefarious plot.\n852 votes2798 VOTESSeoul StationPhoto: Next Entertainment WorldHye-sun is trying to escape life in a brothel. Meanwhile, her father Suk-gyu is trying to get in touch with his estranged daughter. Before either of them can achieve their goals, they're interrupted by a zombie outbreak, which takes everything they have to survive.\nSeoul Station is actually an animated prequel to another film by the same director,a live-action moviecalledTrain to Busan.\n798 votes3409 VOTESOseamPhoto: Sinabro EntertainmentThough well-regarded in both Korea and France,Oseamis virtually unknown in the USA. It follows two orphans, Gami and Gilson, who find a new home at aMahayanaBuddhist temple. To earn their keep, the two help out around the temple. As they settle into their lives there, they try to come to terms with losing their parents, home, and Gami's eyesight to a fire.

She's almost completely given up on her dreams of being an athlete when she meetsCheol-soo and Soo-min, two classmates with dreams and problems of their own. The relationships between the three teens spark growth and change for all three of them.\nThis completely hand-drawn film was well-received by critics, but fared poorly in its international release, making it an underrated gem of Korean cinema.\n271 votes5225 VOTESLeafie, A Hen Into The WildPhoto: Myung FilmsLeafie, A Hen Into The Wild,follows an ambitious chicken who is dissatisfied with life laying eggs on a chicken farm.

Her dream comes true when she escapes the farm and ends up caring for a duckling, who she names Greenie. Though she encounters seemingly insurmountable obstacles, she overcomes them all to be a good mother to her adopted child.\nThis movie holds the distinction of being the first Korean animated film to play in Chinese movie theaters.

To counter this, a city called Ecoban is built to run on the DELOS system, a powerful means of transforming pollution into energy. All of this comes at a cost - an underclass that must work outside of the city to collect carbonite to run the system. One of these workers isShua, a young man who finds himself forced to choose between two lovers - his childhood friend Jay, and a high-ranking security officer from Ecoban, Cade.\nThis film uses an interesting animation strategy - the background is done almost entirely in CGI, but the characters are drawn on cels.\n359 votesload more"
