So something got lost in translation ... this is the Royal Court!A place loaded with history and housing 2 landmarks of the city - the Sunset Tower (Chindiei tower - most likely the building started in the times of Vlad \"The Impaler\" Tepes) and the Princely Church - that actually was the church of the kings , attached to the Royal Palace - that was build in the era of Petru Cercel - towards the mid/end of the 1500's. Entrance fee is 12 Ron for adults - so almost for free .. what I was missing is the lack of guides, however there are plenty of panels describing what you can see there. The ruined palace of King Pretu Cercel would deserve a rebuild from my perspective , still the ruined palace has a certain charm to it. Another highlight is the National Old Romanian Books museum ... it is a very interesting place to visit and there is no surcharge, you will enter with the same ticket as to whole complex. Also there is a plaque at the entrance - behind the gate - with the line of Wallachia kings listed ... a very nice walk through the ages. Overall a great lesson in history for those who are interested ... and definitely appealing for kids. When you are in Targoviste it is a definite must visit and a great experience, I recommend you visit this place ...Read moreWritten November 7, 2022This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

It's inexpensive to get into the park and you get to see the church, the ruins, the library and all the grounds. The court was cool and eerie, with remnants of history sprinkled everywhere, including a few torture devices. Recently there have been some upgrades that include an historical look at how the damage was sustained, heads of state who visited, unearthing news parts and it was all educational and exciting.Took so many photos and learned a lot.

I really don't understand why this site has so many good reviews...I guess that people never saw another hostorical site...Read moreWritten June 10, 2018This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

You can find Diana on LinkedIn Tweet Targoviste Fortress is one of the most important medieval monuments in Romania. With a history that goes back to the 15th century, this fortress was the residence of some of the most famous princes of Southern Romania, including Constantin Brancoveanu and the legendary Vlad the Impaler. Read alsoSouthern Romania: An Underrated Travel Destination Chindia Tower Targoviste was a medieval capital Targoviste was the capital of Southern Romaniain the medieval centuries before Bucharest achieved this status. The princely court was mentioned starting with 1417-1418 in a document of Michael the 1st. During this initial stage, the fortress was rather small, surrounded by a wooden defensive wall. It’s Vlad Dracul who extended and modernized the court to the standards of a princely residence, fortified against enemy attacks. His son, the famous Vlad the Impaler built around 1460 the Tower of Chindia, later heightened to 27 meters, with three floors connected by a winding staircase, plus an open terrace on the last level. The tower hosts today an exhibition focused on the life and reign of Vlad the Impaler. View from the Great Church By the end of the 16th century, Prince Petru Cercel built the Great Church, a new palace, and fortified the court with an overall surface of 29,000 square meters. The last major restoration and period of glory took place during the reign of Constantin Brancoveanu (1688-1714) who connected the two existing palaces and repainted the Great Church. After his tragic death, the princely court from Targoviste was permanently abandoned in favor of the Old Court from Bucharest. Don’t miss Chindia Tower Start with a walk up to Chindia Tower, the symbol of the princely court of Targoviste. A view from the tower’s balcony will give you a panoramic perspective over the entire court. From the balcony, you can also observe the contour of a church dating back to 1415. The ruins of the old palace After walking around what remains of the palace, visit the two churches that still survive centuries after they were built. The small Holly Friday Church is located close to Asylum built by Lady Balasa. Not as impressive as the Great Princely Church, this is, however, the only monument built in the 15th century in Southern Romania still conserved in its original form. Close to the princely palace, once connected by a direct corridor, stands the remarkable Great Princely Church. Built by Petru Cercel between 1583 and 1585, the church has a Greek cross plan and impressive dimensions for that time. Completely repainted by Constantinos at the end of the 17th century, the church still preserves these frescoes, including the greatest gallery of Wallachian princes on the narthex walls. Paintings of the Great Church Once a prosperous and important princely court, the Targoviste Fortress is one of the few medieval monuments that still exists in Southern Romania. Less than two hours away from Bucharest, this landmark is more than worth a day trip from the capital. Travel tips Check the visiting schedule on www.muzee-dambovitene.ro A few meters from the Holly Friday Church, you can visit the Museum of the Printing Press and Old Books. The collections include an 18th-century printing press as well as numerous old manuscripts. Visit also Poenari Fortress, Curtea de Arges Monastery, and Potlogi Palace to discover more landmarks from the region.
