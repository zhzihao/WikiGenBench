In this article Gjessing focused on the chronology of the Bronze Age horizon(s), that is, the carvings belonging to the South Scandinavian genre or tradition. However, also carvings belonging to the Stone Age or Arctic tradition are found at this site; these were presented in a later monograph . Bardal holds a unique position within Scandinavian rock-art because both traditions are represented with a substantial number of images and because these images take part in numerous superimposition ( ).See Full PDFDownload PDFSee Full PDFDownload PDFRelated PapersActa ArchaeologicaSTABILITY & CHANGE IN SCANDINAVIAN ROCK-ART2008 • Kalle SognnesDownload Free PDFView PDFSwedish Rock Art Series: Volume 6, North Meets South Theoretical Aspects on the Northern and Southern Rock Art Traditions in ScandinaviaWhere Styles Meet - What Does it Mean?2017 • Heidrun Marie Voldheim StebergløkkenThis chapter focuses on the concept of style in rock art. As in other parts of the world, style has primarily been used as a dating method in Norwegian rock art research. In combination with shoreline dating researchers developed a stylistic sequence of the rock art belonging to the Northern Tradition, which has been used to a greater or lesser extent for almost a century. An interesting characteristic of central Norway is the meeting between the Northern and the Southern Traditions. In this region, the different traditions coexist not just in this macro-perspective, but also side by side at the same sites – occasionally even at the same panels. The region is a perfect place to study the interaction between the two traditions. The rock art also shows enormous variation in style and drawing methods. What can this encounter tell us? And why does this area show such stylistic variation?Download Free PDFView PDFGutorm Gjessing and Norwegian rock-artKalle SognnesDownload Free PDFView PDFThe case of the lone reindeer: The Bøla rock art site in Trøndelag, NorwayKalle SognnesDownload Free PDFView PDFSapwell, M. & Janik, L. 2015. Making Community: Rock art and the creative acts of accumulation (H. Stebergløkken, R. Berge, E. Lindgaard and H. V. Stuedal (Eds.) Ritual Landscapes and Borders within Rock Art Research. Archaeopress. pp.47-58)Mark SapwellThis paper explores how the long-term addition of images to one place enables the development and exchange of knowledge in prehistoric northernmost Europe. In particular we focus on how rock art realises different senses of community in Sweden (Laxön, Nämforsen) and Russia (Zalavruga). We argue that for both rock art landscapes there exists consistent patterns in how motifs are placed in relation to each other, and most importantly demonstrates selective acts of accumulation where art was used in the act of including and excluding ideas by the community. Both Laxön and Zalavruga served as places where the collective relevance of ideas were evaluated and expressed through selective accumulation. While both palimpsests shared similar techniques of selective accumulation and repeating motifs, their effects in building community and a sense of the world are very different, and in some cases almost opposing. We hope that the approach presented in this paper can be applied to other parts of Northern Europe and beyond to explore the role of rock art in the exchange of ideas and the building of identities.Download Free PDFView PDFRock Art and the Rock Surface: Neolithic Rock Art Traditions of Britain, Ireland, and Northernmost EuropeAndrew Jones, Kalle Sognnes, Andrew CochraneDownload Free PDFView PDFNorth Meets SouthThe Meaning and Use(-fulness) of Traditions in Scandinavian Rock Art Research2017 • Trond LødøenThe paper questions the still predominant tendency to categorize Scandinavian prehistoric rock art into just two traditions, associated with hunting societies on the one hand and farming societies on the other. More than a century ago, the iconography from this part of Europe was separated into ‘South Scandinavian’ and ‘North Scandinavian’ rock art. Later on, the terms hunters’ and agrarian rock art came into use, together with other variants, before these were reconceptualised into the ‘Northern and Southern Traditions’ in the 1930s. Despite the fact that hundreds of sites have been rediscovered since the first categorization, we are still left with just two major groups of rock art in Scandinavia. Researchers have also argued in favor of merging the two traditions and even of interaction between them, but this has often been challenged by the widely-separated dating of the supposed traditions. This paper, which takes its point of departure in the Norwegian material, discusses a number of aspects associated with this categorization, questions both the background for the separation exclusively into these two traditions as well as the possible interaction between them, and argues in favor of a much more developed and nuanced classification of the still expanding bulk of rock art. This will be thoroughly problematized, as it will be argued that some of the sites normally labelled within the Northern Tradition, at least in Western Norway, share a number of features and elements with rock art of the Atlantic tradition of Central and southern Europe, thus indicating a potential interaction between Scandinavia and southern Europe at the end of the Late Mesolithic. This adds to other supposed influences from north-eastern and eastern Europe, thereby challenging the background for both the Southern and the Northern Traditions as clearly defined and consistent traditions.

Contributions that approach rock art with engendered perspectives are described, along with an appraisal of the present state of gendered rock art research. We regard rock art as part of the prevailing cosmologies of Stone and Bronze Age societies in northern Europe, and investigate how sex and gender are significant components of these. \"The great advantage of gender as an analytical tool is that it operates at all levels in society, from the structuring of daily life to cosmologies\".
