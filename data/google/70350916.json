The Qutbuddin sisters are studious, thanks to their strict father Qutbuddin. Ulfat, Qutbuddin's wife is often irritated over one thing or the other. And the patriarch of the family, dada ji is a lovely old man who is on tik-tok. Adam and Sarmad live with their good-for-nothing father, sweet mother, a younger sister and their grandmother who has online matchmaking business. We learn that the Sultan family is near-perfection when it comes to cooking and cleaning etc. Sarmad, the older brother runs an eatery 'Sarmad Ke Chatkhare'. Adam occasionally helps his older brother while Sultan does nothing except betting with people on cricket matches. He's apparently qualified and educated, but what's the use if that education isn't put to use?9.9/10(34)RateTop-ratedS1.E2 ∙ Episode #1.2Mon, Apr 4, 2022Dada's birthday party at Sarmad Ke Chatkhare is over when Qutbuddin calls Adam for his car.
