Activities included sewing classes, debate clubs, singing and storytelling for younger children.” - University of Louisville Archives\n\"One of the most exciting (and challenging) aspects of this project is that we were working with an organization that has been around for over 100 years. So while they were ready to completely update their look and feel, we simultaneously needed to honor the essence and work of the brand as it's existed for more than a century. This created a strategic balancing act between fine-tuning what they've been, and leveling that with how they will be seen going forward.\" - Ben Kemble, Associate Creative Director\nThe Approach\nNeighborhood House logo progression, 1900’s, 1970’s, 2000’s, 2010’s\nResults\n“My driving factor was thinking about how this rebrand could help uplift a really great organization in the community and ensure they stood out from the rest. That led us to create a unique mark that represented variety, diversity, consistency, friendliness, and depth. I thoroughly enjoyed working with my team at KERTIS to find the best approach for this project and working with the people at Neighborhood House who invited us to learn from them and offered us great constructive feedback” - Carolina Caicedo, Graphic Designer\nCareers 810 E Broadway, Louisville, KY 40204 sayhello@kertiscreative.com502.550.1549"
