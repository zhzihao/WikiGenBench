This citizen-led amendment will do just that: through our deep community partnerships and long history of protecting reproductive freedom and providing access to healthcare, this campaign puts the power back in the hands of the people of Ohio, so everyone has the freedom to prevent, continue, or end a pregnancy should they decide.\"\nDr. Lauren Beene, executive director of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights: \"Our common sense amendment will restore the rights and protections that were destroyed when Roe was overturned. It will preserve the doctor-patient relationship and empower all people to make their own reproductive health care decisions without interference from the government, lobbyists and politicians.\"\nJonathan Entin, professor emeritus of law and adjunct professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University: \"The claim that this is some kind of mechanism for sneaking transgender rights into the Ohio Constitution is just wrong. It's dishonest ... If you drink too much alcohol, if you ingest certain drugs, if you drive too fast — all of those things could have shorter or longer term implications for your ability to reproduce. That doesn't mean that speed limits and drug laws and alcohol regulations are somehow going to be affected by this amendment if it's adopted.\"\nGabriel Mann, spokesperson for Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights: \"The stakes couldn’t be higher. Ohio has an extreme abortion ban on the books with no exception for rape and incest or even when a woman’s life is at risk. Issue 1 is Ohio voters’ opportunity to remove that extreme abortion ban. It’s just that simple.\"\nFuture Providers, medical students and health professionals open letter: \"Let us be clear: if an abortion ban goes into effect in Ohio, we may not be able to continue to practice in this state. Abortion bans endanger patients. Many of us have taken, or will take, the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm to our patients. The patient-provider relationship is sacred and built on trust. Should an abortion ban go into effect, we will be unable to live up to the very promise that is the basis for our work as health professionals.\"\nOfficial arguments\nOfficial Argument in Support: \"Vote YES to keep government out of our family’s personal decisions. Ohioans agree that abortion is a personal, private decision that should be up to women and their families, not the government.\nOhioans are Voting YES because:\n● YES ensures people can make the decisions that are best for them and their families when it comes to contraception and abortion.\n● YES protects patients and families from extreme abortion bans. If this amendment fails, abortion could be banned even in cases of rape, incest, or when a woman’s life is at risk.\n● People from across the state, including Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and more than 4,000 doctors, nurses, and faith leaders back this amendment. Ohioans know that no matter how you feel about abortion personally, government should not have the power to make these personal medical decisions for the people you love.\n● YES prevents government from jailing patients who seek abortion or miscarriage care, and doctors who provide that care.\nThis fall, vote YES to keep government out of our family’s personal decisions. Ohioans deserve the freedom to make personal, medical decisions about pregnancy and abortion free from government interference.

Schnurr\n-\nRoman Catholic Archbishop\nArguments\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America: \"The amendment mentions limits are permitted after 'viability' but conveniently leaves it to the abortionist to determine whether the child is viable. While the amendment says it allows a health exception for abortions after viability, it uses language that has been interpreted by the courts to include mental, financial, and social health—making it effectively impossible to enforce any protections for children before birth.\"\nProtect Women Ohio: \"Using the label 'reproductive freedom,' the abortion industry wants to bring taxpayer funded abortion at any time during pregnancy, including beyond the point at which an unborn baby can feel pain, to Ohio. Their proposal would outlaw protections for the most vulnerable and would eliminate basic health and safety regulations in place to protect women.\"\nCarrie Campbell Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, and Frank J. Scaturro, vice president of the Judicial Crisis Network: \"The proposed amendment would outlaw virtually any restrictions on abortion and all other procedures, including sex-change surgeries, that touch on reproduction, for both adults and minors. It would cancel out not only parental-consent laws but also mere parental notification for minors’ abortions or sex-change surgeries; strike down health protections for people of all ages who undergo these procedures, including requirements that a qualified physician perform them; and erase any meaningful limits on late-term abortions.\"\nOhio Black Faith and Community Leaders open letter: \"We can only hope the abortion industry will one day be held to account for its dark history and depraved legacy, but in the meantime, we cannot allow it to continue pushing an agenda driven by racism and greed. Unfortunately, Issue 1 does just that. It is more extreme than Roe v. Wade, and it will allow for painful, late-term abortions through all nine months of pregnancy – even after an unborn baby can feel pain. It will permit our children to undergo abortions without parents knowing. And it will continue to rob generations of Black women and men of the insurmountable joy of parenthood.\"\nRoman Catholic Archbishop Dennis M. Schnurr: \"We must reject this extraordinary and dangerous attempt to radically reshape Ohio through a constitutional amendment that does nothing to aid women or promote life. The amendment’s supporters will claim that its passage is necessary to preserve medical treatment for women who experience miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies. This is not true. No Ohio laws – or the laws of any U.S. state, for that matter – prevent such treatment. Hospitals, including Catholic hospitals, and physicians have always provided comprehensive miscarriage care, and will continue to do so regardless of the outcome of this vote. Some may insist that the Catholic Church should not be involved in politics. However, the defense of life and care for women compels our participation in this critical moral issue. As Catholics, we are morally obliged to uphold the dignity of life of all vulnerable humans – immigrants, the poor, preborn children. We cannot remain silent on a direct ballot question like the one in November. The Church must not remain on the sidelines when confronted with such a clear threat to human life and dignity and the primacy of the family.\"\nOfficial arguments\nSen. Kristina Roegner (R), Sen. Michele Reynolds (R), and Rep. Melanie Miller (R), Official Argument Against: \"Vote NO on Issue 1\nSave Life, Protect Women, Defend Parents’ Rights\nIssue 1 is a dangerous attack on the unborn, women, and parents. It’s an extreme attempt to create abortion-on demand and to eliminate reasonable health and safety standards for pregnant women. It ends parental notification and excludes parents from their child’s medical decisions.\nAt its core, Issue 1 allows for-profit abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, to self-regulate and perform abortions up to viability and beyond at the sole discretion of the abortionist.\nDon’t enshrine late-term abortion in Ohio’s Constitution. Don’t erase parental rights. Don’t subject women to dangerous, unregulated medical procedures. Vote NO.\nWhen casting your NO vote, remember that Issue 1:\nEstablishes abortion-on-demand through all nine months.\n• Removes even basic limits on abortion. It allows for-profit abortion providers to make the final call on procedures, standards, and timing.\n• Allows dismemberment abortions; painful, late-term abortions; and abortions after a child is born alive by overriding current laws.\n• Permits abortion because of the child’s sex, race, or disability.\nErases parental rights.\n• Ends parental notification and prevents parents from being involved in their child’s medical decisions, like an abortion or irreversible sex-change operation.\n• Cuts parents out of the most important decisions in their children’s lives, while allowing abortion promoters to pressure those children behind closed doors.\nEliminates basic health and safety protections for women.\n• Abolishes care and safety standards for treatment of pregnant women, like requiring that abortions must be performed in-person by a licensed doctor who can transfer a woman to a hospital if something goes wrong.\nA NO vote protects Ohio’s Constitution from a dangerous amendment that creates abortion-on-demand and eliminates parental rights. Issue 1 hurts women and removes parents from their children’s medical decisions.\nSave human life, protect women, and defend parental rights.\nVote NO on Issue 1.\"\nCash Contributions\nIn-Kind Contributions\nTotal Contributions\nCash Expenditures\nTotal Expenditures\nSupport\n$50,266,399.12\n$3,559,471.95\n$53,825,871.07\n$49,884,713.21\n$53,444,185.16\nOppose\n$35,299,327.06\n$786,997.73\n$36,086,324.79\n$35,688,576.54\n$36,475,574.27\nCommittees in support of Issue 1\nCommittee\nCash Contributions\nIn-Kind Contributions\nTotal Contributions\nCash Expenditures\nTotal Expenditures\nOhioans United for Reproductive Rights\n$39,786,653.74\n$2,759,929.88\n$42,546,583.62\n$39,665,552.98\n$42,425,482.86\nOhioans for Reproductive Freedom PAC\n$8,505,010.42\n$430,546.69\n$8,935,557.11\n$8,312,489.74\n$8,743,036.43\nOhio Physicians for Reproductive Rights PAC\n$1,974,734.96\n$368,995.38\n$2,343,730.34\n$1,906,670.49\n$2,275,665.87\nTotal\n$50,266,399.12\n$3,559,471.95\n$53,825,871.07\n$49,884,713.21\n$53,444,185.16\nDonor\nCash Contributions\nIn-Kind Contributions\nTotal Contributions\nSixteen Thirty Fund\n$6,967,600.00\n$0.00\n$6,967,600.00\nLynn Schusterman\n$4,000,000.00\n$0.00\n$4,000,000.00\nOpen Society Policy Center\n$4,000,000.00\n$0.00\n$4,000,000.00\nTides Foundation\n$3,685,000.00\n$0.00\n$3,685,000.00\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n$3,270,787.10\n$218,651.87\n$3,489,438.97\nThe Fairness Project\n$2,800,000.00\n$0.00\n$2,800,000.00\nCommittees in opposition to Issue 1\nCommittee\nCash Contributions\nIn-Kind Contributions\nTotal Contributions\nCash Expenditures\nTotal Expenditures\nProtect Women Ohio\n$29,990,868.20\n$381,611.45\n$30,372,479.65\n$30,385,380.18\n$30,766,991.63\nProtect Women Ohio Action\n$5,305,458.86\n$405,386.28\n$5,710,845.14\n$5,303,166.36\n$5,708,552.64\nProtect Women Ohio Fund\n$3,000.00\n$0.00\n$3,000.00\n$30.00\n$30.00\nTotal\n$35,299,327.06\n$786,997.73\n$36,086,324.79\n$35,688,576.54\n$36,475,574.27\nDonor\nCash Contributions\nIn-Kind Contributions\nTotal Contributions\nSusan B.

We encourage Ohio voters to cut through the scare tactics and make a decision that not only aligns with their beliefs but the facts.\"\nNational Review Editorial Board: \"The average Ohioan would get the wrong impression by reading the text of the ballot measure that the amendment would allow meaningful limits on late-term abortion. The text of the amendment explicitly states that 'abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability.' But — and these are two very big buts — it also says (1) that physicians may determine viability on a 'case-by-case basis,' and (2) that there is a right to abortion after viability until birth to protect 'health' that is not limited to physical health. When a baby is clearly viable, threats to a mother’s physical health can be treated in minutes or hours by delivering a live baby, while a late-term abortion procedure takes days. So that provision is surely designed to enshrine a right to abortion until birth to protect mental health.\"\nThe Toledo Blade Editorial Board: \"Ohio needs a reasonable abortion law that respects the life of a fetus that is viable, and is also reasonably respectful of the lives of fetuses that aren’t yet viable. It needs a law that the great majority of Ohioans, pro-life and pro-choice, can accept. That’s a judgment that should be made through the legislative process, not through the unsubtle and permanent impact of amending the state constitution. ... The Blade has always supported women’s right to an abortion. This amendment to the state constitution goes too far and should be defeated.\"\nPoll\nDates\nSample size\nMargin of error\nSupport\nOppose\nUndecided\nData for Progress\n10/31/23-11/2/23\n582 LV\n± 4%\n57%\n40%\n3%\nOhio Northern University\n10/16/23-10/19/23\n668 RV\n± 3.8%\n52%\n36%\n12%\nBaldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute\n10/9/23-10/11/23\n850 RV\n± 4.5%\n58.2%\n33.5%\n8.2%\nOhio Northern University\n7/17/2023-7/26/2023\n675 LV\n± 3.7%\n53.8%\n30%\n16.2%\nUSA Today/Suffolk University\n7/9/2023-7/12/2023\n500 LV\n± 4.4%\n58%\n32%\n10%\nBaldwin Wallace University Community Research Institute\n9/30/2022-10/3/2022\n856 RV\n± 1.23%\n59.1%\n26.7%\n14.2%\nScripps News/YouGov\n6/20/2023-6/22/2023\n500 LV\n± 5.95%\n58%\n23%\n20%\nState abortion restrictions based on stage of pregnancy\nState\nThreshold for restriction\nAlabama\nYes\nConception\nAlaska\nNo\nNone\nArizona\nYes\n15 weeks since last menstrual period\nArkansas\nYes\nConception\nCalifornia\nYes\nFetal viability\nColorado\nNo\nNone\nConnecticut\nYes\nFetal viability\nDelaware\nYes\nFetal viability\nFlorida\nYes\n15 weeks since last menstrual period\nGeorgia\nYes\nSix weeks post-fertilization\nHawaii\nYes\nFetal viability\nIdaho\nYes\nConception\nIllinois\nYes\nFetal viability\nIndiana\nYes\n22 weeks since last menstrual period\nIowa\nYes\n20 weeks post-fertilization\nKansas\nYes\n20 weeks since last menstrual period\nKentucky\nYes\nConception\nLouisiana\nYes\nConception\nMaine\nYes\nFetal viability\nMaryland\nYes\nFetal viability\nMassachusetts\nYes\n24 weeks post-fertilization\nMichigan\nYes\nFetal viability\nMinnesota\nNo\nNone\nMississippi\nYes\nConception\nMissouri\nYes\nConception\nMontana\nYes\nFetal viability\nNebraska\nYes\n12 weeks post-fertilization\nNevada\nYes\n24 weeks post-fertilization\nNew Hampshire\nYes\n24 weeks since last menstrual period\nNew Jersey\nNo\nNone\nNew Mexico\nNo\nNone\nNew York\nYes\nFetal viability\nNorth Carolina\nYes\n12 weeks post-fertilization\nNorth Dakota\nYes\nConception\nOhio\nYes\n20 weeks post-fertilization\nOklahoma\nYes\nConception\nOregon\nNo\nNone\nPennsylvania\nYes\n24 weeks since last menstrual period\nRhode Island\nYes\nFetal viability\nSouth Carolina\nYes\n20 weeks post-fertilization\nSouth Dakota\nYes\nConception\nTennessee\nYes\nConception\nTexas\nYes\nConception\nUtah\nYes\n18 weeks since last menstrual period\nVermont\nNo\nNone\nVirginia\nYes\nThird trimester since last menstrual period\nWashington\nYes\nFetal viability\nWashington, D.C.\nNo\nNone\nWest Virginia\nYes\nConception\nWisconsin\nYes\n20 weeks post-fertilization\nWyoming\nYes\nFetal viability\nSources:Guttmacher Institute, \"State Policies on Later Abortions,\" accessed November 25, 2022; CNA, \"TRACKER: Check the status of abortion trigger laws across the U.S.,\" accessed November 25, 2022; The Fuller Project, \"How major abortion laws compare, state by state,\" accessed November 25, 2022\nState\nYear\nMeasure\nYes\nNo\nOutcome\nMaryland\n2024\nRight to Reproductive Freedom Amendment\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nNew York\n2024\nEqual Protection of Law Amendment\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nOhio\n2023\nRight to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative\nN/A\nN/A\na\nCalifornia\n2022\nProposition 1: Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment\n66.88%\n33.12%\na\nMichigan\n2022\nProposal 3: Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative\n56.66%\n43.34%\na\nVermont\n2022\nProposal 5: Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment\n76.77%\n23.23%\na\nState\nYear\nMeasure\nYes\nNo\nOutcome\nKansas\n2022\nNo State Constitutional Right to Abortion and Legislative Power to Regulate Abortion Amendment\n41.03%\n58.97%\nd\nKentucky\n2022\nNo State Constitutional Right to Abortion Amendment\n47.65%\n52.35%\nd\nLouisiana\n2020\nAmendment 1: No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment\n62.06%\n37.94%\na\nAlabama\n2018\nAmendment 2: State Abortion Policy Amendment\n59.01%\n40.99%\na\nWest Virginia\n2018\nAmendment 1: No Right to Abortion in Constitution Measure\n51.73%\n48.27%\na\nTennessee\n2014\nAmendment 1: No State Constitutional Right to Abortion and Legislative Power to Regulate Abortion Amendment\n52.60%\n47.40%\na\nFlorida\n2012\nAmendment 6: State Constitution Interpretation and Prohibit Public Funds for Abortions Amendment\n44.90%\n55.10%\nd\nMassachusetts\n1986\nQuestion 1: No State Constitutional Right to Abortion and Legislative Power to Regulate Abortion Amendment\n41.83%\n58.17%\nd\nGiroux, et al. v.

Brinkman JrDefendant(s): Committee representing petitioners, Sec. of State Frank LaRose, et al.Source: Ohio Supreme Court Ruling\nOn July 28, realtors Jennifer Giroux and Thomas E. Brinkman Jr filed a lawsuit with the Ohio Supreme Court against the committees representing the petitioners of the initiative. The lawsuit said that the initiative did not list the text of statutory provisions that would be repealed if the initiative were to be approved by voters, and therefore should must be invalidated.\nOn August 11, 2023, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit.

New voter laws and new voting machines also made things tough. \"At a couple of locations, it took them a few minutes to get the scanners up and running because these are brand new scanners so all of the procedures are new for our poll workers,\" West said. West said the scanner problems didn't cause any delays and all of the scanners were working properly. Summit County had similar scanner problems, but those were handled early in the day. The turnout for this election was higher than anticipated. Some Republican officeholders had said they expected the attention on Issue 1 would drive up turnout. Even so, the weekend before early voting began, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a primary backer of Issue 1, said he \"wouldn't be surprised\" if turnout was similar to last year's legislative primary. The turnout in that August 2022 vote was 7.9% statewide.\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nRead & Listen\nHome\nNews\nCulture\nMusic\nPodcasts & Shows\nConnect\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPress\nPublic Editor\nCorrections\nContact & Help\nAbout NPR\nOverview\nDiversity\nNPR Network\nAccessibility\nEthics\nFinances\nGet Involved\nSupport Public Radio\nSponsor NPR\nNPR Careers\nNPR Shop\nNPR Events\nNPR Extra\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nYour Privacy Choices\nText Only\nSponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor"
