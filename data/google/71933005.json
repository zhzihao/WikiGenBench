Considering the way they acted towards her previously, Taylor is relieved that karma will do her justice and may not be so kind with them.\nKarma, as a concept, has been a recurring theme throughout Taylor’s life and discography, especially surrounding her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian in 2016. It was also referenced in several songs on several albums, including “my tears ricochet” from folklore, “Look What You Made Me Do” from reputation, “Bad Blood” from 1989, “All Too Well (Taylor’s version)” and “I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor’s version)” from Red (Taylor’s version).\nOn the importance of karma in her life, Taylor mentioned it being the most important life lesson to be learned. One more interesting point to note is her reference to karma on her “The Man’s” music video, with a note saying “If found, return to Taylor Swift,” which sparked many rumors about a mystery album Taylor made called Karma. This secret album could be the reason she laughed when announcing the track’s title (Among so many other rumors).\nThe song’s mixture of drums, guitar and synth create a declaratory atmosphere, allowing Taylor to list all the ways fate will take its course. As a way of indicating its importance for her, she repeats the word karma throughout the chorus. She also repeatedly gives it different forms, showing the ways it can come back to serve fate.Expand +1102ShareQ&AFind answers to frequently asked questions about the song and explore its deeper meaningAsk a questionWhat have the artists said about the song?Genius Answer1 contributorOne of the themes about Midnights is how you’re feeling in the middle of the night, and that can be intense self-hatred, intense self-love; you go through these very polarizing emotions when you’re up late at night and your brain just spirals. It can spiral downward and it can spiral way up, and you can be really feeling yourself, and “Karma” is written from a perspective of feeling really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for going stuff right. It’s a song that I really love because I think we all need some of those moments, we can’t just be beating ourselves up all the time. You have to have these moments where you’re like, “You know what? Karma is my boyfriend,” and that’s it.\n— Taylor via iHeart RadioHow did the song perform commercially?Genius Answer1 contributorDuring the week ending November 5, 2022, the song debuted and peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100.
