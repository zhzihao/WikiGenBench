Joanne Witt was stabbed at least 20 times as she slept at her home in El Dorado Hills, California, in June 2009 Prior to her murder, the 47-year-old, who worked as a mechanical engineer, had reported that daughter Tylar (left) had been the victim of statutory rape by older lover Steven Colver (right)The horrific true story began in December 2008 when Joanne's daughter Tylar met Steven at a local coffee shop soon after she started ninth grade and he started college.The single mom, who was concerned about the age gap, was initially told that their bond was just a friendship and that Steven was gay.And Tylar soon convinced her mom to let Steven rent a room in the family home.Joanna reportedly told friends she thought the older boy could help her daughter with homework and that she could put the extra income toward the mortgage.But Joanne's father Norb told 48 Hours:'No one - every friend she had, everyone in the family - did not want him in there. But Joanne was very strong willed.'However, she later learned that the relationship had become sexual after walking in on the young couple in a compromising position.Joanne called two coworkers to help kick Steven out of the house and warned him to stay away from her daughter.But he appeared to be unfazed and would reportedly sneak back over to visit when Tylar's mom was at work or late at night when she was asleep. Joanna let Steven rent out a room in the family home (pictured) as she thought the older boy could help her daughter with homework and that she could put the extra income toward the mortgage The single mom later learned that the relationship between Tylar and Steven had become sexual after walking in on the young couple in a compromising position El Dorado County Sheriff Jeff Leikauf recounted that deputies carrying out a welfare check 'immediately discovered a female laying partially on a bed. She had been covered with a blanket, there was no movement, but there was a lot of blood'The pair had also begun dabbling in drugs together includingmarijuana, cocaine and ecstasy, according to reports.The situation proved to be too much for Joanne whowent to the police to report Steven for statutory rape following his sexual relationship with her underage daughter.She also handed over Tylar's diary, which was filled with 'very explicit writings of different sexual positions,' as proof of the encounters with Steven, according to Prosecutor Lisette Suder.Suder previously told CBS News: 'She wanted away from her daughter but they couldn't stand the thought of not being together and so that's when the plotting began.'Tylar was said to be angry at Joanne and devastated at the thought that her boyfriend may be sent to prison - which is when the pair decided to take action.The investigation into the sordid relationship was still ongoing when Joanne's own parents got a call from her boss to ask about her whereabouts after she failed to show up for work.The call immediately set off alarm bells for the retired couple and Joanne's boss revealed he had already called the sheriffs to request a welfare check because it was so out of character for the dedicated employee.El Dorado County Sheriff Jeff Leikauf recounted: 'Deputies were able to gain entry on the side of the house. They made their way up the stairs to the master bedroom.'They immediately discovered a female laying partially on a bed. She had been covered with a blanket, there was no movement, but there was a lot of blood.'Joannehad been stabbed at least 20 times with what police believed was a10-inch long chef's knife, but the weapon was never recovered. In 2011, as a result of her testimony, the then 16-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder and received a reduced sentence of 15 years to life in prison Steven, then 21, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without paroleSuder, who described the attack as 'very violent,' revealed: 'It was a very, very, very gruesome scene. There was a wound that almost decapitated her.'Tylar herself was nowhere to be found in the house and authorities soon realized that she had fled with Steven - sparking a manhunt.The couple had planned to kill themselves with rat poison on their four-month anniversary in the belief that Steven would be going to prison and had both prepared incriminating suicide notes.It is thought that they considered themselves akin to Shakespeare's doomed lovers Romeo and Juliet who died for their love - but theirinitial attempt had left Tylar with nothing but a stomach ache.Before attempt the plan again,the teens were discoveredby local officers 100 miles after stopping to change their clothes behind a dumpster at a mall.The pair eventually turned on each other during separate interrogations and the case later went to trial.Steven - who at one point had described to friends how he stabbed his girlfriend's mother with a butcher knife - changed his story.He claimed Joanne was already dead when he arrived at the home and claimed it was Tylar who stabbed her to death.Tylar's own story is that she had fallen to the floor before entering her mother's room and sat with her hands over her ears humming as Steven slaughtered Joanne.The jury rejected Steven's defense claims and Tylar agreed to testify against him in court.In 2011, as a result of her testimony, the then 16-year-old was convicted of second-degree murder and received a reduced sentence of 15 years to life in prison.She will be eligible for parole in 2024 aged 29.Steven, then 21, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.CaliforniaCrimeUS Femail Weekend Features Project\nShare or comment on this article:\nChilling case of young girl, 14, and her boyfriend, 19, who brutally slaughtered her mom after she reported him for statutory rape over the relationship\ne-mail\n174\nshares\nComments 144\nShare what you think\nBing\nSite\nWeb\nEnter search term:\nSearch\nDON'T MISS\nThe Traitors star Harry's famous girlfriend reveals she'll 'never trust him again' and her 'perception has changed' after he betrayed Paul\nEXCLUSIVEInside Kyle Walker's affair with Lauryn Goodman: Footballer lavished influencer with gifts in 'romance that spanned YEARS'\nEmily in Paris star Ashley Park, 32, reveals she nearly DIED after suffering tonsillitis that 'spiraled into critical septic shock' and 'infected her organs'\nLorraine Kelly, 64, looks incredible in a plunging swimsuit for a dip in the sea as fans praise the 'fabulous' TV host\nEXCLUSIVEThe Traitors villain Paul apologies to his influencer wife as he's inundated with messages from women lusting over his 'sexy' character\nGeorgina Rodriguez puts on a VERY busty display as she wows in white lace dress alongside Cristiano Ronaldo for Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai\nLove Island All Stars FIRST LOOK: Luis BLASTS 'p***k' Mitch for 's**t-stirring' and is ordered to lower his hands as they clash over Demi's affections\nLaura Anderson shows off incredible figure in skimpy peach cut-out swimsuit as she poses on a boat in eye-popping snap from recent Dubai trip\nKate Moss shares a giggle with daughter Lila as they join chic Rita Ora at star-studded Dior menswear show in Paris after celebrating her 50th birthday\nEXCLUSIVEKanye West's wife Bianca Censori 'pressured' rapper to film a 40-minute apology for anti-Semitic rantsk\nEXCLUSIVEBobby Brazier admits he felt so 'lost' after Strictly ended that he turned to eating ice cream at all hours of the day because he was struggling to cope\nInside Snoop Dogg's family: Meet the rapper's four beloved children and his wife and high school sweetheart Shante Broadus\nThe royal family have entered a 'new era' of transparency regarding their health as King Charles hopes to reduce stigma, royal experts tell PALACE CONFIDENTIAL\nDolly Parton drops four never-before-released tracks to mark her 78th birthday: 'Gonna give you a present!'\nChloe Madeley reveals ex James Haskell is FINALLY moving out of their marital home four months after split\nCristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez take centre stage at Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai as footballers and their WAGs\nLily Collins begins filming season four ofEmily in Paris... after the Hollywood writers' strike delayed shooting by two months\nKim Kardashian puts on a busty display in nude crop-top as she applies lipliner in sultry snaps for newly relaunched makeup line SKKN By Kim\nGMB's Charlotte Hawkins is red-faced as co-host Ben Shephard reveals she left her underwear in the studio\nKyle Walker's big moment: Footballer takes to the stage at Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai after his wife Annie Kilner left him\nEXCLUSIVEAlan Sugar says he got 'nothing' from The Apprentice contestants apart from 'excuses' in his most explosive interview yet\n6ft tall Gladiators star Diamond, 29, showcases her toned abdomen in black crop top as she leaves gym after workout\nKaren Hauer confirms romance with ex rugby player Simon Davidson as he arrives to support the dancer on first live show of Strictly tour in Birmingham\nPrincess Charlene shows off 90s-inspired pixie chop as she joins Prince Albert in Monte Carlo\nSheryl Lee Ralph and husband Vincent Hughes reveal they have 'no idea' why people are confused they don't live together\nYour ultimate guide to what to watch On Demand this weekend -

        "text": "'Juliet' Teen, Tylar Witt, Describes Her 'Romeo,' Steven Colver, Killing Mom - ABC News\nABC NewsVideoLiveShowsElection 2024538Interest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest? OffOnLOG INStream on'Juliet' Teen, Tylar Witt, Describes Her 'Romeo,' Steven Colver, Killing MomTeen couple allegedly carried out plot in bid to avert statutory rape charge.ByABC NewsJune 3, 2011, 5:56 PMJune 3, 2011 &#151; -- Tylar Witt told a courtroom this week that as a 14-year-old, she and her then-19-year-old boyfriend, Steven Colver, considered themselves a modern-day Romeo and Juliet.When her mother, Joanne Witt, threatened to have Colver charged with statutory rape, she testified, they concluded that like Shakespeare's doomed lovers they might have to die because of their passions.But instead of killing themselves, Tylar Witt testified Wednesday and Thursday, they hatched a plot to kill her 47-year-old mother while she slept -- and Colver allegedly went into the mother's El Dorado Hills, Calif., bedroom to carry it out on June 12, 2009, as she stood outside the door.A lawyer for Colver, now 21, has suggested Tylar Witt, not Colver, did the killing.However, prosecutors maintain Colver stabbed Joanne Witt at least 20 times, eventually killing her with a slash to the throat.\"I put my hands on my ears, closed my eyes, and hummed,\" Tylar Witt testified, according to unofficial court logs published by ABC News Sacramento, Calif., affiliate, KXTV.Witt, now 16, said that, at one point, her mother begged Colver to stop. Once there was silence, Colver emerged from the bedroom with blood-soaked pants and a single teardrop under his eye.\"He looked in shock,\" Witt said, according to KXTV's live blog of the court proceedings. \"I hugged him and told him everything was going to be OK.\"Witt told the court that the plot began when her mother gave the teen's diary containing explicit details of the teenage couple's sexual encounters to police as part of the statutory rape complaint against the older boyfriend.The couple met in December 2008 at a local coffee shop, she said, adding that the relationship quickly developed.\"He told me that he loved me and I realized that I felt the same way about him,\" Witt said. \"If he told me to jump off a bridge, I would have done it.\"Witt's mother initially approved of Colver, allowing him to move into the family home, she said, after Colver told her the relationship with her daughter was merely a brother-sister relationship.But things quickly changed as the two began using marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy, Witt said, adding that, eventually, the couple's relationship turned sexual.Soon, she said, her mother caught her naked in the Colver's room. Witt's mother kicked the boy out and forbade the relationship.Joanne Witt opened a statutory complaint against Colver. She took her daughter's diary and gave it to police.\"I went into a full-blown panic attack, hyperventilating, screaming, shaking,\" Tylar Witt said. \"Everything was in that diary. There was no way he was going to get out of the charges.\"The two teens discussed running away to San Francisco to commit suicide on their four-month anniversary.\"We had talked about the Romeo and Juliet scenario,\" Witt said, according KXTV's live blog of the court proceedings, \"He had said it would only be the last resort. I said it was the last resort.\"However, Witt said she knew her mom would call police if she went missing. She said the only way to follow through with their plan would to drug her mom.Witt said they planned to spike one of Joanne's alcohol bottles with drugs so she would fall asleep.The night of the murder, according to Witt's testimony, she had Colver meet her at the local school.\"We waited outside and smoked a couple cigarettes,\" Witt told the court, \"I felt really edgy. He had a knife, he showed it to me when we were standing outside.\"Colver brought a butcher knife from his restaurant job, she said.\"He was posing, sort of like practicing. He was about a foot and a half away from the bed,\" she continued, \"I stood up, I was in the doorway, I couldn't do it, I couldn't go inside.\"Top StoriesLos Angeles Innocence Project takes up case of notorious killer Scott PetersonJan 18, 6:42 PMMalia Obama makes red carpet debut at Sundance 20243 hours agoHBCU administrator's death by suicide prompts calls for president's resignationJan 19, 1:03 AM15 students and 1 teacher drown when a boat capsizes in a lake in western IndiaJan 18, 9:35 AMConcertgoers sue Madonna over show starting lateJan 18, 12:06 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC News"
