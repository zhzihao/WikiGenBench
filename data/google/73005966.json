Chinese national law has required most online service providers to implement real-name registration since 2012. This article uses the real-name registration rules to illustrate the supremacy and limitations of the Network Authoritarian Model (NAM), an approach leveraging corporate resources for political surveillance and occasionally adopted by the Chinese party-state. By addressing the evolution of real-name registration rules in China, this article illustrates the party-state’s gradual efforts in both eliminating cyberspace anonymity and etching Chinese characteristics on the architecture of the Internet. Although the Chinese government has faced serious challenges in enforcing the real-name registration policy and current enforcement is far from satisfactory, China is not alone in promoting such a policy. Major Internet companies, including Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, have expressed similar interests in requiring users to register their real names. Moreover, policymakers in developed and developing countries are exploring similarly themed regulations and China, therefore, may well be in the vanguard of the global movement for online real-name registration. Nonetheless, requiring real-name registration in China has not only created huge costs for Internet companies, but also given rise to fierce controversy associated with free speech, privacy, and law enforcement. In this article, we identify several important legal and policy implications of the Chinese real-name registration policy. We also illustrate the foremost predicament currently faced by the Chinese party-state in enforcing the policy. This analysis argues that China may create a “spillover effect” in jurisdictions outside China as well as in the global Internet architecture.\nKeywords: real-name registration, Internet, China, Network Authoritarian Model, anonymity, free speech, privacy\nSuggested Citation:\nSuggested Citation\nLee, Jyh-An and Liu, Ching-Yi, Real-Name Registration Rules and the Fading Digital Anonymity in China (January 20, 2016).

While China’s internet is heavily censored, owners of banned accounts have often resorted to registering new accounts, either on the same platform or another, by using names that are identical to the previous moniker they used.The CAC’s draft proposal directs internet platform operators to prohibit any re-registration of accounts that were previously closed for violating laws and regulations. These firms should also bar the holders of censored accounts from registering on another platform.\n09:40Tightened regulations among key trends shaping China’s internet in 2021Tightened regulations among key trends shaping China’s internet in 2021“This rule was mentioned in earlier campaigns,” said Wang Sixin, a law professor at Beijing’s Communication University of China (CUC). “This time it was put forward in the form of a normative document, which means it will become a routine operational requirement for all internet platforms.”The CAC’s draft proposal also directs online platform operators to display their users’ internet protocol address location at a significant place on their page.For domestic users, internet service providers must show in which province or city a user is located, according to the draft update. For overseas-based users, the internet platform operators must show the country they are located.Under the CAC proposal, internet platform operators must also delete users’ personal and account information soon after their accounts are cancelled.China started implementing a strict real-name registration system in 2017. This requires users of Chinese microblogging service Weibo and multipurpose social media platform WeChat, marketed as Weixin on the mainland, to authenticate their accounts with their national ID, mobile phone number and other relevant documents.Big Tech firms face brunt of China’s new push to clean up internet contentBeijing initially published rules on real-name registration in February 2015. This version asked internet account owners, including institutions or individuals, to provide their identity information when they register on platforms for microblogging and instant messaging.The CAC’s proposed update on real-name registration is based on existing rules and regulations, including China’s Cybersecurity Law, which was rolled out in 2017, and the Personal Information Protection Law, which will take effect on November 1.It highlights Beijing’s drive to create a “clean and healthy” cyberspace, free from information it deems harmful to society, which has recently come to include apolitical content such as stock market analysis and celebrity gossip. A set of guidelines issued by CAC in September emphasised that online platforms are responsible for managing their content, directing them to enhance self-censorship and the censorship of content generated by their legions of users.\nChina’s internet watchdog has been steadily tightening its grip on activities in the nation’s cyberspace. The CAC laid out a three-year plan to rein in the use of algorithms by app operators in September.The regulator also published a detailed 10-point notice, ordering China’s websites and apps to stop giving excessive exposure to celebrities and prohibiting their fans from forming online clubs. It has also started a campaign to clean up app alerts, specifically prohibiting those about celebrity gossip, violence and vulgar content.In August, the CAC launched a campaign to crack down on citizen journalists who “misinterpret economic policies and forecast doom and gloom in financial markets”. This action targeted certain websites and so-called self-media accounts – independently operated public social media accounts, typically on WeChat and Weibo – that have been accused of spreading rumours and using fake news to blackmail companies.“The internet has become the main battlefield of ideology,” the CUC’s Wang said. “The country will need to tighten up the process of publishing information, and providing details about the identification and location of the publisher, to make sure online services are being used legally.”This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: China updates rules on censored social media accounts in clean-up pushPost"

They’re following in the footsteps of microblogging site Weibo Corp., whose chief executive telegraphed the move by unmasking his own identity on his Twitter-like platform earlier this month.Have a confidential tip for our reporters?
