Lire en français Subscribers only Share Share Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Linkedin Copy link FeaturePrisoner exchanges have resumed after a five-month hiatus. Since the start of the conflict, over 2,000 Ukrainian service members, many of whom were tortured, have returned home. The families had been warned, as they were every time prisoners of war were exchanged with Russia: \"You probably won't recognize your husband or son. Hide your surprise. Or at least try to.\" Often wounded, victims of systematic torture and having lost up to half their body weight, those returning to them after months of captivity are mere shadows. On January 3, 230 Ukrainians were repatriated in exchange for 248 Russians, the largest exchange in terms of numbers since the start of the invasion. \"Every negotiation is unique, secret. Every lever is used, and I can only tell you it's never a 'gentleman's agreement.' But this time, the situation was really extreme,\" explained Petro Yatsenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War. While exchanges used to take place once a month on average, the process had been blocked since August 7, 2023, a delay so long that Kyiv had to build a second military detention center due to a rotation problem. The failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive this summer probably didn't help the country speed up negotiations. \"Talks are completely different when you're losing,\" said Iryna Bogdanova, an officer responsible for handovers with the Ukrainian General Staff. In this hybrid war, manipulation and dirty tricks are also part of the game. A rally for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war, in downtown Kyiv on January 7, 2024. RAFAEL YAGHOBZADEH FOR LE MONDE According to Kyiv, Moscow dragged out the negotiations in an attempt to fracture Ukrainian society by playing on the exasperation of prisoners' families. For months, they had been receiving phone calls from their relatives detained in Russia. They all mumbled the same message, obviously under duress: \"Go demonstrate everywhere against the authorities, they're the ones refusing to help us.\" Moscow is in no rush Moscow, on the other hand, is in no rush. The overwhelming majority of its captured soldiers are now those it sends to die on the front line: common-law convicts recruited in exchange for the promise of pardon or over-indebted fathers lured by a soldier's salary. \"For the Kremlin, these people don't count,\" said Petro Yatsenko from the Coordination Headquarters. He likes to recall the \"Viktor Medvedchuk affair,\" involving a pro-Russian Ukrainian oligarch close to President Vladimir Putin who was arrested for high treason in April 2022 and exchanged for 151 Ukrainian service members on September 22, 2022. Among them are also Chechen fighters: \"Catching one is like hitting the jackpot because you know that Grozny buys Ukrainian prisoners from Moscow to exchange their own as quickly as possible,\" Yatsenko continued. On the other hand, a Russian commander who had been captured with 10 of his men during the liberation of Kherson in November 2022 was struck off the exchange list by Moscow: As in the days of the Soviet Union, when caught, a ranking officer becomes a \"traitor.\" You have 70% of this article left to read.

(Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/AFP/Getty Images)Listen4 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveKYIV — Ukraine and Russia exchanged nearly 500 prisoners of war on Wednesday — including Ukrainian service members detained during fighting at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and on Snake Island in the Black Sea — one of the few areas of cooperation between the two sides.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt was the largest such exchange since the Russian invasion nearly two years ago, Ukraine’s coordination headquarters for POW issues said in a post on Telegram. Officials from the United Arab Emirates helped mediate the process, Russian and Ukrainian officials said.Ukrainian officials said that 230 of their service members returned home, while Russia said 248 of its POWs were released. Neither set of figures could be independently verified.“Over a significant period, we managed to conduct a very complex exchange,” said Kyrylo Budanov, chief of Ukraine’s military intelligence and head of the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.AdvertisementSpeaking in a video posted on social media, Budanov said the released Ukrainians included “a combat medic, defenders from Snake Island, Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Azovstal, border guards, police, national guard and armed forces — that is, absolutely all categories.”“This exchange has been prepared for a sufficiently long time,” he said.For its part, Russia’s Ministry of Defense said on Telegram that “all released Russian servicemen are being provided with the necessary medical and psychological assistance.”However, Russian human rights commissioner Tatyana Moskalkova said 75 of the Russian POWs were handed back “without an exchange,” the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported — implying that the main trade involved 173 Russian service members.RIA quoted an unnamed “source” as saying that the 75 Russians were released in exchange for five Ukrainian commanders from the Azov Brigade who returned to Ukraine in July.AdvertisementThe Azov members had been captured by Russian forces early in the war and reportedly were under house arrest under Turkey’s supervision. RIA said the commanders returned to Ukraine “in violation of all agreements.”Share this articleShareOn Wednesday, photos and videos posted on social media showed the Ukrainian POWs, many with Ukrainian flags draped across their shoulders, being greeted on their return and singing their national anthem.“Our are home,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted on Telegram, announcing the news of the exchange. “We will do everything to return all our people who are currently in Russian captivity.”Petro Yatsenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s POW coordination headquarters, said seven Ukrainian service members who had been released were taken prisoner while fighting on Snake Island — the location of a strategic Ukrainian base in the Black Sea that Russian forces seized in the first days of the war.AdvertisementThe garrison there gained international fame after its soldiers reportedly responded with an expletive to a Russian ship’s demand to surrender.Yatsenko also said that 12 of those who returned were taken prisoner at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works — a sprawling industrial complex in the southern city of Mariupol that became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance. Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters and civilians held out against a months-long Russian siege, eventually succumbing in May 2022..The prisoner exchange brings some cheer to Ukraine’s east, where the two sides have settled into brutal trench warfare and artillery battles, eking out only small territorial gains.Over the New Year’s holidays, Russian forces launched drone and missile strikes that killed dozens and injured hundreds across Ukraine, inflicting damage beyond the front lines in a vicious show of force.In a recent interview with the Economist, Zelensky said he didn’t see “any fundamental steps forward to the peace from Russia” that could lead to negotiations. Instead, he said, he saw “only the steps of a terrorist country.”Serhiy Morgunov in Warsaw and Robyn Dixon and Natalia Abbakumova in Riga, Latvia, contributed to this report.What to know about Ukraine’s counteroffensive The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.The fight: Ukrainian troops have intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.How you can help: Here are ways those in the United States can support the Ukrainian people as well as what people around the world have been donating.Read our full coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war.
