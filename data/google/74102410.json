A MONTH LATER, THE PHILIPPINES SCANDAL REFUSES TO GO AWAY Add to list On my list By William Branigin William Branigin Reporter and editor covering breaking news Email Bio July 18, 1994 MANILA, JULY 17 -- The First Lady was mortified. A terrorist hit squad threatened retribution. And now political commentators are rewriting scenarios for future elections. Nearly a month after the rigging of a film festival awards ceremony, the scandal continues to reverberate. The \"filmfest scam,\" as the affair has been dubbed, has burgeoned here into the pretrial-publicity equivalent of the O.J. Simpson case and spurred local pundits into paroxysms of self-abuse. \"Are we a nation of cheats?\" asked an editorial in a leading newspaper. \"Are we a dishonest, lying, cheating people?\" The scandal \"shattered dreams, punctured illusions, transformed heroes and heroines into heels, grandees into gremlins, role models into hooligans,\" effused former presidential press secretary Teodoro Benigno. \"It showed, as nothing else could show, the moral rot and depravity in our society.\" Well, maybe. But the public outrage over the scam also showed that ordinary Filipinos are fed up with cheating and won't take it anymore -- at least when it's so insultingly brazen. The films of the accused movie stars and managers -- now known as \"the Filmfest Seven\" -- have been banned in various cities, and Philippine movies generally have been taking a beating at the box office in the wake of the scandal. \"Crowds which used to ooh and aah whenever an actress or actor stalked by now turn up their noses,\" said publisher and columnist Max V. Soliven. The affair has overshadowed a controversy over a new value-added tax, diverted attention from a major speech by President Fidel Ramos and deflected efforts to promote the Philippines as a new economic \"tiger cub\" in Southeast Asia. Ramos's wife, Amelita, complained that the \"shameful and unfortunate\" fiasco had embarrassed her during a recent two-week trip to Europe to promote tourism and investment here. It seemed the scam was on everybody's lips and, she felt, had tarnished not only the perpetrators but the \"dignity of the entire Filipino nation.\" Although the Philippine media have been having a field day with the scam and television comedy shows have been spoofing it mercilessly, the First Lady's remarks prompted some commentators to blame the foreign press for spreading the story around and sullying the country's image abroad. Soon it seemed that everyone was getting into the act. The Alex Boncayao Brigade, an urban assassination squad of the Philippines' long-running communist rebel movement, threatened to mark the Filmfest Seven for \"people's revolutionary justice\" -- meaning curtains -- if they did not draw prison terms. That prompted a bit of a backlash in itself. \"Since when has revolutionary justice extended to assassinating second-rate film festival cheats?\" demanded the Manila Times in an editorial. If the brigade must break into show business, it said, \"we suggest an alternative: why not assassinate all those producers who keep turning out inane movies?\" Teodoro L. Locsin Jr., the publisher of Today newspaper, was even more indignant. \"Every {expletive} crook in this country is making himself feel good because of the cheap trick they tried to pull at the Manila Film Festival,\" he wrote. Addressing the Alex Boncayao Brigade, he added, \"You stupid sons of bitches. Go kill a crook in government first.\" Political analysts said the scam may serve to throttle a growing trend toward electing movie stars, comedians, basketball players and other celebrities to public office. The current vice president, Joseph \"Erap\" Estrada, is a burly former matinee idol, and two of the top vote-getters in the 1992 Senate elections were a former slapstick comic and an action-movie star. Now some pundits are touting Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, who exposed the scandal, for president in 1998. It may be a bit early for this sort of handicapping, however. And Lim, a former police general known as the Philippines' \"Dirty Harry,\" is hardly considered a saint either. The scandal started when Ruffa Gutierrez, a 20-year-old beauty queen who finished third in the Miss World pageant last year, and Nanette Medved, a young actress whose father was an American serviceman here, jointly announced the name of Gabby Concepcion as the winner of the trophy for best actor at the June 22 Manila Film Festival awards ceremony. The announcement baffled the judges and an accounting firm that had tabulated their votes, since Concepcion, Ruffa's costar in a local knockoff of the Lorena Bobbitt story, had actually come in a distant third. But before anyone could intervene, the nationally televised show went on with the announcement of the best-actress winner by a trio of presenters: actress Gretchen Barretto, Rocky Gutierrez (Ruffa's 17-year-old brother) and Viveka Babajee, 20, an aspiring starlet who had represented Mauritius in the Miss Universe beauty pageant here in May. As Barretto started to read the result from an official letter, Babajee, a house guest of the Gutierrez family, shouted, \"Ruffa Gutierrez!\" and whispered to Rocky, \"Take it, take it.\" He then pocketed the paper, and his gushing sister received the trophy. Informed after the show by the accounting firm that the wrong winners had been announced, Lim called the audience back, denounced the \"hoax\" and proclaimed the rightful awardees as Edu Manzano for best actor and Aiko Melendez for best actress. He also demanded the return of the trophies and ordered a police investigation. Amid a mounting public outcry, Miss Mauritius, dubbed \"Miss Malicious\" by the press here, fled to Hong Kong and has not been heard from since. After initially refusing to return the trophies, Ruffa Gutierrez and Lolita Solis, Concepcion's manager, gave them back at Lim's office when they showed up for a formal inquiry. Gutierrez was composed at first as she coolly declared she was returning the trophy \"with malice to none and charity to all.\" But she ended up wailing hysterically as she tried to escape an angry crowd with the help of Robin \"Bad Boy\" Padilla, her costar in a new movie. He is out on bail while appealing a conviction for illegal possession of firearms. A round of finger-pointing then ensued among the Filmfest Seven, who include Ruffa, brother Rocky, mother-manager Anabelle Rama, Concepcion, Medved, Solis and Babajee. They have been charged with fraud, deceit, grave scandal and obstruction of justice, which carry jail terms of four months to six years. Immigration authorities also began looking into the residency status of Medved and Concepcion, who are said to be U.S. citizens. After Medved and Concepcion dumped Solis as their manager, the acid-tongued impresario lashed back by attesting she had organized the scam, and that her former wards -- but not the Gutierrezes -- were in on it. \"I am guilty. I am the mastermind. I am sorry,\" Solis confessed publicly. She claimed she did it for Concepcion, who had \"instigated\" the plot and whom she loved like a son. \"I just wanted to make him happy,\" she said. Few believed her assertion that she had somehow switched the envelopes, however, and fewer still seemed to give much credence to Ruffa Gutierrez. She has contended that she unwittingly read the switched best-actor result, a claim contradicted by Medved's admission that they both deliberately announced the wrong name as part of the plot. So steadfastly has Gutierrez professed her innocence, some wits now say, that perhaps she deserves the best-actress award after all William Branigin William Branigin writes and edits breaking news.

Ano yun, e…” pagkunot-noo ng 75-anyos na si Lolit.\n“Actually, alam mo si Gretchen, kikay lang pero pag aanuhin mo, soft-hearted. Kasi, ano 'yan, e. Noong panahon kay Mother Lily… di ba, sabay sila ni Nadia Montenegro?\n“Si Mother, pag nag-a-assign, ang on top of us, si Douglas . Tapos, kami nina Rod Samson noon, ina-assign-assign ni Mother.\n“Pipili ka. ‘Lolit, sino ang gusto mo sa dalawa?’ Ang pinili ko, si Nadia. Ang ganda-ganda talaga ni Nadia, di ba? Tapos, hindi pa ganun kataba.\n“Tapos si Gretchen talaga, ‘Ba’t siya ang pinili mo?’ Ano siya… may good memories ako sa kanya.”\nNagbida sina Gretchen, Nadia, at Janice de Belen sa 1984 Regal movie na 14, Going Steady na idinirek ni Joey Gosiengfiao.\nNasa cast din nito sina JC Bonnin, Benedict Aquino, Mon Alvir, at Albert Anido. Ang producer ay si Mother Lily Monteverde.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓\nSa paglaganap ng pandemya, napaka-generous ni Gretchen sa pamamahagi ng ayudang love box para sa mga taga-showbiz.\n“Siya lang ang nakadiskubre ng love box!” maigting na bulalas ni Lolit.\n“Sa lahat, di ba? Siya lang ang nag-introduce ng love box. Wala nang iba.\n“Ako, may mga hawak ako na artistang pulitiko. Isinumbat-sumbat ko iyon kina Bong , ‘Ni hindi ninyo naisipan 'yan?! Ang nakaisip niyan, si Gretchen Barretto?!’\n“Di ba?! For that alone, kailangan talagang nasa isip natin siya. Di ba, siya lang ang nakaisip nun?!\n“Kaya yung ibang questions, ‘Galing sa ano 'yan, galing sa sabong!’ achu-chu-chu-chu.\n“Kahit saan galing yun, the mere fact na naisipan niyang i-share sa atin, that’s something.”\nMilyun-milyon ang halaga ng love boxes (food ayuda) na ipinamudmod ni Gretchen. Nakatanggap maski na ang mga hindi niya kakilala. Pinagbigyan din ni Gretchen ang mga nag-request ng wheelchair.\n“At wala siyang pinili! Kahit sino! Kung ano ang ibinigay niya dun sa artistang ito, yun din ang ibinigay sa yo,” pagdidiin ni Manay Lolit.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓\n“To the point na tinatawagan pa ako ni Tonton Gutierrez, ‘Nay, sabihin mo naman kay Gretchen, padalhan ako.’\n“Naiinggit kasi yung isang anak niya sa anak ni Pauleen dahil nakitang pinadalhan ng malaking-malaking lollipop.\n“Gustong manghingi ng lollipop, e, hindi pinadalhan ng ganun. Siguro, wala sa isip ni ano, at alam niya, dalagita na ang anak nina Tonton at Glydel .\n“E, gustong manghingi. Kaya tinawagan ko, ‘Gretch, kawawa naman yung anak ni Tonton, nainggit sa anak ni ano…’”\nGABBY CONCEPCION\nWagas ang pagmamahal noon ni Lolit sa alaga niyang si Gabby Concepion. Handa siyang ilaban ito ng patayan.\nAniya, nagawa niya ang scam dahil sa pagmamahal niya kay Gabby. Kinamuhian din ba niya noon si Gabby nang nag-testify ito laban sa kanya? She felt betrayed?\n“Hindi… Ako naman talaga, admitted ako, isa sa mga perfect na alaga, si Gabby,” pagngiti ni Lolit na may bahid ng pait.\n“Talagang ano, saka by nature, mabait talaga. Yun nga lang siguro, baka wala siyang lakas ng loob na…\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓\n“In fairness, all throughout noong scam noon, yung tatay ni Gabby na si Rollie Concepcion, kumokontak pa sa akin.\n“Talagang chu-chu-chu-chu. Parang worried siya na magalit ako kay Gabby dahil yun nga, parang… binetray ako, di ba?\n“Nung ano nga, ang ano pa niya, ‘Lolit, pwede bang ikaw uli ang mag-handle kay Gabby?’\n“Sabi ko, ‘Dad naman, ang pangit naman nun!’ Siyempre, kahit papaano, wala na ang respeto namin sa isa’t isa.\n“Wala na! ‘Hayaan mo na yun,’ tsuk.”\nSi Gabby ang leading man ni Sanya Lopez sa Kapuso primetime series na First Lady, ang pinaka-sakalam na serye sa local television, ayon sa AGB Nielsen NUTAM Ratings.\nAng kasalukuyang manager ni Gabby ay si Popoy Caritativo.\nRUDY FERNANDEZ & BONG REVILLA\nAyaw raw ni Lolit na madamay sa kasalanan niya ang mga alagang artista, kaya gusto niya noong lumayo sa mga ito.\n“Ang bilib na bilib ako noon, not for anything, kay Rudy . Baka naman dahil mature din sila,” salaysay ni Lolit.\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓\nAlaga ni Lolit sina Rudy at Bong, pati si Nanette Medved na presenter sa kategoryang best actor ng MFF 1994.\nPagpapatuloy ni Lolit, “Alam ko na nun, may political ambition ang dalawa. Kaya sabi ko, ‘Huwag, huwag kayong ano…’\n“Pero hindi. Hindi mo pa rin sila napigilan, si Bong saka si Rudy. Sabi nila, ‘Kung dahil lang diyan, maaano kami… hindi ka naman namin igi-give up.’\n“Ganun, di ba? Talagang dumadalaw pa rin sila sa hospital. Ipinapakita pa rin… Yun talaga ang naka-save, na talagang grateful na grateful ako dun.”\nGusto nang mamatay noon ni Lolit. Gusto niyang mag-suicide.\nNatawa si Lolit, “Sabi nga ni Douglas, ‘Naku, ha?! Ikaw talaga kasi!’ Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! ‘Ang dami-dami mong gagawin…’ sabi niyang ganun. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\n“Sabi talaga ni Douglas, ‘Kung alam ko lang na kailangan mo ng award, ihiningi na lang sana kita kay Charito Solis!’ Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\nADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ↓\nHOT STORIES\nRead Next\nRead More Stories About\nLolit Solis,\nManila Film Festival 1994,\nManila Film Festival 1994 scam,\nGretchen Barretto,\nGabby Concepcion,\nRuffa Gutierrez,\nEdu Manzano,\nViveka Babajee,\nRocky Gutierrez,\nRudy Fernandez,\nBong Revilla,\nDouglas Quijano,\nTonton Gutierrez\nPEP Live\nPost a Comment\nFeatured\nLatest Stories\nTrending in Summit Media Network\nClose\n© 2024 Philippine Entertainment Portal Inc.
