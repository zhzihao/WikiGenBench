But it felt very safe inside the hotel. Father David and staff were so kind and helpful. Entire place especially the rooftop was beautiful and you had an awesome view of the city.

We met a friendly priest at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher who told us about the Notre Dame Guest House. It was a Sunday evening, and we were looking for a mass. He recommended Notre Dame. We attended a beautiful service and then explored the facility. We returned the following night for dinner, saw our priest friend again, took photos of his group on the rooftop, and joined them for mass at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher the following days. We looked at brochures showing us the rooms at the Notre Dame Guest House, which looked lovely. The grounds are beautiful, the staff friendly, and it has two restaurants, a coffee shop, and a chapel where they say mass. It's perfect. Additionally, it's across the street from the New Gate into Old Jerusalem. It's a great location. …Read moreDate of stay: September 2023ValueLocationServiceTrip type: Traveled as a coupleThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

The rooms are so small. The buffet food was also not up to standards; the little meat that they served was dry. No flavor in the other selections. The place needs a pool or somewhere where pilgrims could relax after a long day of a lot of walking. It was such a let down after staying a few days in Magdala where the accommodations were so well done. I recommend that the hotel provide a listing of local restaurants, places to get food, and local attractions in Jerusalem. I had to venture out to get something to eat because the food was so bad and flavorless. The fifth floor upscale restaurant had food that was delish. I can’t understand why the food was so bad at the buffet.Read moreDate of stay: October 2023ValueLocationServiceTrip type: Traveled with friendsRoom Tip: Research other area restaurants to eat before you go; the food at the 0 floor buffet has no...See more room tipsThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Check-in was easy as they had keys for everyone after we got off the bus; we were offered a welcome cold drink on a hot day; the staff are friendly; the buffet meals are great; and their Wine and Cheese restaurant on the rooftop has magnificent views of the city.

Very clean and quiet. Breakfast buffet is plentiful with good wait staff. The Chapel on the first floor is quite beautiful. Front desk staff, especially Abeer, is friendly and helpful. Only negatives are that it is popular with large church groups which can be congested at times, especially breakfast. Also, the well- known rooftop wine/cheese lounge requires reservations, even from registered guests.

In 1893, five years after Notre Dame received its first pilgrims, the cornerstone for the chapel was laid. And in 1904, after 20 years of unceasing construction, the marvelous nave was completed and the outside of the church was crowned with a statue of the Virgin Mary. During the War of Independence the building sustained heavy damage; a part of it was destroyed by explosions and became a guard post.\nHowever, even after the situation quieted down, the center could no longer cope with the prohibitive maintenance costs, and was eventually turned over to the Vatican. Pope John Paul VI took the project under his wing, and in the late 1970's, Notre Dame reopened as the Holy See's international pilgrim center.\nThese days, Notre Dame is mostly used as a boutiqueguesthousefor pilgrims, whooften attend the daily mass at 6:30 pm.google reviews4.6based on 1359 traveler reviewsRoxavgeekSeptember 14, 2023Amazing hotel with perfect location, next to the holy city, incredible view from the rooftop.
