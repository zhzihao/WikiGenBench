Production purposely causes drama. I've watched every season faithfully including the live feeds. After last season, I said I'm done. All these months later in 2023, I was hoping the show would be canceled. It caused way more harm and discourse than it is worth. I will have no part of it going forward other than to rate the show as a huge failure in civility.\nShow Less\nShow More\nMichele\nOct 06, 2022\nIt was going on just fine until they decided to focus on race again.\nShow Less\nShow More\nP W\nSep 27, 2022\nThe season was tame until the incredible \"Leftover Takeover\" in Week 3. This left me with my expectations high for the rest of the season, but shortly after this the season declined as outside factors began to slightly tarnish the season as expected.\nShow Less\nShow More\nSep 27, 2022\nHaving watched BB since inception I can honestly say the last 2 seasons have been good but not great, after losing interest this season I looked up ratings and noticed that ratings have declined, the article stated it was due to racism towards POC yet so far I see nothing supporting it. Maybe people are just tired of BB or possibly tired of racism being injected into everything. My2cents for what its worth\nShow Less\nShow More\nSpawn\nJul 31, 2022\nAnother typical group of young self absorbed attention seeking \"young\" people looking to somehow make it big. As usual they have checked every \"diversity\" box when it comes to contestants. Then we get to listen to them moan about their own personal hardships in dealing with their diversity. Blah blah blah.... Oh how I long for the old days of just putting a show together without all of the PC garbage.\nShow Less\nShow More\nmike p\nJul 06, 2022\nThe greatest 10 episodes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
