        "text": "Criste Greening faces Scott Krug for the 72nd Assembly District seatSkip to main content\nHomeElectionsNewsInvestigationsNational PoliticsUSA TODAY\nMeet the candidates running for Wisconsin's 72nd Assembly District seat in the November electionJennifer Poyer\n|Wisconsin Rapids Daily TribuneIncumbent Scott Krug, a Republican, will face Democratic challenger Criste Greening on Nov. 8 for the 72nd State Assembly District seat. Krug is seeking his seventh term in office.The 72ndAssembly District coverssoutheastern Wood County, including Wisconsin Rapids,part of southern Portage County, the northern half of Adams County and the western half of Waushara County.To learn more about registering to vote and tofind your polling location, visitMy Vote Wisconsin.The Wisconsin RapidsDaily Tribune and Stevens Point Journal asked each of the candidates to address important issues in the district and why they believe they are the best candidate for the position.Scott KrugAge: 47City of residence: Town of RomeOccupation: Realtor, legislator, county board supervisorCampaign website: krugforwisconsin.usCriste GreeningAge: 47City of residence: SaratogaOccupation: Former educatorCampaign website: www.greeningforassembly.comWhy are you running for office?Krug: I love helping constituents solve problems that the bureaucracy creates. Whether it’s helping a single mom advocate for the help she needs to raise her family or helping a family building a home cut through the red tape of permitting, it’s rewarding to be of service to my community.Greening: I am running because I believe the 72nd deserves representation that is a true reflection of the values of our collective communities. This is not currently happening in our district. I am ready to listen to constituents, hear concerns and ideas, and put those thoughts into action for the 72nd.What makes you the better candidate?Krug: I only talk about my own path forward and don’t dismiss other people and their motives. My greatest accomplishments in the legislature all involve solving local problems and staying away from needing to generate headlines and the nastiness of the politics of personal attacks.Greening: My record as both an independent voter and thinker, my ability to reach across the aisle, my dedication to show up and do the needed work, and my belief that true representation of the people must be brought back to Wisconsin politics is what makes me the better candidate.What is the most pressing issue facing Wisconsin, and how would you address it?Krug: Easily the most pressing issue right now is inflation. Looking to pump gas at $4 per gallon and grocery bills that are 30-40% higher than last year is a daunting endeavor for families in Wisconsin. Costs on everything from building homes to maintaining local roads are through the roof, and we are at a breaking point for many families and businesses right now.Agriculture and tourism suffer dramatically when prices increase. The ripple effect on our economy is immense. Every day voters talk to me about how we need to change course on inflation, and controlling excessive government spending is the way.Greening: While speaking with constituents across the 72nd, affordable health care has been the number one issue of concern spanning all ages and genders. Since identifying this as the people's primary concern, I responded by making affordable health care a top priority.Wisconsin’s Republican-led majority continues to sacrifice the health of our citizens by refusing to accept Federal Medicaid Expansion funds totaling $1.1 billion (2014-19) and $1.6 billion (2021) simply due to partisan politics. We can start addressing affordable health care by accepting these federal funds, putting egos aside and working together for the betterment of all Wisconsin citizens.Would you vote to repeal Wisconsin’s ban on abortions or to add exemptions to the law?Krug: This will certainly be one of the main issues the legislature will tackle after the election. I am pro-life and I believe that we should have exceptions for the life of the mother and cases of rape and incest. Those guidelines will help me voice my opinion and that of the majority of my constituents in the upcoming session.Avoiding extreme positions like abortion up to the point of birth, abortion based on gender or abortion of children with developmental disorders can never be allowed. I’m dismayed to see so many Democrats statewide and nationally advocating for such extreme measures.Greening: I would vote to repeal Wisconsin’s 1849 law banning abortions. This law was enacted 70 years before women even had a right to vote, when they were still considered property of their father or spouse. We should not so easily erase decades of hard-fought progress on women’s rights by a stroke of a pen.I do not support governmental policies interfering with an individual's rights to determine their personal reproductive care nor do I believe any singular religious organization should influence the direction of state policy for all citizens. I unapologetically support a woman’s right to choose.Are the public schools in your district properly funded?Krug: Yes. This past session Wisconsin used over $2.5 billion in federal funds to supplement K-12 budgets statewide. This is in addition to increased funding each of the last nine years. We’ve allocated additional aid to schools with high poverty numbers, high transportation costs, as well as for school safety and mental health measures.Wisconsin now funds special education at the highest dollar amount in our history. Continuing to support education, particularly in helping students catch up after COVIDshutdowns, is imperative to our future success as a state. Accountability and transparency must also be addressed.Greening: As a former teacher I can unequivocally state our local public schools continue to be underfunded. Wisconsin public school districts have yet to recover from Walker era budget cuts that slashed funding by $426 million in 2011. Although funding has been partially restored in each biennial state budget since 2011, we are yet to reach levels appropriate to address today's ever-increasing needs.Additionally, the escalating monies removed from public schools and funneled to private voucher and charter school programs is increasing yearly and prioritized over public school funding, marginalizing any increased support established through state education budgets.How should state government help Wisconsin residents combat the effects of inflation?Krug: Historically high inflation has families struggling. If our latest budget projections hold up (and are not swallowed by inflation), the state will be able to lessen the burden. The best way to do that is stop taking so much of their hard-earned money. Lower tax rates in times of surplus are first steps.Lowering the burden on businesses by overhauling the personal property tax will help, then lessen the burden on consumers as well. Smart government spending and making tough choices (like all families have to do) has served as a model I’d like to continue working under.Greening: Wisconsin currently has a $5 billion budget surplus sitting unused because of partisan politics playing out in our state capitol. Wisconsin is in the strongest financial position it has been in decades, yet our Republican-led majority refuses to access or spend surplus funds to benefit Wisconsin citizens.Our legislature should be working to put in place meaningful changes that utilize available funds to ease the burden on citizen wallets. Actions such as ones currently proposed by Governor Evers: cutting taxes, increasing the child tax credit to 100% of federal limits, and capping insulin prices at $35 are all viable options.MORE ELECTION NEWS: Wisconsin U.S. Senate election updates: Scalise continues criticism of Barnes' 2017 tweet, Johnson cuts adMORE ELECTION NEWS:Group reports $55 million in TV ad buys in Wisconsin governor's race, making it most expensive in the country\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmailHelpTerms of ServiceSubscription Terms & ConditionsPrivacy PolicySite MapAccessibilityOur Ethical PrinciplesResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices\n© Copyright Gannett 2024"
