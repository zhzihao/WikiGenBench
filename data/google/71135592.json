The actors did all of the chopping and prep.ConnectionsFeatured in Jeremy Vine: Episode #5.220 (2022)User reviews743ReviewReviewFeatured review8/10 Pretty GoodThe Bear is just as good as all these reviews are saying it is. I wasn't sure what to expect and the plot sounds like it might be kind of boring but it was anything but. It's an exciting, behind the scenes look at a demanding restaurant business in Chicago. The show will grab you and pull you in until the next thing you know you binged the entire season. I liked Jeremy Allen White (Lip) from Shameless and after reading all the great reviews I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did. It's just an extremely well written dramedy and the acting is so that they will really make you root for these characters to succeed. This is a show that will keep you entertained throughout each episode. I hope to see future seasons.helpful•344Supermanfan-13Nov 17, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ17How many seasons does The Bear have?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJune 23, 2022 (Hong Kong)Country of originUnited StatesOfficial sitesOfficial InstagramOfficial TwitterLanguagesEnglishSpanishAlso known asВедмідьFilming locations666 North Orleans Street, Chicago, Illinois, USA(restaurant)Production companiesFX ProductionsSuper FrogSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime30 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby Surround 7.1Aspect ratio16:9 HDRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageAdd episodeMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksListThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2024See the listListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.While The Bear just devoured at the 81st Annual Golden Globeses by taking home five awards, including best comedy, fans have quite the appetite. Last season of the culinary dramedy left viewers in a cacophony of yelling, uneasy stomachs and a \"chaos menu\" indicative of the cooks firing up the dishes. Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) sabotages his relationship with Claire (Molly Gordon), seemingly resigned to the belief that he needs to be unhappy to be successful. Despite everything, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) finds affirmation in her pursuit to win The Bear a Michelin star, as Carmy warns her of the cost: \"You're going to have to care about everything more than anything.\"For those hungry for more, here's everything we know about whether The Bear will re-open for season 3. Will there be a season 3 of The Bear?View full post on InstagramYes, chef! FX renewed The Bear for season 3 as of last November. Considering its marked critical acclaim, it's not the biggest surprise. In fact, Deadline reported that the latest installment was the most-watched premiere of any FX series on Hulu. While we await more sizzling details, hit the \"save\" button at the top of this article to bookmark the page and return for more The Bear updates.Do we know The Bear season 3 release date yet?Official dates have yet to be confirmed, but no need to call mom just yet. When promoting his film The Iron Claw, Jeremy Allen White stopped by the Today show and gave a better timeline for season 3.\"I think we're going to get started up in like February, March,\" he says. \"I'm going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills,\" he said.For reference, season 2's filming began last February in Chicago, Illinois, per Collider. All 10 episodes of the last season premiered in summer 2023. So, here's hoping that season 3 is similarly just around the corner.View full post on XDo we know who will be in The Bear season 3 cast?Should The Bear return, the usual list of characters from previous seasons includes:Jeremy Allen White as CarmyAyo Edebiri as SydneyEbon Moss-Bachrach as Richie Abby Elliott as NatalieLionel Boyce as MarcusLiza Colón-Zayas as Tina Matty Matheson as Neil FakEdwin Lee Gibson as EbraOliver Platt as Uncle Jimmy Chris Witaske as PeteView full post on InstagramThe epic \"Fishes\" episode alone stirred up a number of surprise guest appearances, including the likes of Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Will Poulter, Olivia Colman and John Mulaney. Whether or not those actors return depends on where the story goes. Appearing in flashbacks for both seasons, Carmy and Natalie's late brother Michael (Jon Bernthal) is likely to make a comeback. What's more, season 2 newcomer Molly Gordon may continue her role if Carmy mends his relationship with Claire. Who knows, Jamie Lee Curtis could also return to play the siblings' mother Donna. While he admitted he'd love to see Olivia and Jamie Lee reprise their roles, Jeremy admitted to Deadline that his dream guest stars include Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri's Sam Rockwell and The Big Lebowski's John Turturro. Do we know what The Bear season 3 will be about?Season 2 ended on Friends and Family Night but not without a hitch. The next chapter will likely follow Carmy and company as they open for business, with a mere few months to turn a profit and pay off Uncle Jimmy's loan. Otherwise, the Bear closes up shop for good.'The Bear''The Bear'Watch Now on HuluWith Carmy accidentally locked in the walk-in fridge and sabotaging his relationship with Claire, we're bound to explore where they stand in the aftermath. That consequentially led to a tense standoff with Richie, too. Sydney and Carmy might also be on a slow burn that could ignite in the episodes to come. It also unpacked Carmy's family trauma. In the season's longest episode, viewers witnessed a flashback set at the Berzatto family's Feast of the Seven Fishes. Insults were hurled, as were forks ... shortly followed by a car driven into a house. In the present, Pete, unknowingly, is the one to tell Donna of Natalie's pregnancy. We wouldn't be surprised if the season continues to dive further into their family history. As for Carmy's relationship with Sydney, fans continuously voice how they want the friends to possibly pursue a romance with one another. While anything is possible with The Bear, Ayo Edibiri weighed in on the speculation during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike.Courtesy of Hulu\"It's really not our thought process when we're making the show, and I understand it can be part of a show's culture,\" she explained to the outlet. \"But I don’t think they’re going to get what they want.\" For those wondering what happens between Carmy and Claire once he leaves the fridge? Jeremy recently responded to those heated inquiries while at the 2024 Golden Globes.\"I truly have no idea,\" he said, \"As Jeremy, reader of scripts and watcher of show, I think Claire is so lovely and kind to Carmy. I think she deserves an apology at the very least. So, I hope there's some version of that when I read the scripts.\"Where can I watch and stream The Bear?You can stream all episodes of The Bear exclusively on Hulu.
