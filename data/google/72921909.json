Equal parts Blakean mysticism and biblical resonance, the song abandons the self-righteousness that plagued Dylan’s religious work to offer a desperate prayer for salvation. Shadowing Dylan on vocals is gospel great (and Dylan flame) Clydie King: “I get chills when I hear her just breathe,” Dylan said. “Every Grain of Sand” taps into a moving humility (“Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me,” he sings). As Bono puts it, “Dylan stops wailing against the world, turns on himself and is brought to his knees.”\nDylan later described “Every Grain of Sand” as “an inspired song that just came to me…. I felt like I was just putting words down that were coming from somewhere else.”\nRELATED:\n• Bob Dylan’s Greatest Collaborations\n‘Visions of Johanna’\nImage Credit: Jan Persson/Redferns/Getty Images\n‘Mr. Tambourine Man’\nImage Credit: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, Inc\n‘It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)’\nImage Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n‘I Shall Be Released’\nImage Credit: Thomas Monaster/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n‘All Along the Watchtower’\nImage Credit: Chris Wood/Express/Getty Images\n‘Just Like a Woman’\nImage Credit: Fiona Adams/Redferns/Getty Images\nBlonde On Blonde, 1966\nDylan‘s finest ballad is not a love song. “Just Like a Woman” is a complex portrait of adoration and disappointment, written as vengeance but sung as regret. Dylan never revealed a specific inspiration for the woman indicted. (Dylanologists often cite Andy Warhol’s star-crossed protégée Edie Sedgwick.) But the song is more about his own turbulent lessons in romance — the giving, taking and leaving. It is also Dylan’s first great country-rock performance. Dylan was making thunder and headlines onstage that year with the Hawks, but he cut this song with Nashville session cats who heard and heightened his tangle of rapture and despair. “There’s a lifetime of listening in these details,” songwriter Jimmy Webb said. “I still marvel at what an absolutely stunning piece of writing it is.”\nRELATED:\n• The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Blonde on Blonde\n‘Tangled Up in Blue’\nImage Credit: Alvan Meyerowitz/Michael Ochs Archive/Getty\nBlood On the Tracks, 1975\n“ took me 10 years to live, and two years to write,” Dylan often said before playing “Tangled Up in Blue” in concert. His marriage was crumbling in 1974 as he wrote what would become the opener on Blood on the Tracks and his most personal examination of hurt and nostalgia. Dylan’s lyrical shifts in perspective, between confession and critique, and his acute references to the Sixties experience evoked a decade of both utopian and broken promise. His plaintive vocal and the fresh-air picking of the Minneapolis session players, organized by his brother, David Zimmerman, hearkened to an earlier pathos: the frank heartbreak and spiritual restoration in Appalachian balladry. Dylan has played this song many different ways live but rarely strays from the perfect crossroads of this recording, where emotional truths meet the everlasting comfort of the American folk song.\nRELATED:\n• The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Blood on the Tracks\n‘A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall’\nImage Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n‘Like a Rolling Stone’\nImage Credit: Photograph by Jerry Schatzberg/TrunkArchive.com\nBob Dylan\nMusic\nMusic Lists\nMore News\nMarcus King Goes Full Soul Man on New Song 'F-ck My Life Up Again'\nSoul Pivot\nBy\nDavid Browne\nCage the Elephant Lose Control on New Single 'Neon Pill'\nComeback\nBy\nLarisha Paul\nDolly Parton Celebrates Birthday by Gifting 9 New 'Rockstar' Songs\n🎂🎂🎂\nBy\nDaniel Kreps\nModern English Tease Forthcoming Album With Political Single 'Not My Leader'\nTaking a Stand\nBy\nEmily Zemler\nWatch Green Day Busk in the New York City Subway on 'Fallon'\nLate-Night TV\nBy\nEmily Zemler\nRead more\nThe Latest\nHunter Biden Associate Says GOP Misrepresented His Closed-Door Testimony\nCherry Picking\n10:11 AM\nMarcus King Goes Full Soul Man on New Song 'F-ck My Life Up Again'\nSoul Pivot\n9:56 AM\nCage the Elephant Lose Control on New Single 'Neon Pill'\nComeback\n9:51 AM\nDolly Parton Celebrates Birthday by Gifting 9 New 'Rockstar' Songs\n🎂🎂🎂\n9:41 AM\nThe digital daily newsletter\nA Cultural Force ThatTranscends Generations\nEnter your Email\nSubscribe\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\nWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.\nGo to PMC.com\nMost Popular\nFinal Oscar Predictions: 'Oppenheimer' Projected to Receive Most Nominations With 13, Netflix to Lead for All Studios With 21\nCriticism of 2023 Emmys \"Red\" Carpet Continues Following Chrissy Teigen's Comments\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With ‘Millions’ in Art Inside\nYou might also like\nPrince Harry Withdraws Libel Claim Against Mail on Sunday Publisher\n4 hours ago\nValentine’s Day Collections to Know: Details on the Fashion and Beauty Brands Giving Products a Touch ofLove\n5 hours ago\nThe Best Treadmills Under $500, According to Personal Trainers\n2 days ago\nSundance 2024 Kicks Off Its 40th Anniversary with a ‘Freaky’ and Full First Day\n3 hours ago\nAction Network CEO Patrick Keane DepartingCompany\n4 hours ago\nRolling Stone\nMusic\nPolitics\nTV & Movies\n(Sub)Culture\nStaff\nContact\nAdvertise\nShop\nLegal\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nAdChoices\nPMC Entertainment\nCalifornia Privacy Rights\nYour Privacy Choices\nEU Privacy Preferences\nAccessibility\nFollow Us\nfacebook\ntwitter\nyoutube\ninstagram\ntiktok\ntwitch\nmastodon\nNewsletter Signup\nDismiss\nLog-In\nPlease log in\nYou are no longer onsite at your organization.
