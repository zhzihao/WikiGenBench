Members debuting in winning group of 'The Origin' survival show revealed\nBy\nLopa K\nUpdated On :\n00:32 PST, May 9, 2022\nFOLLOW\nIST Entertainment‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Origin - A, B, Or What?‚Äô has finally come to an end after an exciting run. Home to K-pop groups like The Boyz, Victon and Apink, the label announced that their next group would be formed through a K-pop survival show with 13 participants. The show was already pretty star-studded as they brought in huge idols to mentor and judge the show. We had the likes of Minzy of 2NE1 fame, GOT7‚Äôs Jay B and even Infinite‚Äôs Sunggyu. Minzy herself had participated in the survival show ‚ÄòDouble Trouble‚Äô and had judged on ‚ÄòExtreme Debut: Wild Idol‚Äô with Sunggyu before.K-pop survival shows are one of the surest ways to form an idol group since the invested viewers in turn become fans who then root for the winners. We recently had groups like Kep1er from ‚ÄòGirls Planet 999‚Äô, TAN from ‚ÄòExtreme Debut: Wild Idol‚Äô and CLASS:y from ‚ÄòMy Teenage Girl‚Äô that were turning heads in their pre-debut era. Well, on May 7, ‚ÄòThe Origin‚Äô aired their finale in which there were seven winners who will be debuting in the K-pop group AB√ò which is short for ‚ÄòAt the Beginning of Originality‚Äô.READ MORE'The Origin': List of idols in survival show include GOT7 Jay B, Infinite Sunggyu, MinzyMBC ‚ÄòExtreme Debut: Wild Idol‚Äô: Here are the members of winning debut group TAN\nit kinda weird for me me if the debut group name is really abo.... the origin sounds better actually\n‚Äî Ï±ÑÏù¥ (@14now03) May 5, 2022\neven if their group name has a different meaning, let's not dismiss the fact that it shouldn't be a kpop name and ist should have thought abt it carefully... that's why a/b/o has a slash and ABO blood system comes together to distinguish the differences from the offensive word.\n‚Äî ‚ô™ (@baehjun) May 5, 2022\nist is a large company yet its staff clearly did not do enough research, or simply did not care, about the way this could effect indigenous australian people. if they use this slur as a name, every day they will be profiting off of indigenous australian people\n‚Äî rest (@junseokpics) May 5, 2022\nWho is AB√ò?
