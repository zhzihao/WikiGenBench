GOLDMAN March 21, 1986 12 AM PT FacebookTwitterShow more sharing optionsShareClose extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy Link URLCopied!Print Times Staff Writer NEW YORK— After 15 years of bitterness and debate, the New York City Council passed a gay rights bill Thursday.Cardinal John J. O’Connor promptly denounced the council’s decision and pledged to try to determine through legal action if its effects could be reversed.Cheers sounded in the City Council’s chamber and among supporters outside City Hall, many of whom had kept an all-night vigil, when the measure was adopted by a 21-14 vote. As word of the adoption spread, hundreds of cheering gays poured into the streets of Greenwich Village. Advertisement The bill, which goes to Mayor Edward I. Koch for his signature, bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in housing, employment and public accommodations. Violations carry a maximum penalty of $500 and a year in jail.Even though New York has the nation’s largest homosexual population, it was the 51st city in the nation to pass anti-sexual discrimination legislation, said Ron Najman, an official of the National Gay Task Force.“Their conscience must have told them they were doing the right thing,” said Councilman Sam Horowitz as the votes were counted. “I feel great. It was a hard fight.”Councilman Stephen Dibrienza said that he voted for the measure in memory of a friend who was an AIDS victim.Immediately after the City Council’s decision, Cardinal O’Connor, issued a statement.“We know many New Yorkers share our feelings of deep regret over the passage,” he said. “We will seek legal counsel to determine what steps may be taken to reverse this action of the City Council.”The bill’s origins can be traced to a 1969 police raid on the Stonewall, a gay bar. The raid set off violent street demonstrations and helped strengthen New York’s gay rights movement. Two years later, a gay rights bill was proposed, but it was largely ignored. Last week, for the first time since 1974, when it was defeated in the full council by a 22-19 vote, a committee cleared the measure. Advertisement Koch, who has announced that he will sign the bill, said Thursday “for a brief period of time (after it has been law), the opponents will realize that their fears were unwarranted”Councilman Noach Dear, who represents an Orthodox Jewish section of the city and voted against the measure, called its passage “a catastrophe for our beloved city. We are in the initial stages of an insidious crusade, but we had all better recognize it for what it is.”Koch said the measure “isn’t going to change life styles, isn’t going to change the city.”“It is simply civil rights legislation . . . giving people protection so that your personal sexual life, whether you’re heterosexual or homosexual, will no longer be a factor in your getting a job or renting an apartment or going to a restaurant or a theater or any public place of accommodation.”Andrew Humm, head of the Coalition of Gay and Lesbian Rights, said, “I think it’s a victory for the city. This is a bill that benefits everybody. It lets gays be gay and straight people be straight people.“I hope the more strident opponents of the bill . . . will give this bill a chance.” World & Nation Newsletter Start your day right Sign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

The first gay rights bill was introduced in the City Council in 1971 during the Lindsay Administration and assigned to the City Council’s General Welfare Committee. And there it lingered, rejected by committee members on four occasions. The New York City bill was simple—it amended the law that created the Commission on Human Rights by adding the words “sexual orientation” alongside the existing covered groups: race, creed, color, national origin or sex. It would have banned discrimination in housing, employment, places of public accommodation, resort or amusement and commercial space based on a person’s sexual orientation. The Commission on Human Rights subject files in the collection of Mayor John Lindsay include a folder of documents received and sent by City officials. Correspondence in 1971 between members of The Mattachine Society and the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and City officials show the organizations were pushing the Mayor to both “actively and personally” support the gay rights bill and to issue an executive order ending discrimination against homosexuals in the City’s hiring practices. The GAA further threatened to activate gay liberation organizations across the country to “harass and demonstrate against Lindsay as he campaigns to secure the Democratic Party nomination.”\nGay Activists Alliance Press Release, November 20, 1971. Mayor John V. Lindsay Subject Files. NYC Municipal Archives.\nThis, despite the Mayor’s earlier support in a letter to the sponsors of the gay rights bill commending them for their leadership in raising the issue and stating that it was appropriate for the City to “broaden its safeguards for citizens against all forms of arbitrary victimization.” The letter concluded by noting the Commission on Human Rights willingness to “lend assistance to passage of this useful legislation.”In December 1971, Marvin Schick an assistant to the Mayor who, along with Ronnie Eldridge, was the point person on gay rights, testified on behalf of the administration in support of the gay rights bill. “We in the Administration believe that New York owes those of our citizens who happen to be homosexual no less than it owes the many others who have come to this city seeking tolerance, fairness and personal freedom. Our city should now take this logical step: to provide the protection of the law against the many abuses which homosexuals still encounter constantly.”In January 1972, the GAA again pressed the administration to prohibit discrimination against gays in City municipal employment and expressed anger with the lack of progress. “We are appalled by the lip service the Mayor has given the issue” and threatened to hold him personally responsible if the gay rights bill failed. The pressure worked. In February, the Department of Personnel issued a policy bulletin that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in hiring and promoting within the municipal workforce. But, as the Association of the Bar of the City of New York noted in a committee report urging passage of the civil rights bill, the executive order “does not, of course, reach private employers.”\nLater in a 1972 statement to the media, Mayor Lindsay expressed disappointment when the Council committee didn’t advance the bill. The action “further postpones the time when a person whose sexual preference may differ from the majority’s can seek equal justice from the City Commission on Human Rights if he or she has been discriminated against in obtaining or keeping a job or in obtaining or securing housing accommodations.” And that was that from the Lindsay administration.By 1974, several municipalities and states had adopted gay civil rights laws, including Columbus, Minneapolis, Boulder, San Francisco, Berkeley, Seattle, Detroit, Ann Arbor, East Lansing, Washington and Toronto. One would think that New York City, home to the nation’s largest LGBTQ population would have been in the forefront. But, no. In 1974, during the Beame administration, the gay rights bill finally was passed out of committee with seven of the eight members present supporting it, although some committee members did not show up to vote. In order to move the bill out of the committee an amendment clarifying that the definition of sexual orientation should not “be construed to bear upon the standards of attire or dress code.” Basically, excluding transgender people. Twenty of the Council’s 43 members co-sponsored the bill, meaning that only two additional council members were needed to vote in support for the bill to become law. Luminaries such as Eleanor Holmes Norton the head of the Commission on Human Rights, and then-candidate for Manhattan District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau testified in favor of the legislation. Former Mayor Wagner sent a statement of support and Mayor Abe Beame announced he would sign the civil rights bill into law. A done deal, right? Wrong. The opposition was lining up. The Uniformed Fire Officers Association led the charge, spending $10,000 ($52,000 in today’s dollars) in ads against the bill. The New York Times quotes a member of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association executive committee explaining the organization’s view “All members of the team have to be a man’s man.” The Daily News reported that Orthodox rabbis were denouncing the legislation. The New York Catholic Archdiocese mobilized against the bill and editorialized in the weekly paper distributed in parishes throughout the area that the bill was “a menace to family life.” In a front page editorial against the bill the editors claimed it would “Damage the true civil rights cause in this city and will endanger the freedom of every citizen to protect his family from a serious immoral influence.”\nTagged: Gay rights, Gay Liberation, Gay Pride\nNewer PostInspiring Women – The Women’s Activism Story – Writing ContestOlder PostHappy Independence Day\nSocial Media\nBlog - For The Record RSS\nBlog archives\nJanuary 2024\nJan 12, 2024\nStables and Auction Marts - Building Plans with Horses\nJan 5, 2024\nRadio Row and the Fight for Lower Manhattan\nDecember 2023\nDec 22, 2023\nHappy Holidays\nDec 15, 2023\nThe Playboy Plot\nDec 8, 2023\nDrives, Rides, and Walks—Horses in Central Park\nDec 1, 2023\nRemembering Rosalynn Carter\nNovember 2023\nNov 21, 2023\nHappy Thanksgiving\nNov 17, 2023\nThe National Museum of the American Indian\nNov 9, 2023\nA Spanish-American War Mystery\nNov 3, 2023\nUniting the Boroughs: The Triborough Bridge\nOctober 2023\nOct 27, 2023\nPreserving the Ghosts of New York City\nOct 20, 2023\nHorsepower: The City and the Horse\nOct 13, 2023\nMarriage Contracts\nOct 6, 2023\nThe Closing of Sydenham Hospital\nSeptember 2023\nSep 29, 2023\nThe Entire Expense Should Be Borne by the Federal Government: A 1913 Report from the Commissioners of Accounts\nSep 22, 2023\nThe United Nations in New York City\nSep 15, 2023\nLoew’s Canal Street Theater\nSep 8, 2023\nCommunity Gardens\nSep 1, 2023\nThe First Labor Day, September 5, 1882\nAugust 2023\nAug 25, 2023\nWomen’s Equality Day 2023: Embrace Equity\nAug 18, 2023\nThe Aerial Views of Robert Moses\nAug 11, 2023\nPerseverence: Gertrude Ederle Swims the English Channel\nAug 4, 2023\nWhat We're Working on Now: Indexing Felony Indictment Files\nJuly 2023\nJul 28, 2023\nMop Shaking\nJul 21, 2023\nFind of the Week, Part 2\nJul 14, 2023\nCity of Water Day\nJul 7, 2023\nNew York City Receptions\nJune 2023\nJun 30, 2023\nThe Battle for Gay Rights, continued\nJun 23, 2023\nThe Battle for Gay Rights\nJun 16, 2023\nThe 2022 ARB Report\nJun 9, 2023\nNYC Undercover\nJun 2, 2023\nThe City Cemetery on Hart Island\nMay 2023\nMay 26, 2023\nSoldiers and Sailors Monument\nMay 19, 2023\nSilent Toasts and Solo Flights: Mayor LaGuardia’s Forgotten Fraternity\nMay 12, 2023\nFind of the Week: Report of the Jamaica Bay Improvement Commission\nMay 5, 2023\nThe Congressional Records of Mayor Edward I.
