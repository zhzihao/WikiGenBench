Championship, League One and League Two semi-final and final datesAll the important dates and information ahead of the English Football League's blue riband event that sees Wembley Stadium host three finals - this year with the added bonus of full capacities for the first time since 2019Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soon8CancelPlay nowChampionship fixtures: Day one, boxing day and final dayByRicky CharlesworthEFL writer14:52, 19 Apr 2022|commentsThe English Football League is heading towards its customary entertaining finish. Across the Championship, League One and League Two there is still plenty to be decided at both ends of the table in all three divisions. Arguably, the play-offs are the highlight of the EFL's calendar. It is their showpiece event that sees Wembley filled out with fans of six sides, all aiming for a spectacular finish to the season. Sadly, the last two years have seen games either played in front of an empty national stadium or with heavily-reduced crowds in attendance. This year it is back to normal as full capacity crowds are once again permitted. Here, we look at the all-important dates for the 2022 play-offs.\nSize of League One promotion task laid bare to Derby County and Wayne Rooney\nWayne Rooney's four-point plan to guide Derby to League One success after X-rated speech\nWhen and where are the play-offs? This year sees the three showpiece finals staggered across two weekends at Wembley Stadium.\nWembley Stadium is once again the setting for this year's EFL play-off finals\nWhich three sides will win this year's play-offs? Let us know in the comments CHAMPIONSHIP Semi-final first legs Friday May 13, 7.45pm - 6th vs 3rd Saturday May 14, 3pm - 5th vs 4th Second legs Monday May 16, 7.45pm - 3rd vs 6th Tuesday May 17, 7.45pm - 4th vs 5th Final Sunday, May 29 - 3pm LEAGUE ONE Semi-final first legs Thursday May 5, 7.45pm - 6th vs 3rd Friday May 6, 7.45pm - 5th vs 4th Second legs Sunday May 8, 6.30pm - 3rd vs 6th Monday May 9, 7.45pm - 4th vs 5th Final Saturday, May 21 - 3pm LEAGUE TWO Semi-final first legs Saturday May 14, 7.45pm - 7th vs 4th Sunday May 15, 12pm - 6th vs 5th Second legs Wednesday May 18, 7.45pm - 4th vs 7th Thursday May 19, 7.45pm - 5th vs 6th Final Saturday, May 28 - 3pm How can I watch them? Sky Sports will be televising every single game, including semi-finals in all three divisions. Highlights of the finals will be on Quest. Are tickets on sale? Tickets normally do not go on sale until some time in May. The EFL will be publishing more on this closer to that time. Last year saw all three finals hosted with a capacity limit of just under 12,000. All three games took place on successive days. Brentford beat Swansea in the Championship final on the Saturday, with Blackpool overcoming Lincoln on the Sunday to win the League One final. Morecambe beat Newport in the League Two final on Bank Holiday Monday.\nBrentford won the 2021 Championship play-off final at Wembley\nPrior to those matches, EFL chief executive Trevor Birch spoke about how the play-offs remain the organisation's premier showpiece. He said: \"You can see the amount of work that has got into it from the staff, who work incredibly hard. The Play-Offs are the pinnacle of our season, so I’m really looking forward to it. “This is the 35th season of the Play-Offs, so they’ve assumed a really important role. It’s a great format and it creates great excitement. From half-way into the season, everyone you speak to is talking about hopes of the Play-Offs, which keep the season alive. There’s a global audience for the Play-Offs, a household reach of almost 500 million, which is incredible. The Play-Offs are a great advert for the league.” Read More\nJack Colback makes tongue-in-cheek admission after goal of season contender\nRead More\nWayne Rooney backed to win prestigious manager award despite Derby's relegation\nMost Read Don't Miss FollowMirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ONNewport CorporationFootball League ChampionshipFootball League TwoFootball League OneWembley StadiumSky SportsTrevor BirchEngland football teamThe Football LeagueChampionship play-offsDon't miss out on any Football League action with our EFL72 email update!Sign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.
