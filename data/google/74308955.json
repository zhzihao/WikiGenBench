Combining the observed flood extent and depth data from ICEYE satellites with auxiliary data sources, we are working on a new data release with several new AOIs (areas of interest) and are updating some previous AOIs from our first release.\nIn the image above, you can see new and repeated AOIs combined.

Vermont’s capital, Montpelier, is under several feet of water from flooding on the Winooski River. The river levels in Rutland, Montpelier, and Johnson, VT have exceeded their peak. The crest is now progressing downstream towards Johnsonville and Burlington, VT, which is anticipated to peak before the day's end Eastern Time. On the eastern side of the state, the Connecticut River is already experiencing minor flooding as far down as northern CT. The forecasts predict a single crest moving downstream, expected to reach Massachusetts on Wednesday and Connecticut on Thursday. We have scheduled SAR imagery acquisitions along this river through the entire duration of the event.No substantial rainfall is expected until at least midday Thursday, but the possibility of rain increases as we move into the weekend, with forecasts indicating the likelihood of 1-2 inches of rain, and up to 3 inches in local areas. Given the recent weather patterns of rain and flooding, combined with other incidents from the past few weeks, there is an increased risk of further flooding.\nICEYE FLood ANALYSIS: RELEASE 1 HAS BEEN DELIVERED\nJuly 11, 2023\nThe first release of the Flood Insights product was delivered to our customers on July 11, 2023 by 23:00 UTC.\nThe above image shows the AOIs (areas of interest) covered in our first analysis release.

Published On 11 Jul 202311 Jul 2023facebooktwitterwhatsappcopylinkA storm that left up to two months’ worth of rain in Vermont and saturated other parts of the United States’ Northeast was moving out Tuesday, but more flooding was expected after already cutting off access to some communities, including the main approach to Vermont’s state capital.\nThere have been no reports of injuries or deaths related tothe Vermont flooding, according to emergency officials. But dozens of roads were closed, including many along the spine of the Green Mountains. And the National Weather Service issued flash flood warnings and advisories for much of the state from the Massachusetts line north to the Canadian border.\nThe slow-moving storm reached New England after hitting parts of Connecticut and New York, where one person died as she was trying to leave her home during flash flooding, on Sunday.\nPresident Joe Biden, who is in Vilnius, Lithuania, attending the annual NATO summit, declared an emergency in Vermont and authorised the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance.\nFlooding affected Montpelier, the Vermont state capital. Interstate 89, a major highway, was closed in both directions between Montpelier and Middlesex, north of Montpelier.\nMontpelier Town Manager Bill Fraser warned that the Wrightsville Dam several miles to the north on the North Branch of the Winooski River could exceed capacity. That has never happened before.\n“There would be a large amount of water coming into Montpelier, which would drastically add to the existing flood damage,” he said, adding that there are very few evacuation options remaining.\n“People in at-risk areas may wish to go to upper floors in their houses.”\nThe city has asked for swift water rescue crews to be moved into the area to assist when possible. Crews from North Carolina, Michigan and Connecticut were among those helping to get to Vermont towns on Monday that had been unreachable since torrents of rain began belting the state.\nMike Cannon, a coordinator with Vermont’s Urban Search and Rescue programme, told reporters on Tuesday that 117 rescues had been made since the extreme weather struck. A further 67 people and 17 animals had been evacuated.\nPeople in New York and Connecticut were cleaning up from earlier rain. The National Weather Service in Burlington said rain in the northern part of Vermont was expected to lessen Tuesday, but more rain was in the forecast for Thursday.\nOne of the worst-hit places was New York’s Hudson Valley, where a woman identified by police as Pamela Nugent, 43, died as she tried to escape her flooded home with her dog in the hamlet of Fort Montgomery.\nA damaged car lays on a collapsed roadway along Route 32 in the Hudson Valley near Cornwall, New York.
