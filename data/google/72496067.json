        "text": "Why was Peru President Pedro Castillo impeached? | Explainer News | Al Jazeera\nWhy was Castillo in conflict with Congress?\nThe government of Castillo, a former rural school teacher, suffered from political instability for months. He and members of his family are facing six corruption investigations. He has denied any wrongdoing.\nCastillo previously survived two impeachment attempts, the first of which came last December. At the time, a relatively small group of opposition lawmakers cited an investigation by prosecutors into illicit financing of the governing party. To remove the president requires two-thirds of the 130 lawmakers to vote in favour. Only 46 voted in favour.\nCongress tried to impeach Castillo again in March for “permanent moral incapacity”, a term incorporated into Peruvian constitutional law that experts say lacks an objective definition and that Congress has used more than half a dozen times since 2017 to try to remove presidents. The effort failed, this time with only 55 votes in favour.\nIn October, five of Castillo’s allies were detained on corruption charges. In August, his sister-in-law, Yenifer Paredes, was given 30 months of pre-trial detention. Prosecutors alleged that Paredes was involved in a scheme to hand contracts to allies of the president in his home region. She has not been charged with a crime.\nIn November,Castillo accepted the resignation of then-prime minister and strong ally, Anibal Torres, marking the departure of the fourth prime minister in Castillo’s term.\nTorres had challenged Congress to hold a confidence vote and stepped down after the legislative body declined to do so.\nCastillo ran on a left-wing platform that promised a fairer economic system, but he has largely governed as a moderate.\nIn November, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Peru’s capital to call for the resignation of Castillo.\nCastillo has previously said he was the victim of a campaign to remove him from power.\nA man lights a firework as people hold up Peru’s flags, after Congress approved the removal of President Pedro Castillo, in Lima, Peru, December 7, 2022\nWhy was Castillo arrested?\nAfter the impeachment vote, Castillo was arrested as he was travelling to the Mexican embassy to request asylum, according to a police report published by the local press.\nVideos circulating on social media appeared to show police intercepting his car to take him into custody.\nThe Public Ministry said on Wednesday that Castillo had been arrested on charges of the crimes of “rebellion” and “conspiracy” for breaking the constitutional order.\nCastillo was transferred to a police facility in eastern Lima where corruption-convicted former President Alberto Fujimori, who was removed by Congress in 2000, is serving out his sentence.\nHundreds of people protested following the impeachment, some of whom supported the former president, while others celebrated the removal.\nSupporters of former President Pedro Castillo confront riot police surrounding the police station where Castillo arrived earlier, in Lima, Peru, Wednesday, December 7, 2022\nWho is the new president?\nFollowing the impeachment, Boluarte, 60, was sworn in as the new president. She is a lawyer by training and Peru’s first female president.\n“I request a political truce to install a government of national unity,” she said in her first speech as Peru’s sixth president in just five years.\n“I ask for time, valuable time to rescue the country from corruption and misrule,” she said, adding thata new cabinet will be inclusive of all political sides.\nBoluarte criticised Castillo’s move to dissolve Congress as an “attempted coup”.\nShe had distanced herself from Castillo in recent weeks and resigned from her role as a cabinet minister.\nBoluarte has proven to be someone who “goes with the flow”, said analyst Andres Calderon, noting how she quickly distanced herself from her socialist party’s polarising Marxist founder Vladimir Cerron.\nFormer Vice President Dina Boluarte receives the presidential sash as she is sworn in as the new president at Congress in Lima, Peru, December 7, 2022\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agenciesaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network"

GUADALUPE PARDO / AP Peru's leftist president Pedro Castillo was ousted by lawmakers and arrested Wednesday, December 7, in a dizzying series of events in a country long prone to political upheaval. Dina Boluarte, a 60-year-old lawyer, was sworn in as Peru's first female president just hours after Mr. Castillo tried to dissolve Congress in a move criticized as an attempted coup. The day of high drama began with Mr. Castillo facing his third impeachment attempt since the former rural school teacher unexpectedly won power from Peru's traditional political elite in an election 18 months ago. In a televised address to the nation, the 53-year-old announced that he was dissolving the opposition-dominated Congress, installing a curfew and would rule by decree. As criticism poured in over the address, lawmakers defiantly gathered earlier than planned to debate the impeachment motion and approved it, with 101 votes out of a total of 130 lawmakers. Read more Latin America's left takes on the challenges of ruling Mr. Castillo was impeached for his \"moral incapacity\" to exercise power, after a litany of crises including six investigations against him, five cabinet reshuffles and large protests. The constitution allows impeachment proceedings to be brought against a president based on alleged political rather than legal wrongdoing – making impeachments commonplace in Peru. Mr. Castillo was arrested on Wednesday evening, said Marita Barreto, coordinator of a team of prosecutors who deal with government corruption. A source in the attorney general's office told Agence France-Presse he was being investigated for rebellion. Mr. Castillo became the third president since 2018 to be sacked under the \"moral incapacity\" provision in the constitution. In this photo provided by Peru's police administration office, former president Pedro Castillo, second from left, and former prime minister Anibal Torres, far left, sit as prosecutor Marco Huaman stands at the center inside a police station, where Mr. Castillo and Mr. Torres' status was not immediately clear. In Lima, Peru, on December 7, 2022. AP Within two hours, Ms. Boluarte took the oath of office in front of Congress to serve out the rest of Mr. Castillo's term, until July 2026. Peru is no stranger to political instability: It had three different presidents in five days in 2020 and is now on its sixth president since 2016. Political outsider After the impeachment vote, Mr. Castillo left the presidential palace with a bodyguard, heading to the Lima police headquarters before his arrest was officially announced. His supporters criticized their leader's ousting. \"I want to denounce the fact that our president has been kidnapped by the national police, that he has been detained with premeditation and treachery by Congress,\" said retired soldier Manuel Gaviria, 59, Mr. Castillo came out of seemingly nowhere to win 50.12% of votes in a June 2021 runoff election against right-wing Keiko Fujimori, the corruption-charged daughter of graft-convicted ex-president Alberto Fujimori. He was born in a small village where he worked as a teacher for 24 years, and was largely unknown until he led a national strike in 2017 that forced the then-government to agree to pay rise demands. Mr. Castillo sought to portray himself as a humble servant of the people, traveling on horseback for much of his presidential campaign and promising to end to corruption. However, allegations against him quickly flooded in. The investigations he is facing range from alleged graft and obstruction of justice to plagiarizing his university thesis. In October, Peru's attorney general also filed a constitutional complaint accusing Mr. Castillo of heading a criminal organization involving his family and allies. Read more Peru attorney general files corruption complaint against President Pedro Castillo Mr. Castillo and his lawyers long argued the investigations against him were part of a plot to unseat him. \"This intolerable situation cannot continue,\" he said earlier Wednesday as he announced he planned to convene a new Congress to draft a new constitution within nine months. 'Now former president' Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Congress ahead of the vote. \"We are tired of this corrupt government that was stealing from day one,\" said 51-year-old Johana Salazar. Supporters of former president Pedro Castillo confront riot police surrounding the police station where Mr. Castillo arrived earlier, in Lima, Peru, on December 7, 2022. MARTIN MEJIA / AP Ricardo Palomino, a 50-year-old systems engineer, said Mr. Castillo's attempt to dissolve parliament was \"totally unacceptable and unconstitutional.

He also called for new legislative elections. The move, widely condemned as an attempted autogolpe (Spanish for “self-coup”), prompted a slew of resignations from cabinet members and top government officials. Peru’s military and police forces called his actions unconstitutional and refused to support them. After attempting to seek asylum at the Mexican embassy in Peru’s capital, Lima, Castillo was arrested on charges of conspiracy and rebellion before lawmakers successfully impeached him. He could face up to twenty years in jail.\nMore From Our Experts\nWill Freeman\nTough New Immigration Rules Risk Empowering the Cartels\nJoshua Kurlantzick\nTaiwan's Presidential Election Elicits Strong Response in Indo-Pacific\nElliott Abrams\nWhat to Do About Coups\nPeru\nLatin America\nDemocracy\nDemonstrations and Protests\nAfter taking office, Castillo faced accusations of corruption and opposition from the majority of lawmakers over his radical proposals. His Free Peru party, while the biggest single faction in Congress, holds only 37 of 130 total seats. This political fragmentation has made it difficult to pass legislation, and it led to the two previous failed impeachment attempts.\nFor many observers, Castillo’s latest actions are reminiscent of a long history of conflict between legislatures and presidents, both in Peru and across Latin America. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, for instance, ruled as a dictator for nearly a decade after his 1992 autogolpe, which had the military’s support. Fujimori and several other former Peruvian presidents have likewise faced investigations or imprisonment for alleged corruption.\nMore From Our Experts\nWill Freeman\nTough New Immigration Rules Risk Empowering the Cartels\nJoshua Kurlantzick\nTaiwan's Presidential Election Elicits Strong Response in Indo-Pacific\nElliott Abrams\nWhat to Do About Coups\nClose\nThis work is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) License.\nView License Detail\nClose\nExplore More on Peru\nPeru\nTrump's No-Show May Lift Summit From Swamp\nPresident Trump's no-show means less drama and more space at Summit of the Americas for the main theme of corruption.\nBlog Post\nby Shannon K.

But with a hostile opposition, numerous legal issues and protests demanding for his removal, it is far from certain that he will see his five-year presidential term to completion in 2026.\nFor his part, the president appears determined to hold on. In response to November’s protests, Castillo said, “They will have me until the last day of my term because my people have decided so.”\nSource: Al Jazeera, Reutersaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network"

The opposition currently has 80 of the 130 parliamentary seats, and would have to convince some of the ruling party lawmakers or their allies to vote along with them to succeed.In March, Castillo avoided impeachment after a debate that lasted more than eight hours, with only 55 legislators voting in favor.However, he has remained under fire, recently appointing his fifth prime minister and cabinet since his July 2021 election, while thousands took to the streets in November to demand his removal from office.Castillo is also under investigation in six corruption cases, including accusations against his family and political entourage.The president will have 60 minutes to defend himself in front of Congress.\"They intend to blow up democracy and disregard the people's right to choose... to the power that the people took from them at the polls,\" Castillo said Tuesday. \"I have never stolen from my country, I am not corrupt,\" he said.'No room for a truce'If he is impeached, he will be replaced by his vice president, Dina Boluarte, although if she resigns, the head of Congress Jose Williams will step into the top job.Castillo, 53, has been locked in a power struggle with Congress since the attorney general filed a complaint accusing Castillo of heading a criminal organization involving his family and allies that hands out public contracts in exchange for money.While serving his five-year term that ends in 2026 Castillo cannot be criminally tried and prosecutors have called for him to be \"suspended,\" a move which Congress is evaluating, but which has no precedent.In October, Castillo requested mediation by the Organization of American States (OAS), saying the attempts to remove him were \"a coup in progress.\" The body visited the country in November and called for a \"100 day political truce,\" which fell on deaf ears.\"There is no room for a truce, nobody wants to talk with a president like Pedro Castillo, who does not project confidence,\" political analyst Augusto Alvarez told AFP.Impeachment proceedings are relatively common in Peru because its constitution allows for one to be brought against a president based on the more subjective premise of political rather than legal wrongdoing.It has created much political instability: In November 2020, Peru had three presidents within one week.The OAS's human rights commission last year raised concerns about the \"moral incapacity\" constitutional provision, saying it had been distorted due to \"a lack of objective definition.\"\n© 2022 AFP\nHappening now\nwar\nRussia\nUkraine\nFrance\nFeatures\nServices\nNewsletters\nWatch France24 on TV\nRSS feeds\nApplication\nDownload France24 app\nFrance Médias Monde\nLegal notice\nPrivacy\nCookies\nManage news alerts\nFacebook\nX\nInstagram\nYouTube\nTikTok\nTelegram\nSoundCloud\n© 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

He was then detained and accused of rebellion.Reports in local media say he was heading to the Mexican embassy in the capital when he was arrested.Ms Boluarte, a 60-year-old lawyer, said she would govern until July 2026, which is when Mr Castillo's presidency would have ended. Speaking after taking the oath of office, she called for a political truce to overcome the crisis which has gripped the country.\"What I ask for is a space, a time to rescue the country,\" she said.Pedro Castillo: The primary school teacher who became Peru's presidentWednesday's dramatic chain of events began with President Pedro Castillo giving an address on national television in which he declared a state of emergency.He announced that he would dissolve the opposition-controlled Congress, a move which was met with shock both in Peru - several ministers resigned in protest - and abroad.Watch: Three dramatic moments from the day Peru's president was oustedThe head of the constitutional court accused him of launching a coup d'etat, while the US \"strongly urged\" Mr Castillo to reverse his decision.Peru's police and armed forces released a joint statement in which they said they respected the constitutional order. Mr Castillo tried to dissolve Congress just hours before it was due to start fresh impeachment proceedings against him - the third since he came to office in July 2021. In his televised address he said: \"In response to citizens' demands throughout the length and breadth of the country, we have decided to establish an exceptional government aimed at re-establishing the rule of law and democracy.\"He said that \"a new Congress with constituent powers to draw up a new constitution\" would be convened \"within no more than nine months\".But Congress, which is controlled by parties opposed to Mr Castillo, convened an emergency session and held the impeachment vote Mr Castillo had been trying to prevent. The result was overwhelming: 101 voted in favour of impeaching him, with only six against and 10 abstentions.

In the photos - which were shared by police on Twitter but subsequently deleted - he could be seen sitting, seemingly relaxed, and chatting to others. Footage was then released of Mr Castillo signing papers with prosecutors.He was later detained and accused of rebellion for breaking the constitutional order.Peru has been going through a rocky political period, with multiple presidents ousted from office in recent years. In 2020, it had three presidents within the space of five days.Mr Castillo, who is a left-wing former school teacher, was elected in June 2021 in a polarising election in which he defeated his right-wing rival Keiko Fujimori. He had recently been fighting allegations of corruption, which he said were part of a plot to oust him.PeruPedro CastilloRelatedHow Ecuador descended into gang violenceLatin America & CaribbeanThousands of young turtles saved from traffickingLatin America & CaribbeanUS drops bomb threat charges against Peruvian manUS & CanadaMorePeru recalls envoy over Mexico's 'unacceptable' remarksMexico's president described Dina Boluarte's government as \"unconstitutional\", sparking fury in Peru.Latin America & CaribbeanPeru's president calls for truce as protests flareDina Boluarte says ongoing unrest has caused $1.3bn (£1.56bn) in damages to infrastructure and output.Latin America & CaribbeanHistoric building catches fire amid Peru protestsAuthorities are yet to report how the building, in Lima's Plaza San Martín, caught fire.Latin America & CaribbeanPeru president not resigning despite violent protestsWeeks of violent anti-government protests have brought large parts of the country to a standstill.Latin America & CaribbeanPeru president faces genocide inquiry over clashesThe charges against Dina Boluarte and her key ministers come after weeks of deadly protests.Latin America & CaribbeanHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthVideoLiveBBC ShopBBC in other languagesTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices/ Do Not Sell My InfoCopyright 2024 BBC.
