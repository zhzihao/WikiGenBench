        "text": "The current leader of the TPN-PB, declared a “terrorist group” by Indonesia in 2021, is Egianus Kogoya, the youngest son of the group’s former leader Silas Kogoya.\nThe most recent surge in violence can be traced back to 2018 and a TPN-PB attack on a controversial highway project in which some 24 Indonesian construction workers were killed.\nThe armed group said the men – working on a road through the highlands to connect the coast with the interior – were spies for the government in Jakarta.\nAllegations of racism against Papuans have also heightened tensions.\nIn August 2019, dozens of Papuan students at a university in Surabaya, Indonesia’s second-largest city, were arrested by police after they were accused of desecrating the Indonesian flag.\nThe students said mobs had besieged them in their dormitories, calling them “monkeys”, igniting anger in Papua itself where more than a dozen people were killed in violent protests that prompted Indonesia to once again deploy more troops to the area.\nAmnesty International Indonesia says at least 179 civilians were killed in the fighting between 2018 and 2022, along with 44 Indonesian soldiers and police, and 23 fighters.\nPolitical initiatives have added to the deepening suspicion with Jokowi’s recent amendments to the 20-year-old Special Autonomy Law, which has further divided the region and are seen by independence-minded Papuans as an attempt to expand the central government’s role in Papua.\nWith little sign that diplomatic initiatives are having an effect internationally, younger fighters led by people like Kogoya, appear increasingly willing to take more radical steps to achieve their aims.\nSince the TPN-PB kidnapped Mehrtens, they have released a series of photos and videos of the New Zealander, showing him wearing “Free Papua” shirts and holding the Morning Star flag, surrounded by fighters armed with guns, bows and arrows.\n“West Papua is officially under martial law,” Wenda wrote on Facebook earlier this month.\n“This is what the new ‘combat alert’ announced by the Indonesian military last month means in practice. All of West Papuan life is governed by military checkpoints, arbitrary arrests, and daily humiliation and fear. We live our lives under the scope of a sniper rifle.”\nThe most recent video showed Philip Mehrtens surrounded by dozens of armed pro-independence fighters from the TPN-PB\nNearly four months after Mehrtens was kidnapped, New Zealand says it is aware of the latest videos and photos and is doing “all it can” to secure his release.\n“The welfare of Mr Mehrtens is our top priority,” a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade spokesperson said in an email to Al Jazeera.\nThe last major crisis involving foreign hostages was the Mapenduma Incident in 1996 when TPN-PB members – including Egianus Kogoya’s father – abducted a group of Indonesian and European environmental researchers.\nTalks continued for months with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, but after more than five months Indonesia opted for a military solution to free the hostages.\nTwo of the researchers – both Indonesians – were killed.\nAnalysts say that nearly 30 years later, there is little to indicate Indonesia has changed its approach.\n“They avoid the root causes,” Hipolitus Wangge, a researcher at the Australian National University who was in Nduga in 2019, told Al Jazeera. “The deployment of troops is so typical. In some ways, it’s desperate because they don’t have any other approach to addressing the causes of the conflict.”\nAmid a lack of trust between Indigenous communities and the authorities, Wangge sees little chance that Mehrtens’s situation will be resolved soon.\n“There’s no middle ground,” he said.\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network"

        "text": "TAPOL statement on the hostage-taking in Nduga, West Papua | Tapol\nSkip to main content\nid\nPromoting human rights, peace and democracy in Indonesia\nMain navigation\nAbout\nAbout TAPOL\nCarmel Budiarjo\nOur Work\nOur Work overview\nMilitarism\nFreedom of Expression & Association\nBusiness & Human Rights\nPolitical prisoners\nResource Centre\nNews\nPublications\nBriefings\nReports\nStatements\nContact\nDonate\nTAPOL statement on the hostage-taking in Nduga, West Papua\nTAPOL08 March 2023\nIt has been a month since Susi Air pilot Philip Mark Mehrtens was taken hostage by the National Liberation Army of West Papua (TPNPB) in Nduga, in the highlands of Papua Pegunungan Province. Despite putting the West Papua issue back in the international spotlight, the hostage-taking of civilians is regrettable and unjustified based on international human rights and humanitarian norms.The incident began after Mehrtens landed a Pilatus Porter PC-6 Susi Air plane at Paro Airport, Paro District, in Nduga Regency, to deliver five Papuans from Timika, 7th February 2023. Troops from the TPNPB’s War Area Command (Kodap) III Ndugama-Derakma ambushed them and released the passengers, setting the plane on fire and taking the pilot hostage.The TPNPB promised to release Mehrtens if the government met their main demands, which was recognising West Papua's independence. Otherwise, the TPNPB claimed to be recruiting Mehrtens to train their troops to fly planes.The government has set up a team composed of police and military for the hostage release operation. Local governments as well as members of churches and local community leaders were also deployed to establish communication with the armed group. But there was no resolution, especially because the TPNPB wanted United Nations mediation.Two weeks ago the government said it had located the hostages' whereabouts. However, the New Zealand Government called on Indonesia to exercise restraint and to continue to use persuasive methods and to negotiate with Mehrtens’ captors. New Zealand does not want the issue to become of international concern.Aside from the New Zealand Government's concerns, TAPOL supports the use of negotiation and persuasion as the most sensible path to resolve this situation. The government should not be led by those who wish to launch military operations to rescue Mehrtens, because the track record of similar military operations in the past has resulted in an increase in the number of civilian casualties who were not involved in armed conflict. Indonesia must be careful that the outcome of the 1996 Mapenduma hostage crisis that ended with the special forces storming the place where hostages were held, resulting in the deaths of two hostages and their captors, is not repeated. This incident shows that there is no place for reckless decisions that could put the lives of hostages at risk.Considering what has happened since the hostage-taking incident has begun, TAPOL states:The act of taking hostages cannot be justified through the lens of humanitarian law and international human rights law. Moreover, the pilot was a civilian and was not involved in the armed conflict between the TPNPB and Indonesian security forces.We hope that Mehrtens will be treated humanely while in captivity. He must not be subjected to any torture or ill-treatment. His mental and physical wellbeing must be guaranteed by his captors and basic provisions must be granted to him. Torture and ill-treatment are prohibited in any situation, whether during peacetime or in armed conflict situations, by international human rights and humanitarian law.The Indonesian government must continue to prioritise negotiations while involving competent, authoritative, and neutral international third parties.There should be no place for the involvement of the Indonesian National Military (TNI), the Indonesian National Police (Polri), let alone the Military’s Special Forces Command (Kopassus), in negotiations nor influencing decisions related to negotiations.We urge conflicting parties, in this case the TPNPB and the TNI/Polri, to adhere to the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution, in order to prevent civilians - both the pilot who is being held hostage and other civilians in the surrounding area - who are not involved in the armed conflict from becoming victims of unjustified actions including violence.The Government of Indonesia has a responsibility to guarantee and protect the human rights of civilians who must be relocated (Internally Displaced Persons / IDPs) due to security problems in Nduga. Apart from fulfilling these guarantees, it must also give serious consideration to admitting international agencies with experience in providing aid to IDPs.ENDSContact: info@tapol.org\nThemes\nIHL\nMilitarism\nTPNPB\nWest Papua\nCategories\nrefugees\nFooter menu\nContact us\nDonate\nPrivacy policy\nTAPOLDurham Resource Centre86 Durham Road, London, N7 7DTTel: +44 (0) 20 7561 7485Email: info@tapol.org"

Philip Mehrtens, 37, was taken hostage by West Papua National Liberation Army fighters (TPNPB) in February.The rebels have been holding him captive as a political prisoner in the remote Nduga region and this week attacked a number of Indonesian troops sent to rescue him, killing at least one.Mr Mehrtens' kidnapping is the latest flashpoint in a long-running, often brutally violent conflict between the Indonesian government and West Papua's indigenous people.What is West Papua?Indonesia is divided into 38 provinces across thousands of islands.West Papua is the easternmost territory. It is the western half of New Guinea, the world's second largest island after Greenland, with Papua New Guinea (PNG) comprising the eastern half. PNG was granted independence from Australia in 1975. West Papua has had a special autonomous status since 2001. Since June 2022, it has been divided into five provinces. The resource-rich area includes the world's largest gold mine, as well as extensive sources of natural gas, minerals, timber and palm oil. West Papua has a population of more than 5.4 million people. The indigenous Papuans, who are Melanesian, are now thought to be outnumbered by settlers from other parts of the archipelago. Indonesia is ethnically very diverse, with the Javanese at around 100 million the largest group.Why is there conflict in West Papua? When Indonesia's independence from the Netherlands was agreed in 1949, West Papua remained under Dutch control. However Indonesia launched an armed campaign to end Dutch rule there in 1961, and, with US support, was allowed to take control two years later. A UN-mandated vote was held to confirm Indonesian sovereignty in 1969. Known as the Act of Free Choice, it has been widely criticised as only 1,022 Papuan leaders, supervised by Indonesia, were permitted to vote. A pro-independence insurgency known as the Free Papua Movement (OPM) began an armed campaign shortly afterwards, which continues to this day. The Free Papua Movement is poorly armed and divided along clan and regional lines. The Indonesian authorities have shown little tolerance of this separatist movement, and have frequently used the military to fight it.Getty ImagesPapuan students protesting for the independence of Papua at a rally in Surabaya, Java in 2021Some analysts estimate up to 450,000 soldiers, insurgents and civilians have died in the conflict since it began in the 1960s.The Indonesian military has also been accused of serious human rights abuses going back to the 1960s. Last year, UN-appointed experts said recent abuses included child killings, disappearances, torture and enforced mass displacement.What is the current state of the conflict?Pro-independence fighters have been mounting more frequent attacks since 2018.The security situation in the highlands deteriorated after the military intelligence chief for West Papua was shot dead by separatists in 2021.The West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) - the armed wing of the Free Papua Movement - has said it carried out several of these attacks.It has long been labelled a terrorist organisation by the Indonesian government.In 1996, the TPNPB kidnapped 26 members of a World Wildlife Fund research mission in Mapenduma. Two Indonesians in the group were killed by their captors, but the remaining hostages were eventually freed within five months.More than a decade later, a convoy of 16 buses carrying gold mine employees was attacked. This resulted in two deaths and five people injured.In 2018, 25 Indonesian construction workers were abducted from their camp in Nduga by a Papuan armed group, with at least 17 of them being killed. Tens of thousands of people were displaced during the military operation that followed.This is the same area where Mr Mehrtens, the New Zealand pilot, was kidnapped. It is on the route of the controversial Trans-Papua Highway, a road being built across the mountains which many Papuan nationalists believe is a threat to their identity and traditional way of life.Why have separatists targeted Westerners?Following Mr Mehrtens' kidnapping, a TPNPB spokesman said that it would now target \"all foreigners: the US, EU, Australians and New Zealanders\".He claimed that those countries had supported Indonesia's rule by sending weapons and training soldiers over past decades. He said they had also turned a blind eye to Indonesia's oppression in the region.Human rights groups have also said those countries could speak up more about Indonesia's human rights abuses. Australia, for example, has long had close defence ties with Indonesia.Papuan grievances against Western governments also originate from those countries' roles in allowing the flawed 1969 referendum to go ahead and to be approved by the UN.
