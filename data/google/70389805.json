Six years on, her case is still unsolved.Missy Bevers via courtjunkie.com Missy was a 45-year-old mother of three from Red Oak, Texas. She took fitness very seriously and taught her own classes. She was an active member of the community and had no known enemies.Just after 4 am, Missy arrived at Midlothian’s Creekside Church of Christ to prepare for her early morning fitness class. She taught a gladiator boot camp and was prepping the room for a famously intensive session.Missy was found by her students at 5 am, who quickly called emergency services. She had a head injury and multiple puncture wounds to her chest. She was unresponsive when she was discovered. Missy died shortly after the paramedics arrived, and the investigation into her murder began immediately.Chilling video footage from the church showed a person carrying a hammer while opening and closing various rooms around the building. At one point, they broke open a door with the hammer. The person’s clothing included a helmet, gloves and shin guards. They also wore a vest emblazoned with ‘police’.\nThe suspect in the church via Midlothian Texas Police DepartmentThe footage of the person in the riot gear was analysed, but the gender of the assailant was inconclusive. The killer was between 5’2” and 5’8”, their feet predominately pointed outward, and they walked with a limp.Glass from broken windows scattered the floor of the building, guiding police on a trail that helped track the person's movements in the riot gear. They also found marks on the church's backdoor, indicating how the perpetrator accessed the building, initially leading police to believe that the incident may have been a robbery that had gone wrong. However, after searching the property, it was evident that nothing was missing from the church nor from Missy, who was still wearing her wedding ring.The police were concerned, there hadn’t been a homicide in the area in years, and they weren’t used to dealing with a murder investigation. The video footage was released to the public in the hope of finding the person featured in the video, and the police told viewers to note the specific gait with which the person walked. Within hours of its release, the police department was inundated with tips from the public, and the FBI and US marshal’s office stepped in to help field calls.The police subpoenaed Missy’s phone and recovered messages detailing flirtatious and intimate conversations on LinkedIn. There were also strange and creepy messages from a man Missy had shown a friend a few days before her death. Police believed that she had been in contact with her killer, and the names of the people on LinkedIn were never released.Missy posted a lot on social media about her upcoming boot camps, and the night before she was killed, she said that come rain or shine, the class would still go ahead. Unfortunately, her advertising made her movements easily trackable.Missy’s bootcamp post via Facebook.com After his alibi was verified, Brandon Bevers was questioned by investigators, wanting to know who would harm his wife. He told investigators he couldn’t think of anyone who would like to hurt Missy. Judging by the fact that Missy’s licensed gun was left in her car in the church carpark, Missy didn’t think there was anyone who wanted to harm her either.Brandon told the police that his marriage to Missy was great and that they were happy. Still, investigators found out that the marriage was in disrepair and fraught with financial issues and infidelity.On the 22nd of April, Brandon’s father, Randy, went to a dry cleaners in town with a woman’s blood-stained shirt, asking for it to be cleaned. He told the employee that the blood was from breaking up a dog fight, but Missy’s murder story had been all over the news, so the employee called the police. A warrant was issued for the shirt, and when analysed, it looked like someone had already tried to clean the blood off the shirt beforehand.Police also noticed that Randy had a similar physique to the person in the security footage from the church, and he walked with a limp. However, Randy was in California when Missy was murdered, and his alibi cleared him as a suspect. Brandon’s sister, Kristi, corroborated her father’s story that the dog fight happened, and the report eventually came back as positive for canine blood, but the damage was done by then. The community chastised randy, and despite all of the statements being made public, he was, in their eyes, guilty.A few weeks later, police found security footage from a nearby sporting goods store and discovered a Nissan Altima driving around a nearby carpark a few hours before the murder. This video was also released to the public, but the car owner never came forward, and no one knew who the car belonged to.\nThe surveillance footage of the Nissan Altima via SWFAThere was another vehicle that the police didn’t enlist the help of the public in finding. It was a dark SUV seen leaving the church carpark on the same morning, around 4.30 am.Some months later, in the fall of 2019, the police realised that a tip had been phoned in multiple times during the investigation. The new lead was regarding former Lancaster police officer Bobby Wayne Henry. He was also a tactical officer who admitted to police that he still owned his riot gear but didn’t fit him anymore.Henry was a licensed security guard who worked Missy’s funeral and attended mass at Creekside Church of Christ. Henry was suspended from the police due to an aggravated sexual assault in 1996. He owned a similar car to the second vehicle police were looking for information on, and he also walked with a limp.Police sought the advice of a forensic podiatrist to compare the walk of Henry and the masked assailant in the video footage. But the findings were inconclusive.However, the main issue with Henry being a suspect in Missy’s murder was that he was 6’1” tall. Far too large to be the person in the security footage. However, the second search warrant issued by the police turned up multiple devices that contained child pornography.In June 2017, Henry was arrested for the pornography charges and took part in an interview from jail with Dallas’ WFAA News. He denied knowing Missy or even her name, and eventually, his alibi for the night of Missy’s murder was corroborated.He was released without charge after 70 days in jail. To date, he hasn’t been charged for the child pornography in his possession. He was also ruled out as a person of interest in Missy’s homicide.Despite help from the FBI and seemingly strong suspects, the case reached a dead end. Unease quickly rippled through the city of Midlothian with Missy’s killer still free to wander the streets. Internet sleuths began to comb the internet for clues to try and help find Missy’s murderer, but some of them went too far in their search.More recently, Missy’s daughter, Hannah, spoke to Inside Edition and recalled the struggle she and her family had been through since her mother’s death;“I’ve had people on Facebook message me and say … ‘Your dad did this, your dad killed your mom’. My dad loved my mom and I know that 100 percent.”Missy’s killer was between 5’2” and 5’8”, their feet predominately point outward, and they walked with a limp. This person could be a man or a woman. Police are still looking for the owner of the Nissan Altima.Oak Farms Dairy is still offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Missy’s killer. Anyone with information can share tips with police by texting MIDL and a tip to 847411 or calling Ellis County Crime Stoppers at 972–937–7297.Recent PostsSee AllThe Acid Bath MurdersThe Terrifying Beast of JerseyThe Killer Who Inspired Jeepers Creepers©2022 The True Crime Edition.bottom of page"

When she entered the Church at 4:18 am, it would be the last time Missy Bevers, a fitness instructor, was seen alive.Roughly 30 minutes before her arrival, surveillance cameras captured footage of an individual dressed head to toe in mismatched law enforcement tactical gear entering the church. Wielding a hammer, the killer methodically yet casually opened doors and inspected various rooms waiting for her to arrive.At 5:00 am, Missy’s first student arrived, only to discover Bevers’ lifeless and bloodied body sprawled on the floor with horrific puncture wounds.So, who killed Missy Bevers?In the subsequent investigation, law enforcement unearthed scant evidence, with the video footage posing more questions than providing answers.A noticeable “pigeon-toed” gait exhibited by the assailant’s right foot added a layer of intrigue to the case. This trait is typically more prevalent in females, fueling speculation about the killer’s gender.The relaxed and assured demeanor of the perpetrator raised suspicions about their familiarity with the church surroundings. Had they visited the church on prior occasions? This raises yet another question.How did the murderer know Missy was going to hold class inside the Creekside Church, as opposed to the group’s usual location —outside in the church’s parking lot?The previous night, Missy posted on Facebook to inform her students the class would be held indoors due to expected rain. Whoever the perp was, they had read her post and planned accordingly — even scouting out the church parking lot around 2:00 the morning of the murder in what appeared to be a 2010–2012 Nissan Altima.Investigators also believe her killer had communicated with her several times via LinkedIn three days before. Missy’s friend described the messages as “creepy and strange.” But more than that, they were also sexually charged and “flirtatious.”Was this the killer? If so, what was the motive? A psycho stalker who felt spurned by Missy? Or did she know the person intimately?Law enforcement confirmed via text messages between Bevers and her husband “an ongoing financial and marital struggle as well as intimate/personal relationships external to the marriage.” Her husband’s alibi was checked out and cleared as a suspect. Others near Missy also had solid alibis.As of today, no arrests have been made in connection with the murder. The looming question persists: will the truth ever be revealed, bringing justice to Missy Bevers and solace to her grieving family?Missy Bevers, May you Rest In Peace.Note: This story strikes a personal chord with me. I was born and raised only less than an hour from Midlothian, Texas. I’ve visited and been through the city dozens of times. I wrote this article to promote continued awareness.

The group planted a tree at a park in honor of Missy Bevers. Tuesday marked seven years since Bevers was killed inside the Creekside Church in Midlothian as she prepared for an early morning fitness class. When her students showed up, they found her body. Disturbing security video showed the suspect wearing what appeared to be tactical gear walking through the church. That person was never caught.

Family and friends hope keeping Bevers’ memory alive could lead to new tips. \"Cases sometimes just can't be solved without the knowledge that someone has. And I just feel like it's super important to do that and to always continue sharing the information on Missy’s case and other cases so they can get solved,\" said Renae Rodden, one of Bever’s friends and a local podcast host. Rodden said it’s important because Bever represents all women. \"We're all wives, mothers, sisters, daughters. And she's no longer here, so we're going to be her voice and keep her case alive until it's solved,\" she said.

Nearly as many members of the media planted themselves on the sidelines, cameras aimed and ready. A reddish-brown stone bore the inscription “In Loving Memory of Missy Bevers.” It was signed “Friends of TCB.”\nThe podcasters from True Crime Broads had invited their listeners to the tree-planting ceremony at a park in Midlothian, a city of around 40,000 located roughly a half-hour’s drive southwest from Dallas. Some wore custom black T-shirts to the event, the words “Justice for Missy, 4/18/2016” scrawled onto a large red heart.\nThat Tuesday marked seven years since 45-year-old Terri “Missy” Bevers, who had lived in nearby Red Oak, was murdered in a Midlothian church. Many residents were certain that her case would be solved in the days after. That confidence has gradually waned in the weeks, months and years since.\nAttendees bowed their heads in prayer during opening remarks. Then, dressed in one of the custom shirts, True Crime Broads’ Renae Rodden thanked the modest crowd for showing up and lending support.\n“Missy was a mother, a sister, a wife, a daughter — and, you know, it could have been any of us,” Rodden said, her speech punctuated by the sound of kids horsing around on the park’s playground.\n“Together, I think that we are able to just come together, make sure that tips keep coming in, people keep talking about this case,” she continued. “Because when people quit talking, when tips quit coming in, the case goes cold.”\nThe ceremony was brief. A former Midlothian police officer offered reassurance that investigators are still sorting through pieces of the jigsaw puzzle behind the scenes.\nBevers’ widower and three daughters desperately want justice. So do true-crime lovers who’d never met the fitness instructor in real life before becoming transfixed by her bizarre death.\nAttendee Pepper Kuykendall gestured to the overcast sky and wondered aloud whether it would rain. The recently planted red oak could probably use it, after all.\nclick to enlarge A wildflower field sits adjacent to Creekside Church. Alicia Claytor Blue and orange wildflowers painted the field adjacent to the Creekside Church the afternoon of the tree-planting ceremony. A woman exited the imposing taupe building and beelined for her car. The church’s exterior doors shut and locked behind her.\nReports of the suspect’s height varied: anywhere from 5-foot-2 to 5-foot-8. The person’s strange walk could have been from some sort of temporary injury or condition, police have said.\nBevers’ husband, Brandon Bevers, was out of state on the day of the murder. Brandon’s father, Randy Bevers — whose right leg purportedly had an outward pronation similar to the culprit’s — was traveling in California, the Observer reported in 2017. With ironclad alibis, the Bevers men were dismissed as suspects by law enforcement.\n“Because when people quit talking, when tips quit coming in, the case goes cold.” – Renae Rodden, True Crime Broads podcast tweet this\nStill, speculation has flourished amidst a dearth of publicly available information. Web sleuths ask: Could the husband have hired a hitman to do the deed while he was conveniently out of town? Could it have been a robbery gone wrong? Could the perpetrator have killed Missy in a jealous fit of rage?\nIf anyone gets that, it’s Brandon. Speaking with the Observer in early April, he said that, for whatever reason, some folks flat-out refuse to accept the truth.\n“I've always walked a fairly straight line in my whole life. You know, I was a Boy Scout,” Brandon said. “I've never really strayed outside of what was expected of me socially — or as a son, or as a father or husband — so, to be considered a suspect in your wife's murder, through the interrogation and questioning process, it really, really put me in a dark place.”\nMurder certainly isn’t common in Midlothian. The most prevalent crimes are assault and theft, said Assistant Police Chief Scott Brown of the Midlothian Police Department. Local law enforcement wants the community to know that the case hasn’t gone cold, and Brown cited several ways in which investigators are still hard at work.\nThousands of tips flooded in after Missy died. Even in the past year the department has received more than 50 new ones, Brown said via email. But misinformation abounds online, and there are plenty of “outlandish theories” that harm the investigation.\n“We will continue to rely on help from the tips we receive with the hope that someone with true knowledge of the crime — not theory or speculation — decides to come forward,” he continued.\nclick to enlarge A commemorative stone sits next to the tree planted in Missy Bevers' name. Alicia Claytor Some of the True Crime Broads’ listeners at the tree-planting ceremony resemble fictional podcast fans in Only Murders In the Building, Hulu’s murder mystery series starring Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. In the show, the three protagonists launch a podcast chronicling their efforts to solve a New York City murder. They sometimes interact with a cadre of concerned fellow citizens-cum-eager armchair detectives who want to help out in any way they can.\nTrue Crime Broads supporters share that sincerity, that genuine interest in justice.\nPepper Kuykendall has kind eyes and a bushy white mustache and wore a trucker hat on the day of the ceremony. His wife, Dianna, has equally kind eyes and donned one of the custom black “Justice for Missy” T-shirts. The Kuykendalls have lived in Midlothian for some 30 years. They remember when there was just one red light in town; it’s grown a lot since then.\n“It was very shocking, especially being in a church,” Dianna said.\nBefore long, Midlothian resident Christi Bina joined in conversation with the Kuykendalls. The three chatted about another North Texas-area case, this one concerning a man who’d gone missing several years ago under suspicious circumstances.\nDianna mentioned that her kids had lived in the city where the man disappeared.\n“So,” Bina quipped, “they know his wife did it?”\nThat question got them talking excitedly, sometimes all at once. Pepper inquired: How did the missing man’s wife get a death certificate so fast with no body? Dianna asked: If your spouse went missing, would you have their cellphone turned off immediately after?\nIt’s another curious case where part of the intrigue seems to stem from the victim’s close geographical proximity. True crime buffs really hate it when things don’t add up.\nIf something so terrible could happen to someone in their community, who’s to say that it couldn’t happen to them?\nSome women won’t take out their trash cans alone at night. Rodden bought a gun and carries it wherever she goes.\nBina recalled that she’d watch her grandkids play in the front yard of her home, near where Bevers lived. After the murder, Bina gave police a ring. “I've got my grandchildren out here playing. Do I need to be concerned?” she asked them.\nclick to enlarge A Midlothian billboard still advertises the reward for help in finding Missy Bevers' killer. Alicia Claytor April 18, 2016, was a nightmarish day for Brandon Bevers. He was on a fishing trip in Mississippi when he reportedly got the call from a student in Missy’s class. He was told that there’d been a robbery, and that Missy was “no longer with us.”\nStill, Lawson said she knows that the family has endured a horrific several years. She can’t blame them for emotions running high.\nShe and Rodden estimate that they’ve covered Missy’s killing in at least 100 episodes. They're constantly mining for new angles, something that’s getting increasingly difficult. They’ll reiterate the same facts and dispel the same myths for the benefit of new listeners. It hasn’t appeared to wear on their dedication to the case one bit.\nLawson and Rodden want police to release additional information about the murder, such as another picture or video clip of the killer. They want to see greater media coverage to help keep Missy’s story alive. Law enforcement could be just one tip away from cracking the case. It might take only a single, seemingly inconsequential detail to do it.\nThe two podcasters and Brandon may disagree on how to approach the case, but they all share the same aim: for Missy’s killer to get caught.\nRodden said she worked with Missy for a time at Vault Denim, which she described as a jeans company that “was kind of like multilevel marketing.” Lawson said her children are the same ages as the three Bevers girls.\nAt the ceremony on April 18, Rodden pressed the importance of the case while talking with the media. Newscasters eventually broke down their equipment, and the Kuykendalls and Bina went their separate ways. A slight breeze rustled the red oak tree’s leaves, moving them to dance. On the road leading out of Midlothian, the setting sun broke through a canopy of clouds.\nThere she is, on the left side of a striking red billboard: a photo of Missy wearing a purple tank top, hair cascading just past her shoulders. On the right side of the sign, a grainy image of her killer in tactical gear, stalking the empty halls of Creekside Church.\nContact:\nSimone Carter\nJoin Today\nSign Up\nTrending\nNews\nHillcrest Road Closure the Latest DART Silver Line Headache for Dallas\nBy Kelly Dearmore\nNews\n116,259 Dallas Households Could Soon Be Without Affordable Connectivity\nBy Jacob Vaughn\nMarijuana\nTexas Hemp Shop Owners Often Find Themselves in a Legal Haze\nBy Jacob Vaughn\nHousing\nDallas Highlighted in List of Top 10 Change-Making Cities for 2023\nBy Simone Carter\nView This Week's Print Issue\nWhere To Find Dallas Observer In Print\nEditorial\nNews\nFood & Drink\nArts & Culture\nMusic\nThings to Do\nObserver Events\nNewsletters\nMarketing\nPromotions & Free Stuff\nAdvertise With Us\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nMore\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nStaff\nCareers\nFlipbook Archive\nVoice Media Group\nDenver Westword\nNew Times Broward-Palm Beach\nMiami New Times\nPhoenix New Times\nV Audience Labs\nV Digital Services\nEditorial\nNews\nFood & Drink\nArts & Culture\nMusic\nThings to Do\nObserver Events\nNewsletters\nMarketing\nPromotions & Free Stuff\nAdvertise With Us\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nMore\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nStaff\nCareers\nFlipbook Archive\nVoice Media Group\nDenver Westword\nNew Times Broward-Palm Beach\nMiami New Times\nPhoenix New Times\nV Audience Labs\nV Digital Services\nfacebook\ninstagram\ntwitter\nlinkedin\ntiktok\nthreads\nCalifornia Privacy Policy\nCalifornia Collection Notice\nDo Not Sell My Info"
