2023\nThe path to peace in Ukraine runs directly through Putin’s red lines\nBy\nOleksiy Goncharenko\nAs Russia’s invasion of Ukraine approaches the one-year mark, the Western response is still being undermined by exaggerated fears of escalation and misplaced concerns over the dangers of “provoking Putin.” But while Western leaders and commentators continue to warn of dire consequences if Ukraine dares to resist, the experience of the past twelve months tells a very different story.\nSince the invasion began, Ukraine has repeatedly defied the Kremlin and ignored Russia’s red lines. On each occasion, Moscow has failed to make good on its bloodcurdling threats and has instead retreated to new red lines. It should now be clear to any rational observer that in reality, Putin’s red lines are nothing less than a roadmap to Russian defeat in Ukraine.\nRussia has a long history of imposing imaginary red lines on Ukraine and the West. Many years before Russia’s attack on Ukraine began with the 2014 seizure of Crimea, Kremlin leaders were warning their Western counterparts that Ukraine as a whole was a red line. Following the onset of open Russian aggression against Ukraine nine years ago, Moscow then claimed that any form of military aid to Kyiv was a red line for Russia.\nOver the past year or so, we have seen successive red lines drawn over the delivery to Ukraine of anti-tank weapons, artillery, air defense systems, and tanks. All of these red lines have been crossed without provoking the threatened Russian response. It is entirely reasonable to assume that the most recently announced Russian red line over the delivery of fighter jets to Ukraine will prove equally ineffective.\nLikewise, Russian attempts to impose red lines over the liberation of occupied Ukrainian land have repeatedly been exposed as toothless. In September 2022, Vladimir Putin oversaw a grandiose ceremony in the Kremlin announcing the illegal annexation of four partially occupied Ukrainian provinces. These regions had joined Russia “forever,” the Russian dictator declared. However, when the advancing Ukrainian military freed Kherson within weeks of Putin’s proclamation, Russian forces simply retreated.\nStay updated\nLearn more\nFollow us on social media and support our work\nsupport our work\nConflict\nDisinformation\nEuropean Union\nNuclear Nonproliferation\nPolitics & Diplomacy\nRussia\nUkraine\nUnited States and Canada\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nTerms and conditions of use\nIntellectual Independence Policy\nGovernment Funding Review Process\nPolicy on donor acceptance and disclosure\nModern Day Slavery and Anti-Human Trafficking Policy\nPhoto credits\nThis website or its third-party tools use cookies, which are necessary for its functioning and required to achieve the purposes illustrated in the cookie policy.

These were, after all, the first explicit threats to use nuclear weapons from a major power since the end of the Cold War.\nMoscow’s intention was clear: draw a red line and scare NATO out of supplying Kyiv with any weapons that could threaten Russia’s occupation and continued assault on Ukraine. Yet, the West doubled down and provided unprecedented amounts of heavy weaponry, ammunition, air defense systems, and training to Ukrainian troops. The Kremlin’s bluff was called, but Putin did not push the big red nuclear button.\nMoscow’s threats have been all bark and no bite. Their ability to escalate is limited, and as a result they have forced themselves to rely on bellicose rhetoric. The West should recognize Russia’s threats as hollow and stand firm by continuing to deliver weapons and aid and moving toward security guarantees for Ukraine.\nFirstly, military concerns and the internal threat of societal backlash like that seen after Russia’s 2022 partial mobilization are preventing the Kremlin from seriously retaliating against Ukraine or the West. Although Russia is not facing imminent defeat, it is occupied with Ukraine’s counteroffensive. With the majority of its military bogged down in defensive positions in eastern Ukraine after nearly 18 months of war, any consideration of opening an additional front in Ukraine, much less against another country or NATO member, is an absurd prospect.\nWhile the frontlines remain relatively stable, Moscow will likely continue its war of attrition and make sporadic threats to project strength internally and externally – all while ignoring most of its mounting problems. Nuclear war is unlikely to be a serious consideration unless there is an existential threat to the Russian state, significant “Russian” territory or the regime’s survival. It is hard to see how Western arms supplies would meet this threshold.\nEven assuming that Moscow does not opt for a nuclear response, Russia still lacks the capacity for real military escalation. What’s more, unless faced with wholesale defeat at the front rather than incremental setbacks, it is hard to see how it would be in Moscow’s interests: it could lead to uncontrollable escalation, a full-scale defeat or the end of Putin’s authoritarian system. A war with NATO, let alone a nuclear war, would be far too risky.\nFor Moscow to defend its red lines effectively in a conventional military sense, it would need to mobilize hundreds of thousands of additional men, which it is ill-prepared to do. With limited options to stimulate its highly sanctioned economy and growing discontent over the government’s handling of the war, a new wave of mobilization could lead to an even greater backlash than the one last year.\nTo preserve the fragile harmony within Russian society and maintain public support for the regime, the Kremlin must make every effort to avoid further mobilization and continue with its narrative that everything is going according to plan. That implies it will not follow through on its outlandish threats.\nnews\nJoshua R. Kroeker\nJoshua R.

(Natalia Kolesnikova/AFP/Getty Images)Listen7 minShareComment on this storyCommentAdd to your saved storiesSaveUkrainian drone strikes on Moscow, once unthinkable, have now become routine. The Russian capital region was targeted for six straight days recently, and while the drones haven’t caused much damage, they disrupted flight operations at airports and have helped to bring the war home. Also this month, other suspected Ukrainian drones destroyed a Russian bomber at an air base south of St. Petersburg and struck a railway station in the Kursk region of western Russia. The Kremlin’s response appeared to be limited to expressions of outrage.Need something to talk about? Text us for thought-provoking opinions that can break any awkward silence.ArrowRightIt seems hard to remember now, but at the beginning of this conflict, the West — and the White House, in particular — was desperately worried that attacks inside Russia would cross a “red line” that would lead Russian President Vladimir Putin to dramatically up the ante, perhaps even to employ nuclear weapons. More recent experience suggests that, for all his bluster, Putin is rational enough not to escalate a limited war that he is already losing into a wider war with NATO that he cannot possibly win.Yet President Biden appears as worried as ever about provoking Putin. How else to explain the administration’s hesitation to provide F-16s to Ukraine and the failure to provide long-range ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) or to challenge the Russian blockade of the Black Sea? In all three instances, the Biden administration is trying to play it safe but is actually dragging the conflict out and undermining Kyiv’s chances of success — even as U.S. officials blame the Ukrainians for their lack of rapid progress on the ground.AdvertisementOn F-16s, the news would appear good: Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway recently pledged, with U.S. permission, to donate more than 70 of the fighter jets to Ukraine. But read the fine print: Training of Ukrainian pilots is going to take so long that the first Ukrainian F-16s will not be ready to fly until next summer at the earliest. In other words, the aircraft will not arrive until long after the current counteroffensive is over and might not be delivered in sufficient numbers even for next year’s fighting season.Followthis authorMax Boot's opinionsFollowThis is ridiculous, given that Ukrainian pilots could be trained on the F-16 in just four months. Training should have started last year. But even now, the Biden administration can still turbocharge the process by bringing more Ukrainian pilots to the United States, where the U.S. Air Force already trains some 400 of its own F-16 pilots every year. The Pentagon, with far greater resources than the Dutch or Danish, also could speed up the provision of the aircraft and their maintenance systems. It won’t make any difference to Putin if Ukraine’s F-16s come from Denmark or the United States.But instead of doing everything they can to deliver the F-16s as quickly as possible, U.S. officials denigrate the aircraft’s importance, telling journalists that it won’t be a “magic weapon” because of Russia’s dense air defenses. Of course, no single weapon will win the war by itself. But retired Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove — a former commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe and a veteran F-16 pilot with nearly 3,000 hours flying the aircraft — told me that the F-16, which is much more advanced than Ukraine’s existing Soviet-made fighters, would greatly boost Ukraine’s capabilities.Advertisement“The F-16 doesn’t have to fly over Russian territory to shoot down Russian drones and helicopters,” he said. “You don’t have to go there to kill there. You can kill from distance.” He explained that, by employing the F-16s in conjunction with other systems (such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS), the Ukrainians could gradually degrade Russian air defenses to allow the F-16s greater freedom of maneuver — not only to defend Ukrainian airspace but also to support Ukrainian ground forces. (Indeed, Ukrainian military intelligence claimed last week to have destroyed a Russian S-400 air-defense system in Crimea.)Even more urgent than the F-16s, Breedlove told me, is the provision of ATACMS. Its rockets could be fired from the same launchers as the HIMARS system that the Ukrainians already possess. “It would take less than a day to incorporate into their fighting force,” he said. “That munition provides long-range, precision strike with a heavier warhead. It would bring under fire the entire peninsula of Crimea and, if employed correctly, would make Crimea untenable for Russian military forces.”Yet the administration still won’t provide ATACMS, citing fear of provoking Putin and claiming that there are too few in the U.S. arsenal. In fact, the U.S. Army has as many as 3,000 ATACMS; sending a few hundred to Ukraine won’t deplete U.S. defenses. “This is BS,” tweeted retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army Europe. “If we don’t have enough, why haven’t we increased production? This is about a shortage of political will, not a shortage of ATACMS.”AdvertisementA similar shortage of political will is evident in the administration’s unwillingness to more forcefully challenge Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea coast after the collapse of a grain export deal last month. Since then, Russia has been targeting Ukrainian grain facilities. Putin wants to bring Ukraine to its knees and doesn’t care about inflicting hunger on millions of people around the world who need Ukrainian grain to survive. Yet the Biden administration is not doing enough to contest Putin’s reprehensible power play.Retired Adm. James Stavridis, another former commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Europe, told me last week: “We are seeing a dangerous potential precedent in not more aggressively contesting Russia’s de facto maritime control of a large swath of international waters in the Black Sea.” He argues that NATO ships should start escorting merchant vessels carrying food and fuel, keep NATO combat aircraft on constant patrol over the Black Sea, and provide anti-ship missiles and drones to Ukraine to keep the Russian fleet at bay.There is no indication that the Biden administration is seriously pursuing any of those options. Its preferred alternative is to increase grain exports via the Danube River, even though Ukraine will be hard-put to match the volume of foodstuffs it shipped out of Black Sea ports.AdvertisementThe Biden administration deserves praise for committing more than $43 billion in military aid to Ukraine. Most recently, the administration agreed to send badly needed cluster munitions. But it continues to drag its feet on providing other critical assistance that Ukraine desperately needs at a time when its counteroffensive is not advancing as rapidly as hoped.Breedlove doesn’t mince words in explaining why the administration isn’t more aggressive: “Our administration does not want to see Ukraine succeed wildly,” he says, “because we are deterred, we are intimidated, and we don’t want Mr. Putin to widen or deepen the war.”Biden’s fears, once understandable, now seem excessive. The Ukrainian drone strikes inside Russia should relieve exaggerated fears about the consequences of crossing Putin’s supposed red lines. Providing more aid to Ukraine won’t significantly raise the risk of a wider war — but it could shorten the existing conflict.Share CommentsOpinions on the war in UkraineHAND CURATEDOpinion|A MAGA-created nightmare is unfolding for Ukraine3 hours agoOpinion|A MAGA-created nightmare is unfolding for Ukraine3 hours agoOpinion|How the West’s waffling undermines Ukraine’s war effortJanuary 10, 2024Opinion|How the West’s waffling undermines Ukraine’s war effortJanuary 10, 2024Opinion|How the best chance to win the Ukraine war was lostJanuary 9, 2024Opinion|How the best chance to win the Ukraine war was lostJanuary 9, 2024View 3 more storiesLoading...TOP STORIESAdviceMoral dilemmas, relationships, parenting and moreMiss Manners: Chatty airline passengers talk over seatmateCarolyn Hax: Niece may not realize wedding plan is inconsiderate to older guestsAsk Sahaj: I need closure after a close friend ghosted meRefreshTry a different topicSign in or create a free account to save your preferenceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com © 1996-2024 The Washington Post"
