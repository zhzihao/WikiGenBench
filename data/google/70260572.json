The already legendary schooner was dubbed the âPride\nof Baltimore.â Its shipâs captain, the renowned Thomas Boyle, who had lost men\nin battle and had been wounded himself, praised Roberts for displaying âthe most\nintrepid courage.â Readjusting to civilian life as a free Black carpenter and laborer,\nthe ex-privateer purchased a home for $150 on Ann Street in Fells Point. Such was\nRobertsâ reputation, that over the ensuing decades, despite the horrific racism of the era, he marched in uniform alongside the cityâs prominent citizens\non civic occasions. His 1861 obituariesâhe lived to 95ârecalled\nhis patriotism, âmany hair-breath escapes,â and desire to always\nbe remembered as âone of the defenders of his native city should\nthe necessity have arrived to take up arms in its defense.â\nHis âbrave character,â it was noted, was âadorned with amicable\ndisposition,â such that ânews of death will cause\nheartfelt sorrow.â\nBattle\nbetween the\nChasseur, a Fells\nPoint privateer, and\nBritish schooner\nSt. Lawrence off\nHavanna, 1815. âAdam Weingartner, public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\nFree Black seaman\nand a hero of the\nWar of 1812,\nGeorge Roberts âCourtesy of the Maryland Center for History and Culture, PVF\nFells Point reflections. âVideo by J.M. Giordano\nEarly Fells\nPoint developer,\nAnn Bond Fell. âCourtesy of the Maryland Center for History and Culture, 1986.105.4\nPay day for the stevedores, c. 1905. âLibrary of Congress\nemarkably, the streets of Fells Point, like\nmany in the earliest years of the city,\nwere not formally segregated during its\nso-called âgolden era,â which peaked\nwith the War of 1812 and lasted until the Civil War.\n(Baltimoreâs infamous housing segregation law,\nwhich stated that no Black resident could move onto\na block in which the majority of the residents were\nwhite and vice versa, came in 1910.) All seven of the\nresidential alleys in Fells Point had white and Black\nhouseholds, as Mary Ellen Hayward, author of Baltimoreâs\nAlley Houses, discovered when she examined\nthe cityâs first directory to note âhouseholders of colorâ\nin 1808. Eight of the larger streets, too, were at least somewhat integrated with Black caulkers, laborers,\nlaundresses, blacksmiths, barbers, and their\nchildrenâa trend Hayward traces through subsequent\ndirectories. When Douglass, known as Frederick\nBailey as a boy, lived in Fells Point with the\nslave-owning Auld family, âa German baker\nhad a shop on the southwest corner of Aliceanna\nand Happy Alley,â Hayward writes, âbut there was\nalso a âcolored groceryâ on the same block.â\nBlack maritime business owner Isaac Myers, c. 1875. âLIBRARY OF CONGRESS\nâThat said, Frederick Douglassâ\nlife changed dramatically because\nhe was sent to Baltimore,â continues\nFields. âHe might not have survived\notherwise. But once heâs here,\nhe also sees Black men, women, and\nchildren auctioned off at the foot of Broadway and others separated\nfrom their families and put on ships headed to New Orleans.â\nâThe light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on\nthe wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scow\nof stone, I went, unasked, and helped them,â recalls Douglass in\nhis 1845 memoir. âWhen we had finished, one of them came to me\nand asked me if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, âAre ye a\nslave for life?â I told him that I was. The good Irishman seemed to be\ndeeply affected by the statement. He said to the other that it was a\npity so fine a little fellow as myself should be a slave for life. He said\nit was a shame to hold me. They both advised me to run away to the\nnorth; that I should find friends there, and that I should be free.â\nâFells Point is a place with a lot of history, a lot of issues, a lot\nof different people from all walks of life thrown together in a tight\ngeographic area,â Fields says. âItâs the most fascinating neighborhood\nin the city.â\nLocal historian\nLou Fields stands next\nto the Frederick Douglass\nmemorial sculpture.-Photography By J.M. Giordano\nTugboats at Fells Point, circa 1950s.âPhotography by Tom Scilipoti\nIt was in the middle of the Fells Point âStop the\nRoadâ citizen uprising in 1972 that Tony and Laura\nNorris stumbled across a dingy bar called The Lone\nStar among the vacant rowhomes and dilapidated\nboardinghouses. Both were musicians and teachers,\nbut Laura had gotten ill and couldnât work for a period\nand while they were figuring out what to do next, a\nfriend ventured to Fells Point looking for office space.\nUnable to find anything suitable, a realtor pointed\nhim toward a small saloon for sale. âHe came back\nand said, âLetâs buy a bar,ââ the now-82-year-old Tony\nNorris recalls. âSo, I called a Baltimore friend who was\nin California teaching, and said, âLoan me $3,000,â or\nwhatever it was for the down payment. At that time,\nyou could buy almost everything in the neighborhood.\nI think we paid $14,000 for the liquor license\nand the building, but there wasnât much there. There\nwas an old room in the back that had a kitchen that\nhad never been finished. One of our customers who\nwas handy said, âWell, Iâll help fix the kitchen up.ââ\nFrom top: Berthaâs\nowners Laura and Tony Norris\nin front of their beloved\nbar and restaurant today; the memorial stained glass\nwindow and the inspiration\nfor the name of Berthaâs.âPHOTOGRAPHY BY J.M. GIORDANO\nLeadbetters\nTavern, the Catâs Eye\nPub, and The Horse You Came In On in the 1970s.âCOURTESY OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FEDERAL HILL AND FELLâS POINT\nIn 1975, Irish-American Kenny Orye, who convinced some he\nran guns for the IRA, and Tony and Ana Marie Cushing opened the\nCatâs Eye Pub on Thames Street, taking their name from a West Virginia\ndistillery where Oryeâs uncle bought his moonshine. Contrary to whatâs been published elsewhere,\nAna Marie Cushing says with a smile,\nthe previous Harbor View tavern\nthere had not been a biker hangout,\nbut a lesbian bar. By the late 1970s\nand early â80s, the Catâs Eyeâs back\nroom had become a place to be after\nclosing time, recalled Steve Bunker,\na former seaman who operated the\nnearby China Sea Trading Company with a parrot perched on his\nshoulder. âAt 3 a.m. you could run into politicos, hookers, sailors,\ndeal-makers, illegal Irishmen, riffraff, and refugees,â Bunker, who\nnow lives in Maine, wrote years later in the Fells Point newsletter.\nâYou didnât ask too many questions about your stool mates, you just\ndrank your beer, passed a joint, and enjoyed the company.â\nThe music and bar crawl culture developed over time as more\npubs opened kitchens and got permits for live music. But things\nwere not excactly popping in the early â7os. âWhen first opened, someone would say, âLetâs go over to The Horse\nor the Catâs Eye for a beerââthere was this sense we\nwere all in it togetherâand youâd get into your car and\ndrive around the corner and have no trouble parking\nright in front,â the now-84-year-old Tony Norris says.\nâIt was that empty down here.â\nIn the late â60s, John Waters, Glenn Milstead, aka Divine, and\nfriends began making pilgrimages to Fells Point, finding new partners\nin subversion. MICA graduate Vincent Peraino, who was among\nthe influx of artists, became Watersâ set designer. Susan Lowe, a\npainter who later dated Orye (some of her paintings still hang in the\nCatâs Eye), appeared in nearly every Waters film. Other Fells Point\nDreamlanders included Mink Stole, George Figgs, Paul Swift, Peter\nKoper, and Bob Adams. âThe Hollywood Bakery, that was Vincentâs\ncommune, and it was right next door to Peteâs Hotel, where Edith\nMassey worked as a bartender and we hung out,â Waters recalls with\na laugh. âIt was the worst possible time down there and it was the\ncheapest possible place. Drinks were 30 cents. Divine hated it. He\ncalled it a âhobo bar.ââ\nâFells Point was welcoming to all kinds of people,\nthat was the thing that was so amazing,â Waters continues,\nnoting he once did a fashion shoot at the Apex\nadult movie theater on Broadway, which somehow coexisted\namong the churches and families in Upper\nFells. âPaul Swift would jump up and dance naked\non the bars. They werenât gay bars. It was gay and\nstraight. It was trans. Trans even then, and everybody\nreally got along. It was just cultural outlaws that didnât\nfit in their own minority.â\nFells Point\nFun Festival, late 1960s,\nwith a âStop The Roadâ\nbanner hanging on the\nside of a building.âCOURTESY OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF FEDERAL HILL AND FELLâS POINT\nAccording to Eney, one of then-Vice President Spiro\nAgnewâs female staffers, who secretly supported the\nFells preservationists, passed their completed National Register forms to Agnew to speed approval. Not realizing the obstacle\nthat placement on National Register would present to the highway he\nand local contractors favored, Agnew dutifully forwarded them on and\nâin three days we were on the National Register,â Eney recalled in 2004.\nâThe contractors were furious with\nAgnew because he was so dumb. He had no idea what he had done.â\nThe annual Fells Point Fun Festival, in fact, was first organized as\nan anti-highway fundraising effort. At the 1969 annual street party,\nBarbara Mikulski, a then-33-year-old social worker, shouted her opposition\nas future Mayor William Donald Schaefer tried to make his case\nfor the highway. âThe British couldnât take Fells Point, the termites\ncouldnât take Fells Point,â announced Mikulski, part of group calling\nthemselves Radio Free Fells Point. âAnd we donât think the State Roads\nCommission can take Fells Point either.â\nThe granddaughter of Polish bakers, Mikulski is a link between\nFells Pointâs long immigration history and the fight to the stop the\nhighway. âMy great-grandmother landed in Fells Point somewhere at âthe foot of Broadway,â which is what we called that\narea then, not Fells Point,â Mikulski says. âWhen\nshe came to this country and lived on Chester\nStreet near Holy Rosary, she could read, but she\nwas from Poland. One of the things she did to learn\nEnglish was to buy a newspaper and go down to\nthe Broadway Market and practice the language\nand the exchange of money, and so on. People were\nhelpful and she could trust that she wasnât going\nto be taken advantage of. The churches were like\nsettlement houses because they were bilingual.â\nâIn terms of the battle of âthe Road,â there was the\nparochial crowd, the preservationists, , the business\nownersâwe were all in it. Were the town hall meetings\ncontentious?â Mikulski adds. âItâs Bawlmer, hon.â\nThe fundamental problem behind the conception of\nâthe Roadââincluding the stretch known as âThe Highway\nto Nowhereâ that got built through majority-Black\nWest Baltimoreâis officials did not appreciate the value\nof working-class neighborhoods, Mikulski says. âThat\nwas certainly the attitude of Robert Moses,â the New\nYork highway builder who first designed Baltimoreâs\nplanned east-west highway. âHe did not see the value,\nhe didnât see the jobs that were there, and he didnât see\nwhat I call the social capital. It was the relationships\nthat were, and are, important in those communities.â\nCocina Luchadoras,\nSophiaâs Place, and\nCatâs Eye Pub.âPHOTOGRAPHY BY J.M. GIORDANO\nâItâs just not the same,â Manuel Alvarez, a chief engineer for the\ndeparted Baker-Whiteley tugboat company, told the same reporter,\nadding he had little desire to visit Fells Point anymore. âItâs just too...trendy. Itâs not just the way it used to be.â\nIn an oral history a generation later, Ed Kane, who founded the\nBaltimore water taxi operation in the â70s, said he thought Fells\nPoint âstill doesnât know what it wants to be when it grows up.â Itâs\nbeen in âstate of transition,â he said, for âmore than 200 years.â\nA ghost sign reading\nâVote Against Prohibitionâ\nremains visible\ntoday.-PHOTOGRAPHY BY J.M.

GIORDANO\nâI get the new business owners and the changes,â\nNorris continues. âI donât hate it, like a lot of the oldtimers.\nTheyâre coming from a good place. In their\nminds, theyâre doing the best thing that they can do\nfor the neighborhood. I believe that. Now, is it the best\nthing for the neighborhood? I donât know. The thing\nabout Fells Point is that had so much character, and\ncharacters, such charm. But people got older and sold\ntheir places and the new people, who are buying them,\nthis is how they see their future.â\nNorris acknowledges the water and rowhouses will\nbe always be here. As will reappointed warehouses and\nThamesâ Belgian block streets. But what else?\nâWhat I guess I mean, is that a neighborhood or is\nthat just brick and stone?â\nFind the Best in Baltimore\nAttorneys\nDentists\nDoctors\nRestaurants\nRealtors\nMore\nCamps\nHome\nPets\nRetirement\nSchools\nTravel\nWellness\nYou May Also Like\nHistory & Politics\nProhibition in Baltimore and The Colorful Story of Undercover Agent Kitty Costello\nHistory & Politics\nFormer Baltimore Stateâs Attorney Marilyn Mosby Found Guilty on Two Counts of Perjury\nArts & Culture\nJustine Barron’s New Book Presents the Fullest Story of Freddie Gray’s Death to Date\nIn 'They Killed Freddie Gray: The Anatomy of a Police Brutality Cover-Up,' the independent journalist analyzes problems with the established narrative that Gray was fatally injured during a ârough ride.â\nHistory & Politics\nDirected by professor and historian Martha Jones, the new Hard Histories initiative examines how racism has persisted over a century and a half at Hopkins.\nArts & Culture\nAwake Thy Soul: Singing the Centuries-Old ‘Sacred Harp’ in Baltimore\nArts & Culture\nâThe Body Politicâ Follows Brandon Scott as He Tackles Baltimore’s Gun Violence Epidemic\nMagazine\nSubscribe\nGive a Gift\nDigital Subscription\nManage Subscription\nTable of Contents\nConnect With Us\nTravel Finder\nFeatured Listing\nTaylor Made Deep Creek Vacations and Sales\n(301) 859-4182\n+ Destinations\nBaltimore\nCentral Maryland\nDeep Creek\nEastern Shore\nMassanutten\nOcean City\nOut of State\nVA\nWestern Maryland\n+ Activities\nAntiques\nBeaches\nCulture\nFamily Fun\nHistory & Culture\nOutdoor\nResort & Spa\nAbout\nCareers\nSubscriptions\nAdvertise\nStore\nBaltimore Creative Studio\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nAccessibility\nBaltimore Magazine\n© 2024 Rosebud Entertainment, LLC\nWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

Although most were vacant, hundreds of people were forcibly removed from their homes through the law of eminent domain, which allows the government to take private property for the benefit of the public after paying just compensation.\nIn her 2013 book Race, Class, Power, and Organizing in East Baltimore: Rebuilding Abandoned Communities in America, activist Dr. Marisela Gomez notes that “residents were being forced to relocate with no plan for how they could return to benefit from this good.”\nEBDI originally lacked community representation in its planning process. As a result, the Save Middle East Action Committee (SMEAC) was formed. For years, SMEAC fought for fair compensation and relocation terms. The group disbanded in November 2009 and was later replaced by BRACE.\nAlthough displaced residents were promised a path back, the area was a dead zone for a decade and a half due to slow progress. Investment and construction were further delayed by the Great Recession.\nGresham told The News-Letter that he didn’t learn that his home was being acquired until a SMEAC organizer came to his house and told him.\n“I didn’t read it in the paper, I didn’t get a letter, I didn’t get any phone calls — all I knew was that they were acquiring my property,” he said. “You would not have known it at all. They had no formal way of letting you know that your property was being acquired and you were going to have to move.”\nA 2018 article in the Baltimore Sun describes Gresham, who later became president of SMEAC, as “among those who avoided displacement.” He emphasized to The News-Letter that he and a few dozen others were only able to do so because of years of advocacy.\n“I didn’t get displaced because it was designated for me to stay. No, it was more like they dragged out the process, and we had to do a rally and articles and so many things,” he said. “It was a constant battle to get them to hear what we were saying and what they promised.”\n“I don’t want to call it ‘another Jim Crow’”\nGresham said that SMEAC had to fight “almost day and night” for safe demolition. Middle East Baltimore Stories chronicles how demolition procedures led to property damage and rat infestations, as well as psychological strain that manifested as increased crime and physical ailments like asthma and lead poisoning.\nLead poisoning, which has long afflicted poor and Black youth in Baltimore, is known to decrease cognitive function, increase aggression and ultimately worsen the cycle of poverty fueled by racist policies like redlining.\nA 2016 report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation attributes residents’ concerns about lead poisoning to a controversial study by the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Kennedy Krieger Institute. In 2000, researchers spread fertilizer made from human and industrial waste on the lawns of several homes in East Baltimore. While Hopkins claimed that the fertilizer successfully mitigated lead and that the community had been informed, many activists and lawmakers questioned whether the experiment had exploited poor, Black families.\nEBDI used wetting to reduce the spread of lead-contaminated dust during demolition. It also informed and educated residents extensively about planned construction, according to the report.\n“The demolition protocols developed for the East Baltimore Revitalization Initiative set a new national standard in the battle against lead poisoning and, more broadly, in the field of responsible redevelopment,” the report reads.\nThe authors of the report note that SMEAC had called for demolition to be paused until safety guarantees were implemented.\n“Eventually, EBDI and its partners agreed to work toward guaranteeing that demolition would not harm residents and took several key steps to achieve that goal,” the report reads.\nVernice Miller-Travis, a national leader in environmental justice who helped coin the term “environmental racism,” served as a member of an independent panel overseeing the demolition. In the report, she is quoted as commending EBDI’s safety measures.\n“I have not seen this level of caution and sensitivity in a community of color or low-income community in the U.S.,” she said. “It sets a new bar about how community development should be done.”\nIn the 1930s, the Home Owner’s Loan Corporation deemed non-white neighborhoods risky for mortgage support by outlining them in red on residential security maps. To this day, redlined neighborhoods in Baltimore are structurally disadvantaged. Ordinance 610, a 1911 housing segregation law in Baltimore, was a precursor to redlining nationwide. It was in part the legacy of a report initiated by the University’s former president Daniel Coit Gilman.\nAbout a century later, Daniels assumed Gilman’s position in 2009. In 2018, Daniels told The Guardian, “You can make the moral case of why, given the bounty of resources that we have, it’s incumbent on us to share with the city. But the other thing is to make clear that this is an enlightened form of self-interest. It is inconceivable that Hopkins would remain a pre-eminent institution in a city that continues to suffer decline.”\nAs Baltimore’s largest private anchor institution and Maryland’s largest private employer, Hopkins “seeks to create economic opportunities that are inclusive of diverse people and create wealth for individuals and communities.” This mission statement adorns the University’s web page on HopkinsLocal, an initiative launched in 2015.\nDue to the University’s ‘enlightened form of self-interest,’ Middle East’s own neighborhood anchor institutions suffered. For instance, Middle East Baltimore Stories mentions that the Sweet Prospect Baptist Church had been debt-free for decades before it was demolished. Although EBDI helped the church move to a nearby neighborhood, the new building required hundreds of thousands of dollars of renovation.\n“The church received a building,” the book reads, “but not a means to preserve the congregation.”\nSimilarly, Gresham highlighted that people who had been living in the same place for four generations were uprooted by EBDI. During the Great Migration, thousands of Black people came to Baltimore to escape racism in the South and find employment.\n“Families came here to have a better life only to later find out that it’s almost like another — I don’t want to call it ‘another Jim Crow’ — displacement of their lives. You put down your roots… and now someone says to you, ‘This area is designated for the rich and famous, and the poor and poverty doesn’t fit in,’” Gresham said. “Can you imagine what that’s like, when you were running away from something and running into something that almost has the same feeling?”\nHow has Hopkins impacted neighboring communities of color?\nEBDI states on its website that it is helping displaced residents return to what is now Eager Park by “defraying closing and moving costs, narrowing financing gaps” and ensuring that one third of houses are affordable.\nAccording to the website, displaced renters received vouchers “to rent affordably throughout the region,” and homeowners received five times the value of their homes on average, allowing them to “move mostly stable neighborhoods mortgage free.”\nHowever, many residents, Gresham said, already lacked financial stability before EBDI, making them unlikely to return.\nIn 2018, the Baltimore Sun reported that “just one in 10 displaced residents has returned or plans to, and fewer than a quarter have expressed interest.” President and CEO of EBDI Cheryl Washington told the Baltimore Sun that EBDI hired a consultant to track down displaced residents with whom it had lost touch.\nGresham questioned the EBDI’s ability to do so. Many residents moved out quickly, he said, and have been scattered across the city for almost two decades.\nAdditionally, though an EBDI survey found that “85 percent of displaced residents said they were better off after being relocated,” Gresham explained why this statistic is misleading.\n“You have to imagine the pain and uncomfortableness. First, you move me out like I’m a cattle and then you tell me, ‘Yeah, you can get back, but read the survey,’” he said. “Many people didn’t even respond to the survey because they were devastated.”\nBetween January 2006 and September 2018, EBDI has yielded 288 hires from Baltimore, only 23 of whom were EBDI-impacted residents.\nSince EBDI began, 490 local workers have retained employment by working on EBDI projects. Almost 40% of them are from Baltimore (161 of them from minority groups), and a quarter of them are from East Baltimore (107 from minority groups).\n“They came in and disrupted our lives. We thought that money would help to build businesses not only for the community, but by the community and with the community. That didn’t happen,” Gresham said. “The reinvestment money could have been a blessing for so many reasons.”\nGresham added that activists had to push for the public school that was built, Elmer A. Henderson: A Johns Hopkins Partnership School, to allocate more spots to children of color in nearby areas.\nTags:\nmagazine, trending, advocacy\nRelated Articles\nBy THE EDITORIAL BOARD\n| December 7, 2023\nProfessors of political science discuss Israel-Hamas conflict\nBy ZACHARY BAHAR\n| December 6, 2023\nFor my grandfather: A memoriam for the living\nBy KAITLIN TAN\n| December 6, 2023\nEditor's Picks\nProfessors of political science discuss Israel-Hamas conflict\nFor my grandfather: A memoriam for the living\nThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes capitalizes on moral shades of gray\nDanny Brown's Quaranta turns a midlife crisis into music\nI’m scared of the butterfly effect\nWeekly Rundown\nEvents this winter\nScience news in review: Dec. 3\nTo watch and watch for: Week of Dec. 3\nScience news in review: Nov. 13\nTweets by jhunewsletter\nPodcast\nMultimedia\nA year in review\nLeisure Interactive Food Map\nThe News-Letter Print Locations\nNews-Letter Special Editions\nNews\nOpinion\nVoices\nArts\nScitech\nSports\nLeisure\nMultimedia\nMagazine\nArchives\nAll Rights Reserved\n© Copyright 2019 The Johns Hopkins News-Letter\nPowered by Solutions by The State News\nPublished by the Students of Johns Hopkins since 1896"

Banks and her children became homeless almost overnight. With nowhere else to go, they spent months sleeping in her aging Ford Explorer. Roughly five years later, the house remains standing, and plans to redevelop west Baltimore’s Poppleton neighborhood have largely stalled, even after the city displaced Banks and many of her neighbors.Banks filed a complaint Monday asking federal officials to investigate whether Baltimore’s redevelopment policies are perpetuating racial segregation and violating fair housing laws by disproportionately displacing Black and low-income residents. Her experience presents the latest example of Black Baltimoreans losing their homes to redevelopment after watching their neighborhoods suffer from growing disinvestment — while whiter, more affluent communities flourish, Banks and her attorneys argue.\nOther news\nNYC mayor vetoes bill expanding reporting of police stops, faces override by City Council\nNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn’t happen this week\nMelania Trump remembers her mother as ‘a ray of light in the darkest days’\nOnce relatively common in American cities, using the practice for revitalization and infrastructure projects has largely fallen out of favor. Some cities are currently working to provide reparations to Black residents, acknowledging the harm caused by urban renewal efforts and other discriminatory practices. Banks reminisced about her children swimming in Poppleton’s public pool while she socialized with neighbors on their stoops. Since then, over 100 occupied homes have been seized, according to the complaint. The pool and nearby recreation center closed years ago, Banks said. Poppleton is about 93% Black, according to 2020 census data.“Baltimore has long been a tale of two cities,” said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which joined Banks in filing the complaint and organized a news conference Monday in Poppleton. In 1910, Baltimore leaders enacted the country’s first residential segregation ordinance that restricted African American homeowners to certain blocks. In addition to redlining, Poppleton residents experienced “slum clearance” starting in the 1930s with construction of Poe Homes, a public housing complex named after a nearby onetime residence of the famous poet Edgar Allan Poe. The number of displaced Black families was larger than the number of housing units created, according to the complaint.\nThen came Baltimore’s so-called “Highway To Nowhere,” which was designed to connect the downtown business district to interstates surrounding the city. Officials used eminent domain to demolish nearly 1,000 homes in the 1960s and ’70s, cutting a swath through majority-Black west Baltimore and severing ties between Poppleton and other nearby communities.Construction of the thoroughfare was never finished — partly because residents in more affluent neighborhoods successfully campaigned against it — and the endeavor became largely pointless. “What’s happening now in Poppleton is a reflection of what has happened before, part of an unbroken chain of policies and practices,” said Lawrence Brown, a research scientist at Morgan State University. “There is a pattern.”Plans for Poppleton’s urban renewal surfaced in the 1970s. By that time, Brown said, the neighborhood had already been experiencing mistreatment and disinvestment for decades. In 2006, city officials signed an agreement with a New York-based company, La Cite Development. Construction has been completed on two mixed-use buildings with 262 rental units, but many other aspects of the $800 million project haven’t materialized. Initial plans identified over 500 properties the company would redevelop near a University of Maryland biomedical research park, just outside the downtown business district.\nThe Associated Press\nap.org\nCareers\nAdvertise with us\nContact Us\nAccessibility Statement\nCookie Settings\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nMore From AP News\nAbout\nAP News Values and Principles\nAP’s Role in Elections\nAP Leads\nAP Definitive Source Blog\nAP Images Spotlight Blog\nAP Stylebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nfacebook"
