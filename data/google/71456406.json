There are many reasons. ByJean-Philippe Lefief Published on January 16, 2023, at 11:50 am (Paris), updated on January 16, 2023, at 12:14 pm Time to 4 min. Lire en français Share Share Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Linkedin Copy link Ukrainian rocket fire on Russian positions near Soledar, Donetsk region, Ukraine, January 11, 2023. LIBKOS / AP In eastern Ukraine, the small city of Soledar, which Russian mercenaries of the Wagner group claimed control of on January 10, has become a priority of Russian forces. The Russian army is now concentrating its best troops as well as significant material resources there, which were previously focused on Bakhmut, 10 kilometers further south on the front line. On January 13, Russia claimed it had seized Soledar after fierce fighting had taken place. The spokesman for the eastern command of the Ukrainian army dismissed the claim, saying the city was still under Ukrainian control. But the Ukrainian forces did admit to being in great difficulty as Russian forces seemed determined to take the city at all costs including heavy human losses. Why did this modest, now-razed city, which had barely 11,000 inhabitants before the conflict began, become so important in the eyes of Moscow's strategists and Wagner's senior soldiers? \"Everything is completely destroyed. There is almost no life left. What is Russia trying to gain there?\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked last week. Following a series of defeats, including in the Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts, the Russian army was obviously seeking to snatch a victory, even a modest one. It had been trying to seize Bakhmut for six months but Ukrainian forces defended it so fiercely that it had to fall back on Soledar. Yet, beyond the symbol, the small and seemingly insignificant city could play a key role in the continuation of the war for geographical, strategic, tactical and even commercial and political reasons.

Its objective is no longer to bring down Kyiv but to avoid humiliation by at least completing the conquest of the highly industrialized region of Donbas. The Donetsk coal basin consists of the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. There, Russia recognized the independence of the \"people's republics\" unilaterally proclaimed by pro-Russian separatists as early as 2014 before annexing them in September last year. Partner service Learn French with Gymglish Thanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day. Try for free While Russian forces and local separatists have held nearly all of Luhansk oblast since the summer, the Ukrainian army has retaken much of Donetsk oblast, which includes Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two towns with over 100,000 inhabitants. Conquering Soledar would not only allow the Russians to tighten the siege of Bakhmut but also cut off the supply lines of the Ukrainian forces defending it. Ukrainian forces are under fire from Russian artillery which could precipitate the city's fall. Once the Bakhmut-Soledar lock is broken, the road to Sloviansk opens, via Kostiantynivka, Druzhkivka and Kramatorsk from the west, or via Siversk from the north. Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés A day in the life of a Ukrainian unit under attack in the slag heaps of Donbas A military, commercial and political objective Soledar is important not just because of its geographical location. The city owes its name to a now abandoned salt mine that offers great protection to fighters and their equipment. Its 200-kilometers-long tunnels run under the front line, which would enable the Russians to infiltrate behind Ukrainian lines. For Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner Group, the mine would also be of commercial interest as would the gypsum deposits in the area. The businessman, who has already instructed his mercenaries to seize mining sites in Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali in order to exploit them for his own benefit, said on Monday that the Soledar mine would come as \"the cherry on the cake.\" This \"network of underground cities\" located at a depth of around 100 meters and where, according to Mr. Prigozhin, a large number of weapons from the First World War are believed to be stored, constitutes a \"unique and historic defense,\" he said earlier this month. Politically, taking possession of the mine would finally allow him to claim what the Russian military has been vainly seeking and score a crucial point in its struggle for influence with the Sergei Shoigu-Valery Gerasimov duo, minister of defense and chief of staff, who are losing support after numerous military setbacks. But Mr. Gerasimov has just been appointed in charge of the troops deployed in Ukraine, in a sign that he has not completely lost all credibility. Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés The political ambitions of Russia's Wagner Group boss 'Fixing' Ukrainian forces, an increasingly pressing imperative Mr. Prigozhin was so determined to succeed that he did not hesitate to sacrifice his men in large numbers. \"After a failed attempt to conquer Soledar, the enemy withdrew, regrouped, replenished and changed its tactics to launch a new large-scale assault,\" Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said. From now on, she added, \"the enemy is literally marching on the bodies of its own soldiers.\" Like the battalions of refuseniks, conscientious objectors, used by the Red Army as cannon fodder during the Second World War, the assault troops are believed to be made up of common law prisoners pardoned in exchange for their commitment to the militia, and whose life expectancy is very low. Wagner's mercenaries are forcing the Ukrainian army to maintain large numbers of troops and equipment in Bakhmut and Soledar. As a result, Ukrainian forces are unable to take initiative on other fronts, as they are fully busy with defending the Soledar area, which is eminently strategic for the fate of Donbas. Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés War in Ukraine: 'We're seeing the 21st-century version of the battle of Verdun' Like the Battle of Verdun in France in 1916, the battle brought the conflict back to the trench warfare seen this summer before the counter-offensives led by Ukraine in Kharkiv and Kherson. \"The situation around Soledar and Bakhmut forces our command to employ more resources there, so there may not be enough to conduct a major offensive in the south from Zaporizhia or elsewhere,\" Igor Levchenko, head of strategic modeling with Ukrainian think tank New Geopolitics, said. \"Fixing\" the Ukrainian army in this way has become particularly important for Moscow as Kyiv awaits the arrival of lightly armored vehicles recently promised by France, the United States and Germany. These weapons could allow for new impetus in the reconquest of occupied territories. A decisive battle? With Wagner's new tactics, the fighting in the area has certainly changed, but it has been going on since the summer, which has allowed Ukrainian forces to deploy an impressive defensive system around the city that the Russians will have a hard time breaking, even if both cities ultimately fall. According to Vincent Tourret, a member of the French Foundation for Strategic Research think tank and a Russian army specialist, \"the capture of Bakhmut will not lead to a Ukrainian collapse.\" \"The Kyiv army's defense lines are well organized in this region and the Russians no longer have enough maneuvering capacity there,\" he told Le Monde on January 10. However, the gradual arrival of conscripts mobilized by Russia in September could increase leeway. Kyiv and its allies also suspect that Moscow is preparing a new large-scale mobilization that could, this time, radically change the situation on the ground.

The town is relatively small, with a pre-war population of just 10,000, and its strategic significance is debatable. But if it is confirmed that Russian forces have seized control of it, then there will likely be a big sigh of relief in the Kremlin.Divisions have emerged between regular Russian forces and the notorious Russian Wagner paramilitary group throughout the battle, with a jealous turf-war developing over who should take credit for the advance. Barely any walls in Soledar remain standing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said this week. Describing almost apocalyptic scenes, he spoke of the nearby terrain as scarred by missile strikes and littered with Russian corpses.Speaking during his nightly address from Kyiv on Friday, Mr Zelensky said the battle in the region continued to rage, but avoided any reference to Russia's claims of control over Soledar. \"Although the enemy has concentrated its greatest forces in this direction, our troops - the Armed Forces of Ukraine, all defence and security forces - are defending the state,\" the Ukrainian leader said. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, compared the fight for Soledar and Bakhmut to one of the bitterest battles of World War One, at Verdun.Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday that 559 civilians including 15 children remained in Soledar and could not be moved out. Satellite images show Soledar devastationWhat is Russia's Wagner Group in Ukraine?Russia-supporting Wagner Group mercenary numbers soarThe town's significance for the Russian military is disputed by military analysts because of its relatively small size. The US-based think tank Institute for the Study of War said while it was likely that Russian forces had captured Soledar, it did not believe they would then be able to go on to encircle Bakhmut.Nevertheless, if it becomes clear that Russia has taken it, then that will be seen in Moscow as progress - even a victory. That is exactly what President Vladimir Putin needs as Russia has failed to capture a single town in Ukraine since July 2022. Since then, Moscow's forces have suffered a whole series of embarrassing defeats. Ukraine's successful counter-attack pushed Russia almost completely out of Kharkiv region in the north-east. In October, Russia's Kerch bridge came under attack, with Russian forces retreating from the city of Kherson the following month. The southern port city had been the only regional capital that Russia had managed to seize since the invasion began. Capturing Soledar would be something for Moscow to present as some \"good news\" to the Russian people and the troops on the wintry front line.But Serhiy Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern military command, denied Soledar was in Russian hands: \"We won't give any more details as we do not want to reveal the tactical positions of our fighters.\"Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Malyar, said fighting had been \"hot in Soledar overnight\". Ukrainian fighters were \"bravely trying to hold the defence\", she added, in what was a difficult stage of the war.Western and Ukrainian officials have said much of the fighting in Soledar and Bakhmut is being done by the notoriously brutal Wagner mercenary group. ReutersUkraine this week cast doubt on a photo claiming to show Yevgeny Prigozhin inside a Soledar salt mineIts leader, 61-year-old Yevgeny Prigozhin, has claimed repeatedly over the past few days that his forces are the only units on the ground in Soledar. He said on Tuesday night that his mercenaries had seized the town, only to be contradicted by Russia's defence ministry the next morning. Daily updates from the Russian defence ministry have made no mention whatsoever of Wagner, and Friday's briefing was no exception. The military said that paratroopers had played a key part in the capture of the town. Mr Prigozhin then released a statement saying he was \"surprised\" to read the defence ministry briefing. There \"wasn't a single paratrooper\" in Soledar, he insisted, warning against \"insulting fighters\" and \"stealing others' achievements\".And on Friday evening, Mr Prigozhin accused \"officials who want to stay in their places\" of being the biggest threat to his group's advance in Ukraine. In a later statement, the defence ministry praised the mercenaries' \"courageous and selfless actions\" during the fighting, but again emphasised the leading role of regular Russian forces. Analysts have long spoken of tensions between the military and Mr Prigozhin's Wagner group. The Russian oligarch has publicly criticised senior military leaders, including Gen Valery Gerasimov, appointed two days ago as overall commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. While Russia has mobilised some 300,000 reservists for the war since the end of September, Prigozhin has looked to recruit extra numbers from Russia's prisons. Andriy Yermak told French daily Le Monde that Russian criminals had been sent straight to their deaths on the front line: \"Soledar is a scene of street battles, with neither side really in control of the town.\"HomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureTravelEarthVideoLiveBBC ShopBBC in other languagesTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usAdChoices/ Do Not Sell My InfoCopyright 2024 BBC.

Russian mercenaries and regular troops suffered immense casualties, which could dramatically impact what each does next, say military observers.Apparent victory in salt-mining town comes at a high cost for RussiaChris Brown · CBC News · Posted: Jan 16, 2023 4:00 AM EST | Last Updated: January 16, 2023A Ukrainian army artillery brigade fires a howitzer near Soledar, Ukraine, on Jan. 11. (Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)Social SharingIn recent days, the town of Soledar has become Ukraine's latest killing field.Russian forces appear to have finally taken control of at least most of thepractically annihilated community in the eastern Donbas region —but not before Ukraine's army exacted a heavy toll.Both sides have made frequent and unverifiable claims of inflicting heavy casualties on the other,but Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar described the situation in especially harrowing detail.\"The enemy literally steps on the corpses of his own soldiers, massively uses artillery, volley fire systems and mortars, covering even its own soldiers with fire,\" she wrote on social media.With unverifiableestimates from the Ukrainian side putting Russian losses over the past few weeks in the thousands of wounded or killed,the cost ofcapturingSoledarhas been catastrophic for Russia,said Oleksiy Melnyk,a former Ukrainian Air Force lieutenant colonel who's now with the Razumkov Centre, a Kyiv-basedthink-tank.Smoke rises from strikes on the Ukrainian town of Soledar on Jan. 5. (Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters)\"The Ukrainian military command are trying to prevent the other from conducting another offensive operation,\" Melnyk said.Before Soledar became a battlefield objective,it was best known for being the site of a vast complex of tunnels used for mining salt.People in military uniform, purportedly from the Russian mercenary group Wagner, pose for a picture believed to be in a salt mine in Soledar in the Donetsk region of Ukraine, in this handout picture released Jan. 10. (Press service of Concord/Reuters)Fanning out from the town for hundreds of kilometres underground, parts of the salt tunnel maze are accessible to the public, creating an unusual local tourist attraction.Russia's primary target since the summer had been the nearby city of Bakhmut,roughly 10 kilometres away.But in late December, Russian mercenary forces from the Wagner Group —which had been spearheading the long, grinding head-on assault —instead turned their attack to the north and made Soledar the focus.Melynk says the Wagner forces, which are controlled and paid for by Russian business tycoon Yevgeny Prigozhin,were determined to getPresident Vladimir Putin a victory no matter what the cost, to strengthen Prigozhin's influence with the Kremlin, and to embarrass rival commanders in Russia's Defence Ministry.Taking excessive casualties was not a consideration, he said.\"We see how the Russians treat their mobilized men —they are not people,\" said Melnyk.Oleksiy Melnyk, a former Ukrainian Air Force lieutenant colonel, is with the Kyiv-based think-tank Razumkov Centre. He says the Wagner Group is paid for by a Russian business tycoon. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)In September, Russia activated roughly 300,000 soldiers, most of whom are believed to have had some previous military experience, and sent roughly halfimmediately to Ukraine.The rest were held in reserve and given more training.Melnyk says Ukraine's Defence Ministry expects Russia is preparing to send the remaining mobilizedsoldiers to the front, intending to restart offensive operations in Donbas after a succession of high-profile defeats in the fall and summer.The re-appointment this week of Valery Gerasimov, Russia's top general and one of the key planners of last year's Feb. 24invasion, as the senior commander in Ukraine is being seen as another sign that Russia is planning to forge ahead.At the same time,Ukraine's forces have also been re-equipping and bolstering their divisions with modern Western-made equipment in anticipation of mounting their own counteroffensive.Russia's recent losses in Bakhmut may force its commanders to redeploy troops from other areas,opening up possibilities for Ukraine to resume its attacks to regain Russian-occupied territory.A satellite view shows destroyed buildings in Soledar on Jan. 10. (Maxar Technologies/Reuters)That's roughly the same tactic Ukrainian generals followed in the summer and fall,when Russia captured the Donbas city of Severodonetsk but at such a high cost that its army was unable to hold thousands of square kilometres of territory in Kharkiv and Khersonoblasts.Melnyk says he expects the Ukrainian strategists are thinking similarly now.\"There are two different and simultaneous preparations on the front lines (northern and southern regions), and where the most favourable conditions occurred,then that will be the real (offensive).\"Nick Reynoldsof the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has been closely studying Russia's troop deployments, but he says it's not possible to know whether its newly mobilized troops will have enough training and equipment to go on the offensive.\"It's unlikely they could do that in great strength,\" he told CBC News in an interview.\"I think we're more talking about units that can hold the line or push forward incrementally.\"A tank fires a round in Soledar in this screen grab released on Jan. 8 and obtained from a social media video by Reuters on Jan. 10. (State Border Guard Service Of Ukraine/Reuters)Kyvi-based military analyst Oleh Zhdanov,a colonel in Ukraine's Air Force reserves,also doubts the introduction of Russia's mobilized recruits will be enough for its army to regain the initiative.\"They don't have time for proper preparation and modern armaments, and with every new wave of conscripts, the quality of the conscripts and the quality of the equipment will fall,\"Zhdanov told CBC News.He sees the real value for the Kremlin in taking Soledar as mostly political,in that Russian propaganda outlets will use it to rally people to support the war —and to discourage reticent Western nations from sending weapons to Ukraine.Inside the 'meat grinder': Russian and Ukrainian losses mount in Bakhmut\"They will say to the West that tomorrow we are ready to take Kyiv,\"said Zhdanov.Reynolds,the RUSI analyst, said whereas he was unsure before,he now believes the advanced air defence systems provided by Western nations over the last month,including NASAMSand Patriot defence systems,indicate Western countries are prepared to keep helping Ukraine over the long term,which will prevent the conflict from turning into a stalemate.\"The Ukrainians are winning,\" he said.On Saturday,the U.K. announced it would send 12modern Challenger 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, and Poland has said it intends to send German-made Leopard 2 tanks —if the German government consents and agrees to send its own Leopards.Ukraine says it needs hundreds of Western tanks if it is to take back all of the territory Russia has occupied since annexing Crimea in 2014.Nonetheless,the attempt to hold Soledar and the relentless trench warfare in Bakhmut has been costly for Ukraine, too.The Ukrainian government rarely discusses its casualty numbers, but Zhdanov, the Ukrainian military analyst,says dozens are dying around Bakhmut every day.\"I would say (the ratio of deaths) is one to eight,or one to 10,\" he told CBC News, which works out to roughly 50 or 60 Ukrainian combat deaths a day for every 500 or 600 Russians.The latest United Nations estimate of civilian deaths in the war is now over three months old and likely severely undercounts the casualties.The UN has said at least 6,100 Ukrainian civilians have died,but Zhdanov says he believes the real toll from Russia's constant aerial and missile bombardment of Ukrainian cities is likely more than 10 times that.ABOUT THE AUTHORChris BrownForeign CorrespondentChris Brown is a foreign correspondent based in the CBC’s London bureau.
