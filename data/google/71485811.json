Yet from the start of 'The Strangers' it's clear that this film is a different. In today's bloodthirsty society, horror films are often reduced to nothing more than gore-filled gross-out fests. While many young teens may rejoice at such films, many of us still long for original, suspenseful, and, yes, terrifying horror movies. 'The Strangers' came so close.There is plenty here to recommend: Director Bryan Bertino shows himself to be a patient and smart director. Rather than going for just cheap thrills, he wisely builds tension up to near-breaking point. The feeling of suspense and dread that covers the whole film is classic. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror... yet that's where the film loses some of its commendation. The strangers at times seem that they can't possibly be human because they are made to be almost supernatural in their abilities. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly- a power the young couple probably wished they had but don't because they are, after all, HUMANS. It's a simple mistake used to give the audience one of those cheap thrills that were otherwise so wisely avoided. What makes it sad is that in every other aspect, 'The Strangers' is chillingly realistic and terrifyingly possible. Every time those strangers come and go like ghosts of some kind, it makes the audience sit back once more and say, 'Ah, well, it's just a movie.\" That's too bad.Still, 'The Strangers' is much better than your average horror fare. It's at last a new movie that realizes what you don't show can be even more scary than what you do. Still, one hopes that Mr. Bertino can touch up the mistakes from this film and , and deliver a really great horror movie next time around. 7/10 stars!

        "text": "Show Menu\nBy Alex Wiggan\nImage: ©Lionsgate\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\n__\nThe Strangers movies\nImage: ©Universal Pictures\nThe Strangers (2008)\nAs noted above, the first entry in The Strangers movie series arrived in 2008. The film focused on James Hoyt and Kristen McKay, and their night of terror at the hands of masked strangers, Dollface, Man in the Mask, and Pin-Up Girl.\nIn the movie, James and Kristen arrive at their remote property late at night, after attending a friend’s wedding. There is tension between the couple, but nothing out of the ordinary.\nShortly after 4 am, there is a knock at the door. When James opens the door, a young blonde woman is standing outside.\nThe woman asks if her friend is at the house. When James tells the woman she is at the wrong house, she leaves.\nA shortwhile later, three masked strangers arrive at the house. They break inside and take great pleasure in frightening, terrorising, and assaulting James and Kristen.\nThe Strangers: Prey at Night (2018)\nAlthough The Strangers was a hit with audiences, and plans were quickly put in place for a sequel to begin filming soon after the release of the movie, the project took longer than expected. The follow-up went through a troubled development, and didn’t make its debut until 2018 – ten years after the release of the first instalment.\nThis delayed sequel was titled The Strangers: Prey at Night, and picked up the story in real-time, a decade after the events of its predecessor. In this instalment, Dollface, Man in the Mask, and Pin-Up Girl terrorise a family who are vacationing at a remote trailer park.\nThe Strangers: Chapter 1 (2024)\nFollowing the release of The Strangers: Prey at Night, The Strangers movie series went on hiatus. When it was revived, a decision was made to push forward in a slightly new direction with not one, but three new movies!\nThe films would form a new trio of tales, that would act as a stand-alone trilogy to the previous instalments. The first of these films would be The Strangers: Chapter 1.\nIn this movie, young couple Maya and Ryan travel across country to start a new life together. Along the way, their car breaks down and this forces them to spend a night at an isolated Airbnb.\nShortly after arriving at the property, the couple are terrorised by three masked strangers.\nThe Strangers: Chapter 2 (2024)\nContinuing the story established in The Strangers: Chapter 1, The Strangers: Chapter 2 explores the horrors enacted by the strangers.\nThe Strangers: Chapter 3 (2024)\nDevised as the final entry in the trilogy, The Strangers: Chapter 3 is a direct sequel to Chapters 1 and 2, and concludes the story.\nImage: ©Aviron Pictures/Vertigo Releasing\nAdvertisements\nPlease note: While The Strangers movies are all loosely connected, technically the films can be viewed as two entities:\nThe original collection\nThe trilogy\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nBryan Bertino directed The Strangers\nJohannes Roberts directed The Strangers: Prey at Night\nRenny Harlin directed The Strangers: Chapter 1, The Strangers: Chapter 2, and The Strangers: Chapter 3\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nAdvertisements\nShare this:TwitterFacebookMoreLinkedInRedditTumblrPinterestLike Loading...\nPublished on\nJanuary 5, 2024\nTags: Film, Films, Horror, Horror movies, How many The Strangers movies are there?, Movie, Movies, Slashers, The Strangers, The Strangers Chapter 1, The Strangers Chapter 2, The Strangers Chapter 3, The Strangers Prey at Night, Thriller, What is the order of The Strangers movies?\nCategories: Films, Halloween, Horror\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nΔ\nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

While the series did garner a 2018 sequel, The Strangers: Prey By Night, it never quite spawned the franchise you might expect from a hit horror movie. But director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Exorcist: The Beginning) and Lionsgate are here to fix that with a trilogy of new Strangers movies inspired by the originals.\nHarlin provided new details on the trilogy of movies during a panel at New York Comic Con 2023 where he also showed fans some frightening early footage from the trio of movies.\nWhile we don’t know the full story of the trilogy, Lionsgate does have a description for the first chapter:\nMadelaine Petsch (TV’s Riverdale) stars as a young woman starting a new life with her fiancé. Suddenly, during a road trip stop in a remote vacation rental in the woods, they become the prey of a mysterious gang of masked strangers who attack without warning or reason.\nIt’s a premise that should be instantly recognizable to fans of the original movie or its sequel, but what’s even more interesting is how this movie was made.\nPhoto: John Armour/Lionsgate\nIn This Stream\nAll the NYCC 2023 news, trailers, and reveals in one place\nJudging by the NYCC Percy Jackson panel, the show is going to rule\nThe Strangers is getting a trilogy of new movies from the director of Die Hard 2\nNYCC gives us a look at a few clones in Orphan Black: Echoes\nView all 12 stories\nNext Up In\nHorror\nThe next level of puzzles.\nTake a break from your day by playing a puzzle or two!
