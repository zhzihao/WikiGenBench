If you lose control of the board and it hits someone else, they will certainly feel it in the morning.\n2. Scuba Diving\nThe deep blue is a relatively unexplored region of the world. In fact, we know more about the moon than we do our own ocean! Thankfully, scuba diving is a lot cheaper, and a lot less dangerous, than a trip to the moon.\nTop Tip: Remember to warm up properly before making any heroic dives. Like beach soccer, volleyball plays havoc on the ankles so be careful.\n5. Body Surfing\nThere couldn't be anything more natural than riding waves without any boards or motorised gadgets. All you need is a bathing suit that won't come off in the ocean and waves. Swimming yourself into them can be tricky at first, but once you've bagged yourself a few decent rides it'll feel like you've been doing it your whole life. There are three main methods to riding waves:\nThe Windmill: Place one arm out in front of you, while using the other to keep stroking\nThe Handcuffs: Place your arms out straight in front of you and keep your wrists tightly together (like they are handcuffed together)\nThe Bullet: Ideal for those with little to no hair. Keep your arms tightly held against your side and 'steer' with your head\nFor more information about this fine sport, plus group discussions and more, check out: www.body-surfing.co.uk\nTop Tip: Body surfing is pretty safe, provided you are swimming at a public beach where life guards are present.\n6. Water-skiing and Wake-boarding\nWater-skiing and wake-boarding are basically the summer equivalent of the snow variety - the key difference is the boat and the temperature outside. The boat pulls you along as you glide across the water at high speed, making S-turns across the surface. Like most adrenaline fuelled sports, it's really addictive and very tiring, so you'll probably feel like you've been kicked by a mule after day one, but you'll be even hungrier to master the tricks you started trying.\nFor more information on the UK Water ski and Wake-boarding scene see britishwaterski.org.uk\nTop Tip: You don't need a license to go skiing or wake-boarding, but you will need a permit to drive the boat. Be careful when skiing: you need a life jacket, a red flag to indicate 'skier down'. Always be aware of what is around you, too.\nHoliday ExtrasAirport ParkingAirport HotelsAirport LoungesTravel InsuranceInsurance for pre existing medical conditionsCar HireAirport TransfersAirports by RailTravel MoneyAirport TaxiFast TrackUK BreaksTop airport parking locationsGatwick ParkingHeathrow ParkingStansted ParkingLuton Airport ParkingManchester Airport ParkingBirmingham Airport ParkingCardiff Airport ParkingLiverpool Airport ParkingGlasgow Airport ParkingBristol Airport ParkingEdinburgh Airport ParkingNewcastle Airport ParkingTop airport hotel locationsGatwick HotelsHeathrow HotelsStansted HotelsLuton Airport HotelsManchester Airport HotelsBirmingham Airport HotelsCardiff Airport HotelsLiverpool Airport HotelsGlasgow Airport HotelsBristol Airport HotelsEdinburgh Airport HotelsNewcastle Airport HotelsLess hassle.
