I haven't laughed out loud at a TV show in a long time, but this one had me in stitches start to finish. Kudos to Danny McBride as a writer, producer, actor and in this episode - director. Just brilliant!And in fairness, Walton Goggins was equally brilliant. The episode would have not been nearly as entertaining with any other actor playing his role.

As the high school students look on shocked, the teachers behave like melodramatic teenagers, turning their emotions up to 11, gloriously overacting. When Vice Principals plays its teachers like the cast of exaggerated ‘80s teen movie, it toes the line perfectly between ridiculous comedy and heightened drama. Fortunately, this scene is topped soon after when Gamby and Russell begin fighting through the halls of North Jackson. Utilizing tracking shots and some long-take steady cams, Danny McBride, stepping behind the camera as the episode’s director, turns the hilariously over-the-top beatdown into a display of camera wizardry by the time Gamby is being escorted out of the school.\nUnwilling to let Russell beat him, Gamby hatches a plan to confront Russell at the prom. It’s the perfect setting for the climax of this overwrought episode. Using a diary of childhood secrets, Gamby threatens Russell a final time, and it sticks. Gamby gets a well-earned victory, then slow dances with Snodgrass as the two share a sentimental kiss. With a pulsing ‘80s groove propelling the moment, Gamby’s good conquering evil moment feels like the end of a Nicolas Winding Refn movie. However, a lingering shot on a jealous Ms. Abbott gives credence to my speculation that Abbott planted the evidence in Russell’s Jeep and that she’s the real shooter. I’m sure we’ll know for certain next week.\nSeason 2 of Vice Principals has been a vast improvement overall, but it hasn’t been more apparent than in this episode. Expertly paced, tense yet silly, and impressively stylized, episodes like this will make me Vice Principals dearly once it concludes next week. With likely one more battle left in the war between VPs, I’m certain Vice Principals will go out with quite a large bang.\nAd\n5 out of 5\nShare:Share on Facebook (opens in a new tab)Share on Twitter (opens in a new tab)Share on Linkedin (opens in a new tab)Share on email (opens in a new tab) | Comment:\nComments count:0\nTags: ComedyHBOVice Principals\nWritten by\nNick Harley |\n@mick_marley\nNick Harley is an entertainment journalist and alumnus of Ohio University's E.W.
