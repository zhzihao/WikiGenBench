The Eustachian tube connects the throat with the tympanic cavity and provides passage for gas when pressure equalization is needed. This equalization normally occurs with little or no effort. Various maneuvers, such as swallowing or yawning, can facilitate the process.\nAn obstruction in the Eustachian tube can lead to an inability to achieve equalization, particularly during descent, when the pressure changes quickly. If the pressure in the tympanic cavity is lower than the pressure of the surrounding tissue, this imbalance results in negative pressure (a relative vacuum) in the middle-ear space. It causes tissue to swell, the eardrum to bulge inward, leakage of fluid and bleeding of ruptured vessels. At a certain point an active attempt to equalize will be futile, and a forceful Valsalva maneuver may injure the inner ear. Eventually the eardrum may rupture; this is likely to bring relief from the pain associated with MEBT, but it is an outcome to avoid if possible.\nOften the injury is serious enough that it causes rupture of the eardrum, tympanic membrane rupture or inner ear barotrauma.\nFactors that can contribute to the development of MEBT include the common cold, allergies or inflammation — conditions that can cause swelling and may block the Eustachian tubes. Poor equalization techniques or too rapid descent may also contribute to the development of MEBT.\nManifestations\nDivers who cannot equalize middle-ear pressure during descent will first feel discomfort in their ears (clogged or stuffed ears) that may progress to severe pain. Further descent only intensifies the ear pain, which is soon followed by a serous fluid buildup and bleeding in the middle ear. With further descent, the eardrum may rupture, providing pain relief; this rupture may cause vertigo and hearing loss. Exposure of the normally sterile middle ear to infection from a mixture of pathogens from the non-sterile contents of the ear canal and surrounding water may result in a middle-ear infection.\nSigns and Symptoms\nA feeling of clogged or stuffed ears\nEar discomfort or pain\nPain increases with descent during diving\nFluid buildup and bleeding\nEardrum rupture, leading to vertigo and hearing loss\nPrevention\nFirst Aid\nImplications for Diving\nPost navigation\nCoral Scrapes and CutsMiddle-Ear Equalization\nHome Site Map Policies Terms & Conditions Advertise Contact Us\n© DAN, Inc.
