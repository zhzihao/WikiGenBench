On September 26, 1983 a Soviet officer, Stanislav Petrov, disobeyed orders and declined to relay information on what appeared, on Russian radar, to be five incoming missiles from the U.S. to his superiors. As depicted in the show, the \"missiles\" turned out to be reflections from a cloud. Had he disclosed the radar sightings it might have led to a nuclear war, as depicted in \"The Day After.\" Petrov's actions did not become public until many years later. The incident is dramatized in the 2014 movie, The Man Who Saved the World (2014). This was not the first time nuclear war was avoided. During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, an Admiral aboard a Soviet sub ordered the captain to launch his nuclear missile. The captain, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov, who had been appointed the commander of the submarine group involved, refused to do so.GoofsThe VCR that Elizabeth uses in Yung Hee's home has the VHS HQ brand. HQ was invented by JVC in 1985. That is two years after the events portrayed here.ConnectionsFeatures The Day After (1983)SoundtracksWinter Kills(uncredited)Written by Alison MoyetPerformed by YazooUser reviews3ReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 Well depicted conflicts of conscience, bad music blasting ruins moodThe series has almost always depicted people being torn between what they believe is right and what they're SUPPOSED to believe is right. This episode puts less weight on the sneaky-spy-business and characters otherwise depicted as cold blooded patriots also become torn by thinking of the possible consequences if someone uses the weapon they're trying to obtain. When Paige starts asking questions about a possible apocalyptic war the protagonists also have to ask themselves what their children will think of them. There isn't much else to say about this episode, the internal and interpersonal conflicts are gripping and realistic. However many scenes are ruined by bad music blasting in the background, often just as loud as the conversations. This breaks the tension in otherwise gripping scenes. The music doesn't enhance the mood of the scenes, it just seems like random 70:s and 80:s music from someone's old CD collection.helpful•616heaan-lasaiMay 15, 2016Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMay 11, 2016 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishRussianKoreanFilming locationsRye Playland, Rye, New York, USA(Where Paige gets her driving lesson)See more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime46 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

Read our complete coverage of the show here. Spoilers, needless to say, follow.\nOn the history of The Day After\nWith special guest star John Cullum.\nFX\nIn their infinite wisdom, The Americans' PR people have given us, like, 500 photos of Stan and Philip playing squash. Here is just one of them.\nFX\nLibby Nelson: After the incredibly tense run of episodes we've just been through, I don’t mind taking a breath for a second.\nAnd I thought \"The Day After\" was nicely done. While The Americans boasts a scrupulous commitment to period detail, it doesn’t tend to hang big plot twists on news events in the way that, say, Mad Men did; that prevents the occasional exception from feeling too gimmicky.\nBut the episode did have the unfortunate side effect of recasting the time jump as something the series did mostly because it needed to get to November 20, 1983, when \"The Day After\" aired. I don’t mind the leap, and I realize the point of it was to give Philip and Elizabeth some peace and quiet. But the result is that it doesn’t feel like much happened at all in the interim.\nGiven how little time has elapsed in the Jennings’ world over the past two seasons — remember, before the time jump, it had only been a couple of weeks since Paige and Elizabeth returned from Germany — seven months is a lot, and I expected to see a few more hints of how things might have changed in the meantime.\nThe final moments of \"The Day After\" made up for all that, though. I’d been confused as to what, exactly, Elizabeth’s endgame with Young Hee was. (I’ll admit that I’m still a little confused. I assume it involves blackmail?) That’s the most shaken up we’ve ever seen Elizabeth because of an operation, and I’m curious about what you both think about how it played out.\nTodd: That Elizabeth has mostly become friends with Young Hee in order to get to her husband, Don, is kind of sad in and of itself — Elizabeth is making a very good friend of someone she knows will have to become collateral damage.\nBut the fact that Elizabeth ultimately ​didn't sleep with Don will only make this harder to bear for her, I think. She'll have to act as if she's the horrible person she knows she is, whom Young Hee never suspected her of being, even though she technically only ​seems​ to have slept with Don (though drugging him is bad enough).\nThat's a tricky balance to pull off, and Keri Russell does a great job with it.\nLibby: I’m still a little confused by what Elizabeth was supposed to be accomplishing. Sleeping with Don (or pretending to sleep with Don) seems like a great way to blow up her friendship with Young Hee, but it doesn’t seem like it gets her any closer to what she needs from Fort Detrick.\nAlthough, if she uses Don's apparent infidelity to blackmail him to get what she needs by threatening to tell his wife, she’ll have to maintain her friendship with Young Hee to make the threat seem plausible, right?\nI’m so delighted by Young Hee and her family that I’ve mostly overlooked the fact that this plot can be a little hard to comprehend, but I think I’m missing something here.\nTodd: My guess is that Elizabeth will ask Don to help William get clearance in exchange for saying nothing to Young Hee and exiting both of their lives forever.\nBut the alternate scenario is that Don tells Young Hee, and the whole plan blows up, which is what I predict will happen.\nA season all about relationships\nElizabeth seems incredulous.\nFX\nCaroline: I agree with Libby; Young Hee’s role in all this has been hazy, I think mostly on purpose, but now that the operation is approaching its end, I realize just how little I knew/cared about her role.\nBut I also agree with Todd; there’s no way things will be this easy. The Soviets won't get Level 4 clearance because of blackmailing with one \"indiscretion.\" In fact, Philip and Elizabeth assuming as much feels uncharacteristically narrow of them.\nSure, they can usually depend on people’s fears to get sensitive information, but I’d assumed that given the incredibly dangerous work Don does on Level 4, he would be prepped in case of blackmail situations, and/or know better than to play fast and loose with that information.\nTodd: A lot of Young Hee's place in the overall operation has been predicated on the payoff, which is dangerous. But I think she's less important as a plot device than as a sign of Elizabeth's need to have someone to talk to — and a symbol of how willing Elizabeth is to sacrifice even a close friendship in the name of the cause.\nIn short, she's an escalation character. If Elizabeth is willing to betray Young Hee, what happens when it's Paige who needs to be \"dealt with\"?\nCaroline: Absolutely. Which is why now that Young Hee is important to the plot, I’ve completely lost sight of why she was part of the story in the first place.\nLibby: After years of seeing Philip develop his relationship with Martha and his friendship with Stan, I’m glad we got to see Elizabeth have a significant interaction with someone she isn’t related to — if only to refute accusations that her only mode is ferocious. (I’ve always thought Elizabeth was a fantastic, nuanced character, but comments from The Americans’ showrunners suggest that at least part of the audience views her as an unfeeling Soviet machine.)\nAnd if the bioweapons plot seems a little far-fetched (it does), it at least seems in service of a bigger theme: The cracks in the USSR are starting to show, driven home by Oleg’s comment about how only one man’s good judgment averted nuclear holocaust and William’s uncertainty over whether he should even mention the new, Ebola-like threat.\nBig-picture national politics haven’t been a major theme of The Americans, thankfully — even the previous Rezidentura storylines mostly concerned lower-level intrigue — but this season, between the acid commentary on the war in Afghanistan and the bioweapons plot, it’s becoming clear that something is rotten in Moscow.\nIt’s reminded me that, although Philip and Elizabeth might be loyal Soviet patriots, they’re very removed from the country itself; the USSR is represented almost solely by Gabriel. Philip and Elizabeth can’t necessarily see how much things are breaking down in the background.\nThe difference between nuclear and biological weapons\nPaige Jennings is not so sure about this nuclear war stuff.\nFX\nOne-Time\nMonthly\nAnnual\n$5/month\n$10/month\n$25/month\n$50/month\nOther\n$\nYes, I'll give $5/month\nYes, I'll give $5/month\nWe accept credit card, Apple Pay, and\nGoogle Pay.
