In this episode, the boy he goes home with is called Lee. This may explain why Zuko hesitates when Gansu asks his name instead of using the fake name he came up with earlier and will use again later.QuotesUrsa: Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect you. Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you are.ConnectionsFeatured in The Nostalgia Critic: Top 11 Best Avatars (2014)User reviews12ReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 One of my favorite episodesAvatar is one of my favorite shows, containing unparallelled maturity, humor, dealing with heavy subjects, and containing severalof the best character archs ever written.This episode is more of a standalone one off about Zuko drifting through a rural earth kingdom village (It's very reminiscent of old westerns).Zuko's interactions with common people and the reveal of his childhood/relationship with his mother was heartbreaking and explains alot. He's such a complex and interesting character, the voice acting and writing is excellent.Everything is perfect and ends about as tragically as you'd expect.helpful•721irishboy141Apr 16, 2020Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMay 12, 2006 (United States)LanguageEnglishSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime25 minutesRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentIMDb Answers: Help fill gaps in our dataLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to explorePhotosTop Stars to Watch in 2024See the galleryPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
