For disabled students, however, it is an entirely different ball game. Certainly, there are a number of colleges specifically for disabled students, such as Gallaudet University, which serves deaf and hard-of-hearing students; however, the majority of students with physical disabilities opt for immersion with their non-disabled peers when seeking a college education. In fact, statistics on disabled college students show that 11% of college students have a documented disability – and because of students who choose not to self-identify, the true number if probably far larger.\nWhat Can Disabled Students Do if They Face Discrimination in College?\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education ACT (IDEA) has very specific protections for students who have any disability in a federally funded school, from pre-K through 12th Grade. However, the laws exist, but are a little less clear as far as protections and accommodations go for disabled college students. State Funded Programs including higher education are covered by Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and vocational schools and private colleges offer protections to disabled students under the ADA Title III. Section 504 specifically relates to institutions that receive federal funding. These protections ensure that disabled students are given what they need to receive an equal education with access to “reasonable accommodations.” It is variable, however, how individual schools define accommodations that are “reasonable.”\nThis is the key reason why we felt it was important to create a list of schools that take accessibility seriously when considering the needs of disabled students. We wrote a previous ranking that focused on schools that provide excellent support for students with learning disabilities. While there is quite a bit of crossover, this list is geared more towards schools that provide excellent accommodations for students with physical disabilities.\nLet’s talk about accommodations\nAccommodations come in many shapes and sizes and might look a little different for each student. When considering the needs of students with physical and learning disabilities, extra support can include: longer test taking times, audio recording or note taking services, the use of technology or specialized apps including dictation software, moving a classroom or lab to a more accessible building, among many other possibilities. Some schools take their work of creating a more equitable and accessible learning environment to the next level by offering extensive support services that can include extra mental health support, access to on campus support groups for disabled students, and even athletic teams use adaptive principles. Some schools considered universal design while creating curricula and building infrastructure.\nThis is a list that we researched consisting of the best colleges for students with physical disabilities. In each profile we are highlighting the services they offer and the reasons why it is a good fit for a disabled student entering college. While it can be seen as a list of colleges for special needs students, we’d like to think of it more as a series of schools that frame inclusion as a driving force in their mission.\n1\nStanford University\nStanford, CA\n90.5\nCollege Consensus\n82\nStudent Consensus\n99\nPublisher Consensus\nLast Accessed: November, 2021\nStanford University has a comprehensive resource center that supports disabled students called the Office of Accessible Education.

It was meditation that the world is a much more inclusive place for disabled people then it once was. It is easy to forget that sometimes as we are immersed in media that can often tell us something different. We have come a long way though, and yes, we are still going. Academic environments in particular are evolving to not only be more inclusive to disabled students, but offer majors that support people to understand the history and commit their lives to making the world even more aware. Schools for disabled students are becoming a thing of the past, as the future looks like inclusion and immersion.\nHow Can We Help More Disabled Students Go to College?\nAs you can see, many of the schools on the list are employing universal design strategies that go beyond the concept of “reasonable accommodations.” They do this in service of creating a world that is already usable people of all abilities and bodies. The principles of universal design are some of the most radical in terms of inclusion and adaptability. They are applied to architecture and approaches to learning, which includes curriculum curation. While this is the future, some schools have already begun using these concepts, and others have ways to go. You will see from this list that some schools are much more hands off in their approach to supporting disabled students. They believe in a certain level of self-determination that requires the students to do the majority of the work to get their needs met. Other schools have a model of support that is much more immersive and collaborative. Some of them bring together teams that surround the student, which can include coaches, advisers, and faculty members that are there to ensure the participant is finding what they need in terms of adaptability and emotional support.\nWhat are the Main Barriers Keeping Disabled Students from Going to College?\nAccess has historically, and in some cases continues to be, a real issue. You will see that every school on this list has an inventory of adaptive technologies. Some have their own labs that act as the home to their arsenal of technical resources. Other schools have a check-out system that is done on a case-by-case basis. Many of them provide adaptive furniture, service animals and housing accommodations. Some schools specialize in serving students with learning disabilities and other schools place their focus on ensuring that there are adaptive sports teams and recreational activities that accommodate students in wheelchairs. The primary thing that all of the schools on the list have in common is a commitment to meet the needs of their entire student body, which includes disabled students. Hopefully in the next decade lists like this will no longer be an issue. Let’s all keep working towards the world where accessibility in education and the workplace is a given and not something special. Attending a school on this list and getting educated as a disabled person is a good step towards making that world. As is majoring or minoring in one of the programs that we touched upon in the field of Disability Studies.\nRelated:\nBest Online Colleges in Texas\nTWEET\nSHARE\nFeatures\nThe Ultimate Guide to New Collar Careers\nBest Al­ter­na­tives to College\n10 Great Digitial Tools for College Students\n10 Best Comedy Clubs for College Students\nTop Consensus Ranked Schools with the Nicest Dorms\n35 Best College Dorms\n25 Highest-Paying Al­ter­na­tive Careers for Teachers\nHome\nAbout\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy"
