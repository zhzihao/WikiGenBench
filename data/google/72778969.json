But it makes sense that it would take Roy longer, both because they haven't been spending time together and because their relationship was complicated both by their different positions on the team last year and by their relationships with Keeley. It's usually been the case that Jamie is wrong about everything, so when Ted points out, quite correctly, that Roy is being a jerk for being unwilling to coach Jamie, it complicates — there's that word again — what was previously the \"bratty kid versus wise but gruff veteran\" dynamic between them.\nI also think it's really smart to acknowledge that being able to annoy other players is, in moderation, absolutely a skill that a lot of greats possess. Jamie's taunting of his opponent reminded me a lot of Reggie Miller of the Indiana Pacers, and I encourage you most vigorously to watch the documentary Winning Time if you ever get the chance. This Week In Ted Referential Ted Ice bucket challenge, David Blaine, Sue Grafton, Area 51, H.R. Pufnstuf (\"That is a joke for people born in the early to mid '70s!\"), Rocky, The King of Kong, The Dukes Of Hazzard, Crazy Calls (as near as I can tell, this is the name of the cassette they used to advertise on television with wacky answering-machine messages, including the one on Ted's voicemail that ends with \"wait for the beep\") (arguably another joke for people born in the early to mid '70s). Analytical Ted \"I love meeting people's moms. It's like reading an instruction manual as to why they're nuts.\" Coach Beard Noise of the Week \"LET'S GOOOOOOO!\" Rewatchable of the Week Phil Dunster as Jamie does one of the best deflations I've ever seen on an actor when he asks if he gets to go back to being a jerk and Roy says no. His eyebrows drop, his shoulders drop, and he's immediately about an inch shorter. I couldn't stop watching it. Assist of the Week Annette Badland plays Mae, the proprietor of The Crown & Anchor. She rarely has more than one line at a time, but they always, always sing, as when she reveals that the boys at the end of the bar aren't watching football — they're watching Bake-Off. Stealth MVP of the Week I mean, how could it not be Harriet Walter, who is so funny as Rebecca's mother Deborah? The show really loves those long setups with closing twists, like her description of telling her husband she's going to live her best life that ends with the revelation that she did it while sitting on the toilet. Walter has just the right tone for this dotty-but-aggravating mother.\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail\nSpecial Series Ted Lasso recaps\nRead & Listen\nHome\nNews\nCulture\nMusic\nPodcasts & Shows\nConnect\nNewsletters\nFacebook\nInstagram\nPress\nPublic Editor\nCorrections\nContact & Help\nAbout NPR\nOverview\nDiversity\nNPR Network\nAccessibility\nEthics\nFinances\nGet Involved\nSupport Public Radio\nSponsor NPR\nNPR Careers\nNPR Shop\nNPR Events\nNPR Extra\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nYour Privacy Choices\nText Only\nSponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor"
