It can be found here. For those who purchased the first edition, you will not find much difference besides a name changes (from backtranslated names) so I don't recommend repurchasing.\nThe second edition primarily has the addition of some comments based on the now available Sanskrit edition as well as folio numbers for corresponding pages. A full explanation of changes is in the preface to the second edition.\nShingan's Portal\nTop\nSoma999\nPosts: 692 Joined: Fri Apr 15, 2016 3:52 pm\nRe: Tathāgataguhya Sūtra (Secrets of the Tathāgata) translation now published\nQuote\nPost\nby Soma999 » Thu Nov 17, 2022 9:48 pm\nTop\nZhen Li\nPosts: 2721 Joined: Sun Apr 07, 2013 8:15 am\nRe: Tathāgataguhya Sūtra (Secrets of the Tathāgata) translation now published\nQuote\nPost\nby Zhen Li » Fri Nov 18, 2022 2:45 pm\nThanks Soma, please let me know how it is if you get a chance.\nShingan's Portal\nTop\nPost Reply\nPrint view\nDisplay: All posts1 day7 days2 weeks1 month3 months6 months1 year\nSort by: AuthorPost timeSubject\nDirection: AscendingDescending\n10 posts\n• Page 1 of 1\nJump to\nWelcome\n↳ TERMS OF SERVICE (including Reporting Procedures)\n↳ Announcements\n↳ Introductions\n↳ Suggestion Box\nBodhisattvacarya\n↳ Mahāyāna Buddhism\n↳ Tibetan Buddhism\n↳ Dzogchen\n↳ Nyingma\n↳ Mahamudra\n↳ Kagyu\n↳ Sakya\n↳ Gelug\n↳ Jonang\n↳ Chod\n↳ Bön\n↳ Buddhist Tantra Talk\n↳ East Asian Buddhism\n↳ Zen\n↳ Chan\n↳ Seon\n↳ Rinzai\n↳ Soto\n↳ Thien\n↳ Pure Land\n↳ Jodo Shin Shu\n↳ Tendai\n↳ Nichiren\n↳ Soka Gakkai/SGI\n↳ Nichiren Shu\n↳ Nichiren Shoshu\n↳ Shingon\n↳ Sūtra Studies\n↳ Academic Discussion\nGeneral Dharma\n↳ Discovering Mahayana Buddhism\n↳ Abhidharmakosabhasyam Book Club\n↳ Dharma in Everyday Life\n↳ Help Required\n↳ Dharma Events\n↳ North America (USA & Canada)\n↳ Central & South America\n↳ Europe\n↳ Asia/Pacific\n↳ Australia/NZ\n↳ Africa\n↳ Dharma Stories\n↳ Shrine Room\nUpāya\n↳ Meditation\n↳ Ethical Conduct\n↳ Engaged Buddhism\n↳ Prayers and Aspirations\n↳ Dāna for Dharma\n↳ Wellness, Diet and Fitness\n↳ Alternative Health\n↳ Tibetan Medicine\n↳ Dying and Death\nTeahouse of the Compassionate One\n↳ Lounge\n↳ Creative Writing\n↳ Games & Humour\n↳ Media\n↳ Book Reviews\n↳ Language\n↳ Links to Other DW sites\n↳ LINK TO: Dhamma Wheel Theravada Buddhism Forum\n↳ LINK TO: Dharma Paths—Comparative Religion Forum\n↳ LINK TO: Dhamma/Dharma Wiki - Buddhist encyclopedia\nBuddhism Forum Buddhism Discussion Forum\nAll times are UTC+01:00\nDelete cookies\nContact us\nPowered by phpBB® Forum Software © phpBB Limited\nPrivacy\n|\nTerms"

This annotated translation is the first in any western language. The core message of the Secrets of the Tathāgata is that bodhisattvas and the Buddha manifest in whatever form is necessary to teach and aid sentient beings. It illustrates its teachings with marvellously memorable narratives. Its primary interlocutor is Vajrapāṇi, the vajra (thunderbolt mallet) bearer. He incisively answers the queries of Śāntamati Bodhisattva and narrates his recollection of crucial moments in the Buddha's life. The Secrets of the Tathāgata emphasises that the power of the non-dual and ineffable Buddha underlies all the good deeds and realisations of the bodhisattva, and that his wisdom is inherent in all beings. While the Buddha exerts no effort, he freely manifests for beings based upon their needs and the inclinations of their mind. Beings see the Buddha just like looking at themselves in the mirror, and his words of wisdom sound forth like enchanted instruments that automatically play when wafted by the winds of our karmic inclinations. Shaku Shingan has rendered a readable English translation from the Chinese of the Song Dynasty monk Dharmarakṣa, with critical comparisons and translations from the earlier Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra translation of the same text. This second edition also incorporates insights from the newly available Sanskrit manuscript. Shingan's introduction provides historical background, explains the sūtra's place in the history of Mahāyāna Buddhism and Buddhist studies, and gives the reader an understandable digest of its key themes and doctrines.\nProduct Details\nISBN: 9781716238505\nISBN-10: 1716238501\nPublisher: Lulu.com\nPublication Date: December 21st, 2021\nPages: 324\nLanguage: English\nCategories\nBuddhism - Tibetan\nGet Great Emails\nTempe\n6428 South McClintock Drive\n480.730.0205\nSunday–Friday 10am–8pm\nSaturday 9am-8pm\nTrade Counter:\nSunday–Friday 11am–7pm\nSaturday 10am–7pm\nPhoenix\n300 West Camelback Rd.\n602.274.0067\nSunday–Friday 10am–8pm\nSaturday 9am-8pm\nTrade Counter:\nSunday–Friday 11am–7pm\nSaturday 10am–7pm\nFirst Draft Book Bar\n(Inside Changing Hands Phoenix)\n602.274.0067\n10am–8pm Daily\nOrder Online\nShop Books\nSearch & ShopNew ReleasesKids & TeensAudiobooksStaff PicksUsed BooksConsignmentBulk\nGet Help\nLogin/Create AccountParkingPrivacy PolicyReturn Policy\nIf you need assistance with this website, please contact us.\n© Copyright 2022| All Rights Reserved"

The real happiness brought to mankind by Buddhism is not a satisfaction of self-requirement, but a spiritual benefit\ncoming from enlightenment of the absolute truth, emancipation of the ego of things and persons, and free from the hindrances of passion and ignorance. Buddhism that is mainly based on teachings of the Buddha delivered at different places on different occasions continues to develop and adapt to the new challenges in the form of thought, different cultures, religions, customs and tradition of the people wherever it went. However, all the Buddha’s teachings originate in the enlightenment of the Buddha.\nAll traditions of Buddhism accept that the Buddha attained enlightenment through stages of meditation that led to the Buddhahood endowed with transcendent wisdom and compassion. According to some Mahāyāna scriptures, the Buddhahood is nothing other than the Buddhanature which is the inherent essence within all beings. The doctrine of the Buddha-nature presented in several Mahāyāna scriptures of the so-called Tathāgatagarbha literature was formed in about the third century CE. There is no evidence that the doctrine of Buddha-nature formed a school in India like the Śūnyatā (Emptiness) of the Mādhyamika or the Vijñaptimātratā (Consciousness-only) of the Yogācāra School, but the Buddha-nature plays an important role in the religious life of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the East and Southeast Asian countries because it provides a faith of the permanence and immortality due to a declaration that all sentient beings possess the innate Buddha-nature and have a potentiality of becoming the Buddhas.\nAlthough most of the followers of Mahāyāna Buddhism believe the doctrine of the Buddha-nature and constantly try their best endeavor to attain the goal of Buddhahood, there were a lot of opinions that criticize the doctrine of the Buddha-nature by asserting that it is not Buddhist because this idea of the Buddha-nature seems to be akin to the permanent Self\n(ātman/brahman) presented in the Vedānta of Brahmanism. Conversely, according to some other scholars, the Buddha nature or Tathāgatagarbha referred in some Mahāyāna Sūtras does not represent a substantial self or ego; it is rather a positive language to express the thought of śūnyatā and to represent the potentiality of realizing the Buddhahood through Buddhist\npractices. Modern scholars today fall into an unending discussion about the similarity or difference between the Buddha-nature and Brahman but no one compares the date of these doctrines. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is an attempt to clarify the Buddhist orthodoxy of the doctrine of the Buddha-nature through chronological comparison of the date of Buddha-nature with that of Brahman. Based on the Laṅkāvatārasūtra and other scriptures, the work attempt to elucidate that the Buddhist thought of the Buddha-nature had existed prior the Vedāntic thought of Brahman. Indeed, the thesis shows that while the doctrine of the Buddha-nature had come into existence in the third century CE in the Tathāgatagarbha literature, the\nVedāntic doctrine of Brahman appeared for the first time in the sixth century CE. Consequently, although the Buddha-nature is closely akin to Brahman/ātman of the Vedānta, the doctrine of the Buddha-nature is originally a thought of Buddhism. For this reason, the writer chose the topic\nentitled “Thought of Buddha-nature as Depicted in the LaṅkāvatāraSūtra” for the Ph.D. thesis.\nStudy on the Buddha-nature is a task which cannot be carried out without the important texts, teachings, practices and historical movements of Buddhism. This study is mainly based upon the Laṅkāvatārasūtra, a Buddhist text of the later period of the Tathāgatagarbha literature, in which\nthe thought of the Buddha-nature is depicted in relationship with most of the Mahāyāna concepts such as the Buddhatā, Tathāgatagarbha, Ālayavijñāna, Dharmakāya, Mind-only, etc. Especially, the Laṅkāvatārasūtra emphasizes the practice of self-realization and sudden enlightenment of the Buddha-nature. It is also said that the Sūtra was handed down by Bodhidharma to his heir disciple Hui-ke 慧可 as the proof of enlightenment in Chan (Zen) Buddhism.\nThis thesis is an attempt to investigate and criticize the philosophical and religious thought of the Buddha-nature as depicted in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra. In so doing, we have taken into consideration the following principle themes:\n1. Evolution of the Buddha-nature Concept\n2. The Buddha-nature in the Tathāgatagarbha Literature\n3. The Laṅkāvatārasūtra and Hindu Philosophy\n4. The Thought of Buddha-nature in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra\n5. The Practice of Buddha-Nature in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra\n6.
