For many years, it was a popular bar and restaurant, and later briefly welcomed a gay clientele driven south by bar raids in San Francisco. The buildings that became Hazel's Inn/Casino and Hazel's Motel were first owned and operated by an actress named Mrs. Briggs to live in. Briggs had a Japanese Tea House from the 1915 San Francisco World's Fair relocated to \"Salada Sands\", which became part of the property (The tea house has also been referred to as a portable bungalow). Briggs eventually sold the buildings to Miss Delia R. Mohr, who turned the properties into a tavern and \"auto camp\". Mohr's Auto Camp was quite popular from 1932-1938. However, in 1937, Mohr was arrested for \"violating the state alcohol control act\" for \"illegal possession of liquor\". On March 16, 1939, Delia sold the properties - including cabins, tavern & motel to Earl and Hazel Nickola (sometimes spelled: \"Nikola\" or \"Nicola\"). Two years later, Delia R. Mohr (Strohmeier) passed away of a sudden heart attack in Sharp Park (October 1, 1941). Hazel's by the SeaHazel and Earl re-named the business \"Hazel's Inn\" (also referred to as \"Hazel's Casino\", and \"Hazel's by the Sea\"). They had the second neon sign in Salada Sands (Fred Plate had the first). The casino/Inn had a successful run for almost 20 years. Newspaper ads for Hazel's Inn featured \"Dancing and Swimming\" along with \"Specializing in Assorted Sandwiches\", and \"Beer, Wine Liquors, and Mixed Drinks\". There were games like skee-ball, pool and shuffleboard. The area for dancing had a polished floor, and music provided by a jukebox with the latest tunes . One 1940s ad announced that Hazel's Inn would provide \"Free Moving and Talking Pictures\" at their weekend party. Hazel's was a place to stay (motel & cabins), party, relax, and have fun. Though Hazel's used the term:\"Casino\" in their title, there are no references to an actual casino on the premises. The beach became part of the scene, and was often referred to as \"Hazel's Beach\". For the first five years of its operation, Hazel's was open during WWII, and people needed an escape, a place to socialize, dance and enjoy life. Columnists in Sharp Park Breakers posted about Hazel's Inn, from 1939-1945, mostly snippets about their pets, projects, and parties. The \"References\" section of this page includes some of the Sharp Park Breakers news items.LocationLOCATION: Hazel's Casino/Inn and Motel were located on Casino Way. Many early ads just list their address as \"On the Beach\". You'd find it. Or, \"Old County Road\", which was on the other side of their property - parallel to Casino Way/Ocean Blvd. Then, in 1948, Earl and Hazel Nickola donated 49 lots of their beach property to the county under the State's Beach Acquisition Program, to build a 60-foot-wide continuance of Ocean Blvd (the beach at that point was in danger of washing away). Their generous gift made it possible a for easier access through that part of Sharp Park (plan details are available in the downloads section here), as well as securing the beach area as public property. Eventually, their new address became 31 Ocean Blvd. (though ads in the early 50s still used \"Casino Way\"), which later became 2381 Beach Blvd. The complex of Hazel's Casino/ Inn and Motel, including the cabins just had one address: 31 Ocean Blvd. The general location has been described as :\"..on the beach, between the sewer plant and the golf course. \" In 1940, Earl built a crossroad from Old County Road to the complex, for easier access to Hazel's.ControversyEventually, Hazel and Earl divorced, and she took on the property alone. It was a lot of work, and often challenging. Business started picking up in the mid-50s, partly due to the bar raids in San Francisco and elsewhere in the Bay Area. Homosexual gatherings were being targeted by law enforcement, and Hazel's was a safe place for gay persons to relax and be themselves, at least for awhile. Hazel didn't think anything of it; she was non-judgemental and tolerant, and that people's personal preferences were none of her business. Clients were clients. She was quoted as saying that these customers were better behaved than most. Unfortunately, complaints by neighbors and word-of-mouth about the \"unusual activity\" at Hazel's Inn alerted the Sheriff, leading to a raid on February 19, 1956 , landing 78 men and 10 women in the county jail in Redwood City, on morals charges. Hazel was arrested and booked for \"Permitting dancing on a Sunday, and for operating a dance without a permit\". She was released on $250. bail. According to testimony related to Hazel's Petition for Appeal in 1958, representatives of the San Mateo County Sheriff's office warned her that some of the activities taking place in the tavern should be discontinued. Between January 7, 1956, and February 18th of that year, various agents of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control and members of the sheriff's office, singly and in groups, visited the tavern on at least seven different occasions.The morals charges specifically targeted homosexuals, and described Hazel's as \"...a resort for sexual perverts.\"Full content provided here:https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1810632.htmlThe Hazel's raid is also referenced in the the NorCal ACLU site: https://www.aclunc.org/blog/exploring-aclu-news-archive-intersection-pride-and-police-abuse-powerNote of Historic Importance: Because of this raid, this was the first time the ACLU represented persons who were discriminated against strictly on account of their sexual orientation.Hazel's Motel CondemnedUltimately, Hazel was fined $25., but the resultant publicity eventually ended the existence of the bar, and brought Hazel much grief. For two years and 8 months, Hazel fought to keep her liquor license. During that time, business fell off dramatically. She felt that she was being punished for no reason, and treated as a pariah. Understandably bitter, Hazel cried: \"lt's Iike a strike. Nobody routes near me any more. And after all I've done for this town. I paid plenty of taxes, and I donated 49 lots so they could put a road through here. I helped plenty of PTA people get their relatives out of the can.\"She had sold her car, piano and property to pay for her defense. When asked about her future, Hazel replied: \"I think I'll just go on a little vacation. If the people here paid what they owed me, I could take a whole year off. This way, I don't know how long I'll be gone. If 1 get my price, I'll sell. I still could stay open, but the profit from soft drinks and the jukebox wouldn't even pay my light and gas .\"Hazels' Motel was finally torched by firemen in March of 1961, after being condemned by the city. This was not because of law violations, but because of old age and deterioration. A man named Charles Lane was in charge of abatement of old buildings in Pacifica. Another old building set to be removed at the same time as Hazel's Motel was the Deep Six bar, also on the beach. Because of the location, structures absorbed more wear and tear than in drier climates.Demolition and Moving OnHazel continued to live upstairs in the main building, and in 1959, she sold that property to Chuck Smith and Gene Crouch, who opened the Coastside Bait & Tackle Shop. They knew that the location would be a draw, and in fact was a landmark, known far and wide as Hazel's Beach. Ultimately, in 1966, that building too was condemned, even though Hazel still lived in it. The Coastside Bait & Tackle Shop relocated, re-naming it: \"Coastside Bait & Tackle Shop Number 2\", new address: 1604 Francisco Blvd. By 1968, Hazel still owned property on Beach Blvd., which was being considered for development. In 1973, a building moratorium left the property \"as is\". The CCC also denied construction in that spot, adding to the building moratorium in Sharp Park (apartment buildings have since been built there).\nIn addition to the raid in 1956, Hazel went through rough times in her final years in Pacifica. There were some tragic incidents. On Sunday, January 24, 1954, Hazel discovered the bodies of two of her tenants in what proved to be a murder- suicide in one of the cabins. Lonnie Dickson Williams had shot his wife Ruby, and then turned the gun on himself. Another tragedy was the death of a man named Ray Banta in a fire caused by his cigarette, in 1961. There were also hold-ups, high tides, battles with the city and the sheriff, money depletion, and other trials that had worn her out. She wound up selling the rest of her properties, and moving to Pleasanton, Alameda County, in her last years, where she died at the age of 85 (October 18, 1892- December 1977).

A Legacy of Fighting for Justice and Equality. The ACLU’s first LGBTQ rights case was 33 years before trans women of color led the riot against police brutality and anti-LGBTQ harassment at Stonewall.We look back at some of the pivotal moments in the ACLU’s work to advance equality and justice for LGBTQ people and the work that remains today. 1936Defense of The Children’s Hour against censorship for lesbian contentLillian Hellman’s stage play The Children’s Hour was nearly banned in Boston because of ‘lesbian content.’ The ACLU’s challenge of the attempt toban the play sparked public conversations about LGBTQ people in public life and led to future victories. 1956Defense of San Francisco Bay Area gay bar Hazel’s Inn raided by policeA decade before Stonewall, 87 people were arrested for being “lewd and dissolute” at a bar in Pacifica. Local council of the ACLU appeared on behalf of some of the people in court. Demonstrators carry signs calling for protection of LGBTQ people from discrimination (Associated Press) 1965 First court win in an LGBTQ employment discrimination case The ACLU filedScott v. Macyon behalf of Bruce Scott, a federal worker who was forced to resign under the suspicion that he was gay. In 1965, a federal appeals court ruled in his favor. ACLU successfully challenges police raid on San Francisco LGBTQ eventThe San Francisco Police Department tried to shut down a New Year’s Eve 1964 fundraiser dance for the newly-formed Council on Religion and the Homosexual, one of the nation’s first faith-based LGBTQ rights groups. Police attempted to scare patrons away with floodlights and cameras and multiple “fire inspections” and when event organizers asked to be shown a warrant police responded by arresting them. The ACLU defended the organizers at a trial, where the jury took only 10 minutes to return a unanimous verdict of not guilty. The raid, the surrounding publicity, and the subsequent trial led to unprecedented changes: the appointment of a special liaison between the police department and the gay community and the formation of an LGBTQ community hotline to report police abuse. 1967ACLU opposed Los Angeles ordinance targeting transgender people and LGBTQ clubsIn the early fall of 1967, the Los Angeles police cracked down on the performances of Sir Lady Java, a Black trans woman from Louisiana, at the Redd Foxx Club. Invoking Rule No. 9, which made it illegal for performers to “impersonat by means of costume or dress a person of the opposite sex,” the police threatened to arrest the owner of Redd Foxx if Sir Lady Java ever again got up on the club’s stage. The ACLU threatened to sue over the rule but the club owner was unwilling to be a plaintiff. Sir Lady Java continued to publicly protest the rule and ultimately another lawsuit declared the rule unconstitutional. %3Ciframe%20thumb%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aclu.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fvideo_thumbnail_1030x580%2Fpublic%2Fweb19-pride-like-its-1969-youtube-thumbnail.jpg%3Fitok%3Dl5pE1iwM%22%20class%3D%22media-youtube-player%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22576%22%20title%3D%22Pride%20Like%20It%27s%201969%20%7C%20June%2012%2C%202019%20Act%203%20%7C%20Full%20Frontal%20on%20TBS%22%20src%3D%22%2F%2Fwww.youtube-nocookie.com%2Fembed%2FJcdLl_udbew%3Fwmode%3Dopaque%26amp%3Bmodestbranding%3D1%26amp%3Brel%3D0%26amp%3Bshowinfo%3D0%26amp%3Bcolor%3Dwhite%26autoplay%3D1%26version%3D3%22%20frameborder%3D%220%22%20allowfullscreen%3D%22%22%20allow%3D%22autoplay%22%3EVideo%20of%20Pride%20Like%20It%26amp%3B%23039%3Bs%201969%20%7C%20June%2012%2C%202019%20Act%203%20%7C%20Full%20Frontal%20on%20TBS%3C%2Fiframe%3E Privacy statement.

U.S. First challenge to law restricting marriage for same-sex couplesA same-sex couple in Minnesota, Richard Baker and James Michael McConnell, applied for a marriage license and were denied by county officials. Their challenge, Baker v. Nelson, went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court but was dismissed “for want of a substantial federal question.” Demonstrators protest the Supreme Court’s ruling on consensual sex between same-sex adults (Associated Press) 1986 Launch of National ACLU Lesbian and Gay Rights Project and AIDS Project Leaders of the modern LGBTQ rights movement, including philanthropist and first openly-gay U.S. ambassador James C. Hormel, formed what has become the LGBTQ & HIV Project. One week later the Supreme Court upheld Georgia’s sodomy law criminalizing consensual sex. The loss inBowers v. Hardwickdid not stop founding director Nan Hunter from fighting in the courts and in communities for LGBTQ people and those living with HIV. 1989Supreme Court recognizes trans women in prisons should be protected from sexual assaultOn August 21, 1989, Dee Farmer, a Blacktranswoman, sued prison officials after being raped in a maximum security men’s federal prison. On June 6, 1994, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Farmer v. Brennan that Dee Farmer’s case against the prison could move forward. Tens of thousands of subsequent court decisions have cited Dee’s case and the legal standard it established.

It was not the first time police raided a gay bar, and it was not the first time LGBTQ+ people fought back, but the events that would unfold over the next six days would fundamentally change the discourse surrounding LGBTQ+ activism in the United States. While Stonewall became well known due to the media coverage and the subsequent annual Pride traditions, it was a culmination of years of LGBTQ+ activism. Historians have noted that the shift in activism, if Stonewall truly represented one at all, was a shift primarily for white cisgender people, as people of color and gender non-conforming people never truly had the benefit of concealing their marginalized identities.\nWhile the events of Stonewall are often referred to as \"riots,\" Stonewall veterans have explicitly stated that they prefer the term Stonewalluprising orrebellion. The reference to these events as riots was initially used by police to justify their use of force.\n\"The rebellion (it was never a 'riot') lasted five inconsecutive nights (they were not 'riots')...\" -STONEWALL Veterans' Association\nIt is important to note that there were a number of uprisings against police & statebrutality, harassment and entrapment of the LGBT+ communities in the U.S.in the years before Stonewall. These events and the people involved have not received as much historical attention as Stonewall, but are just as central to understandings of U.S. LGBTQIA+ histories.Some of the pre-Stonewall uprisingsincluded:\nPepper Hill Club Raid, Baltimore, Maryland in 1955. Over 162 people arrested.\nHazel's (Hazel's Inn), Sharp Park, California February 1956\nCoopers Do-Nut Raid, Los Angeles, California, 1959\nBlack NiteBrawl, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, August 5, 1961\nCompton's Cafeteria Raid, San Francisco, California, 1966\nBlack Cat Raid, Los Angeles, California, 1967\nThere have been many incidents in which police interaction with LGBTQ+ communities has resulted in violence, and in response, protest. Bars were one of the few places LBGTQ+ people could gather in public, and these spaces were frequently raided throughout the 1950s-1970s. It is important to note that in addition to arresting LGBTQ+ people, first-hand accounts reveal the violence that police enacted on those they had arrested. Often, those who had survived police raids were hospitalized or had to seek medical care for their injuries. Notably, an uncounted number of LGBTQ+ people have died as a result of police raids on gay spaces. Police violence and bar raids did not end after Stonewall. One poignant example is the murder of Frederick Wiliam Paez on the 11th anniversary of Stonewall (June 28 1980) who was shot by a police officer who had solicited him.\nTo find additional materials on this topic, search the Library of Congress Online Catalog:\nPolice BrutalityDemonstrations-1960-1980Gay RightsPolice 1960-1980Pickets- 1960-1980\nThe following titles link to fuller bibliographic information in the Library of Congress Online Catalog.

Through the lenses of protest, power, and pride, We Are Everywhere is an essential and empowering introduction to the history of the fight for queer liberation. Combining exhaustively researched narrative with meticulously curated photographs, the book traces queer activism from its roots in late-nineteenth-century Europe--long before the pivotal Stonewall Riots of 1969--to the gender warriors leading the charge today.Pride Parades by Katherine McFarland BruceCall Number: HQ76.965.G38 B78 2016ISBN: 9781479803613Published/Created: 2016-10-04On June 28, 1970, two thousand gay and lesbian activists in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago paraded down the streets of their cities in a new kind of social protest, one marked by celebration, fun, and unashamed declaration of a stigmatized identity. Forty-five years later, over six million people annually participate in 115 Pride parades across the United States.The Stonewall Reader by Edmund White (Foreword by); New York Public Library (Editor)Call Number: HQ76.8.U5 S77 2019ISBN: 9780143133513Published/Created: 2019-04-30For the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, an anthology chronicling the tumultuous fight for LGBTQ rights in the 1960s and the activists who spearheaded it June 28, 2019 marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Stonewall uprising - the most significant event in the gay liberation movement and the catalyst for the modern fight for LGBTQ rights in the United States. Drawing from the New York Public Library's archives, The Stonewall Reader is a collection of firsthand accounts, diaries, periodic literature and articles from LGBTQ magazines and newspapers that documented both the years leading up to and the years following the riots. Most importantly, this anthology shines a light on forgotten figures who were pivotal in the movement, such as Lee Brewster, head of the Queens Liberation Front and Ernestine Eckstine, one of the few out, African American, lesbian activists in the 1960s.Stonewall by Martin Bauml DubermanCall Number: HQ76.8.U5 D85 1993ISBN: 9780593083987Published/Created: 2019-06-04On June 28, 1969, the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York's Greenwich Village, was raided by police. But instead of responding with the routine compliance the NYPD expected, patrons and a growing crowd decided to fight back. The five days of rioting that ensued changed forever the face of gay and lesbian life. In Stonewall, renowned historian and activist Martin Duberman tells the full story of this pivotal moment in history. With riveting narrative skill, he recreates those revolutionary, sweltering nights in vivid detail through the lives of six people who were drawn into the struggle for LGBTQ rights.Stonewall by David CarterCall Number: HQ76.8.U5 C37 2004ISBN: 9780312671938Published/Created: 2010-05-25In 1969, a series of riots over police action against The Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's Greenwich Village, changed the landscape of homosexual society quite literally overnight. Since then, the term 'Stonewall' itself has become almost synonymous with the struggle for gay rights. Based on hundreds of interviews, an exhaustive search of public and previously sealed files and over a decade of intensive research, Stonewall tells the definitive story of this singular event in history.The Gay Crusaders by Tobin, KayCall Number: HQ76.8.U5 T6 1972\nThe Stonewall Era: 1966-1969\nStonewall Uprising, New York, N.Y., 1969.\nGay activists.\nGay liberation movement.\nGay rights.\nJohnson, Marsha P.\nRivera, Sylvia.\nFirst Pride March: 1970\n<< Previous: The Mattachine SocietyNext: Activism After Stonewall >>\nLast Updated: Sep 15, 2023 1:40 PM\nURL: https://guides.loc.gov/lgbtq-studies\nPrint Page\nLogin to LibApps\nSubjects: Gender and Women’s Studies, LGBTQ+ Studies\nBack to top\nHosted by Springshare\nLibrary of Congress Legal\nSpringShare Privacy Policy"
