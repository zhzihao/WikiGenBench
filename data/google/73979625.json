So, if you're someone who's getting into this, as we did on June 7, you know, where you don't have national name recognition because you haven't held national office you haven't, you know, been a pundit on a national television program.\"Even though Burgum was able to qualify for the first two GOP debates, he failed to reach the RNC threshold for the third debate held in Miami, Florida, last month.Before Burgum took office as North Dakota governor in December 2016, he was a successful businessman who founded a software company he later sold to Microsoft for over $1 billion. After the sale, Burgum stayed on as senior vice president of Microsoft's Business Solutions Group until he stepped down in 2007.In 2008, he co-founded a venture capital company called Arthur Ventures that focused on investing in clean technology and life sciences.\nAbout 80% of Burgum's campaign was self-funded. According to his Federal Election Commission filings, he invested $12.2 million in his campaign and raised a total of $15.1 million since he announced his candidacy.After Burgum gave $20 gift cards to anyone who would donate a $1 to his campaign — a strategy to help him qualify for the first Republican debate by helping him reach the 40,000 unique-donor threshold, a Forbes analysis said his net worth was approximately $100 million.\nElection 2024\nMore\nTrump pushes misinformation suggesting Dems would \"infiltrate\" New Hampshire GOP primary\nNo Labels files complaint with DOJ about groups fighting its ballot access effort\nNikki Haley turns to unlikely pair to help her beat Trump in New Hampshire\nHow fringe anti-science views infiltrated politics — and what it means in 2024\nCongresswoman rumored as possible VP pick to hit trail with Trump in New Hampshire\nMore\nCristina Corujo\nFirst published on December 4, 2023 / 11:10 AM EST\nContinue\nPlease enter email address to continue\nPlease enter valid email address to continue\nMore from CBS News\nAsa Hutchinson drops out of 2024 GOP presidential race\nAsa Hutchinson's anti-Trump presidential campaign mocked by DNC\nTrump's margin of victory in the Iowa GOP caucuses smashed previous record\nCongresswoman rumored as possible VP pick to hit trail with Trump in New Hampshire\nCopyright ©2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

OffOnLOG INStream onElections DashboardState ResultsPrimary ScheduleEntrance/Exit PollsNorth Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum drops out of 2024 presidential raceHe had failed to qualify for the most recent Republican debate.ByKelsey WalshDecember 4, 2023, 12:31 PM2:07North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum speaks to guests at the Republican Party of Iowa 2023 Lincoln Dinner on July 28, 2023 in Des Moines.Scott Olson/Getty Images, FILEDoug Burgum dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential primary, his campaign announced on Monday.\"In community after community along this journey, we witnessed the best that America has to offer. We are deeply grateful for each and every person who supported us with their ideas, prayers, advocacy, encouragement and enthusiasm,\" Burgum said in a statement.The North Dakota governor had emphasized three key issues on the trail -- the economy, energy and national security -- but failed to gain traction with GOP voters. He was polling last on the list of major candidates tracked by 538's national average and did not qualify for the most recent primary debate.Burgum's exit narrows the field yet again as rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley pitch themselves as viable alternatives to former President Donald Trump, the front-runner despite his many legal troubles and controversies. (He denies wrongdoing.)In his statement, Burgum, a former software executive before entering politics, said he began his campaign \"clear-eyed about our mission: bring a business leader and proven governor's voice to the fight for the best of America.\"He said he was proud of how his messaging had, in his view, focused the 2024 conversation on the \"essential, core responsibilities of the President and the executive branch,\" such as foreign policy.Senior staff found out he was going to drop out this weekend, following his last visit in New Hampshire -- where Burgum appeared emotional while speaking at his events. (He will pay his staff until the end of December.)On Saturday, Burgum addressed a room full of voters at a county GOP meeting in Amherst, New Hampshire. There wasn't a single person in the room who said they planned to vote for him.The consensus remained that their admiration for Bugum would not turn into support for him as the nominee -- as voters instead said they were looking at candidates such as Haley and DeSantis.Overall, members showed up to pay their party dues and chat with \"a respectable and nice guy,\" as one person put it.Throughout his presidential campaign, Burgum never bashed an opposing candidate or commented on Trump's legal battles. He even shied away from rhetoric regarding culture politics.Instead, Burgum remained hyper-focused on his three core issues.His only negative attacks were directed at the Republican National Committee, which he reiterated on Monday, calling out their \"clubhouse debate requirements\" for \"nationalizing the primary process and taking the power of democracy away from the engaged, thoughtful citizens of Iowa and New Hampshire.\"North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum speaks to guests at the Republican Party of Iowa 2023 Lincoln Dinner on July 28, 2023 in Des Moines.Scott Olson/Getty Images, FILEEach successive GOP primary has required candidates to get higher and higher percentages either in national polls or certain state polls, as well as receive more and more donors.\"None of their debate criteria relate to the qualifications related to actually doing the job of the president,\" Burgum argued.The governor had an underdog mentality that continued into the final weeks of his campaign.\"America loves an underdog,\" Burgum said back in October. \"We're gaining momentum every day and every week.\"In order to get on the first debate stage, Burgum, who is independently wealthy from his business career, gifted $20 gift cards to 50,000 people who gave $1 to his campaign.The night ahead of that debate, Burgum tore his Achilles tendon. In between his governorship in North Dakota and campaigning in the presidential race, he spent his days rehabbing from his injury.During the second debate, Burgum poured more money into ad buys and another gift card giveaway to reach the RNC's donor threshold. He failed to make the cut for last month's debate, however.Still, he projected optimism about the future and said on Monday: \"We remain committed to improving the lives of every American by moving America 180 degrees in the opposite direction of Joe Biden.\"\"Our decision to run for President came from a place of caring deeply about every American and a mission to re-establish trust in America's leadership and our institutions of democracy,\" Burgum said of he and his wife, Kathryn.It's unclear what is next for Burgum. He is able to seek another term as governor and he repeatedly denied interest in a Cabinet position in another Republican administration.\"While this primary process has shaken my trust in many media organizations and political party institutions, it has only strengthened my trust in America,\" he said in his statement on Monday. \"Our nation doesn't need to be perfect to be exceptional.\"Related Topics2024 ElectionsRepublican PrimaryTop StoriesMalia Obama makes red carpet debut at Sundance 20243 hours agoLos Angeles Innocence Project takes up case of notorious killer Scott PetersonJan 18, 6:42 PMHBCU administrator's death by suicide prompts calls for president's resignationJan 19, 1:03 AM15 students and 1 teacher drown when a boat capsizes in a lake in western IndiaJan 18, 9:35 AMConcertgoers sue Madonna over show starting lateJan 18, 12:06 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkAbout Nielsen MeasurementChildren's Online Privacy PolicyContact UsDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationInterest-Based AdsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseYour US State Privacy Rights © 2024 ABC News"

It’s the main thing. A strong American economy propels everything else and is the key to unlocking the best of America.\nInnovation has always been America’s best weapon. Innovation over regulation is how you solve the challenges we face today. Regulation looks backward and innovation looks towards the future. It’s provided an opportunity for a better life to Americans willing to reach for it. All that is now at risk.\n‍Doug will get inflation under control, cut taxes, lower gas prices, reduce the cost of living and help people realize their fullest potential.\n‍Energy\nA key reason we need to empower American innovation is to dramatically increase energy production. Energy has to be our second priority.\n‍Doug knows we need to stop buying energy from our enemies and start selling energy to our friends and allies. America produces energy cleaner and safer than anywhere else in the world. When America becomes truly energy independent and supports our allies we prevent wars like Putin started in Ukraine. We stabilize the globe and restore America as the leader of the free world.\n‍As the governor of one of the largest energy producing states in America and a business leader who built a software company that served 140,000 different businesses in 132 countries, Doug understands the future is going to be won at the intersection of innovation and energy.\n‍National Security\nDoug believes we need to recognize the real threats to America and strengthen national security.\n‍Our enemies aren’t our neighbors down the street. Our enemies are countries that want to see our way of life destroyed. In a country built on neighbors helping neighbors, we’ve become a country of neighbors fighting neighbors.\nWe should be fighting to unite the country against our common enemies like China and Putin.\n2024 Republican presidential candidate logos\nCandidate\nLogo\nSlogan\nDoug Burgum\nA New Leader for a Changing Economy\nFighting for the Best of America\nCampaign staff\nSee also: Doug Burgum presidential campaign staff, 2024, Presidential election key staffers, 2024, and Presidential election campaign managers, 2024\nThe table below shows a partial list of national campaign staff members, including the campaign manager, senior advisors, political directors, communications directors, field directors, and the national press secretary.

Doug Burgum announced Monday that he's dropping out of the race for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination after failing to qualify for the most recent debates.\"The RNC’s clubhouse debate requirements are nationalizing the primary process and taking the power of democracy away from the engaged, thoughtful citizens of Iowa and New Hampshire,\" Burgum said in a statement bashing the rules that kept him out of recent debates.\"The RNC’s mission is to win elections,\" he continued. \"It is not their mission to reduce competition and restrict fresh ideas by ‘narrowing the field’ months before the Iowa caucuses or the first in the nation New Hampshire primary. These arbitrary criteria ensure advantages for candidates from major media markets on the coasts versus America’s Heartland.\"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum in Des Moines, Iowa, on July 28.Charlie Neibergall / AP fileBurgum argued that none of the debate criteria are qualifications for serving as president. He said, \"This effort to nationalize the primary system is unhealthy for the future of the party, especially for a party that proclaims to value leadership from outside of Washington.\"His announcement comes just a few weeks after he said at a stop in Des Moines, Iowa, that he would not suspend his campaign before New Hampshire's GOP primary on Jan. 23. \"We’re going through all the effort to get our name on all 50 state ballots,\" he said at the time. \"Iowa, New Hampshire, absolutely positively. We’re going to be here. We’re going to be campaigning in Iowa; we’re going to be campaigning in New Hampshire.\"He reiterated this sentiment later in the month, telling NBC News that staying till New Hampshire was\"our plan all along.\"Burgum, 67, who has served as governor of North Dakota since 2016, consistently trailed many of the other candidates in the polls for the GOP nomination. Former President Donald Trump is still leading the pack.To qualify for the last Republican debate in Miami, which Burgum failed to do, candidates had to meet Republican National Committee criteria, including accruing at least 70,000 unique donors and meeting a minimum polling requirement (at least 4% in two national polls or one national and one early-state poll that meet RNC requirements). Candidates were also required to sign pledges, including one in which he or she had to commit to supporting the Republican Party’s eventual nominee.Burgum had also not qualified for the next debate, set for Wednesday.A source close to the matter said senior staff members on the campaign found out this weekend that Burgum would be dropping out and the rest of the team found out Monday morning. The source said that Burgum, whose campaign is mostly self-funded, is paying the team through December.His most recent filings showed that the campaign had raised $12.2 million from Burgum himself out of a total of $15.2 million.Burgum is eligible to run for a third term as governor. He has until next summer to declare his intention to run for re-election.There are six remaining candidates: Trump, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.Rebecca ShabadRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.Alex Tabet, Emma Barnett and Isabelle Schmeler contributed.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of Service (Updated JULY 7, 2023)NBC News SitemapClosed CaptioningAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance©2024 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo"
