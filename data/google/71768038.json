Swift has never confirmed whether the song is about him, but in any case, the lyrics to “Dear John” seem to be about romantic betrayal.“You paint me a blue sky/ And go back and turn it to rain/ And I lived in your chess game/ But you changed the rules every day,” she sings in one verse. “Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight/ Well, I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why.”Swift recently gave a surprise performance of “Dear John” during a stop in Minneapolis on her “Eras Tour.” Before performing the ballad, she called for “kindness and gentleness” and asked fans not to harass any (rumored) subjects of her songs.“I’m not putting this album out so that you can go and feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I might have written a song about 14 billion years ago when I was 19,” she said. “I do not care. We have all grown up. We’re good.”Mayer addressed “Dear John” in a 2012 Rolling Stone interview, saying he had been “really humiliated” by the song.“It made me feel terrible,” he said. “Because I didn’t deserve it. I’m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.”In her prologue to the “Speak Now” re-release, Swift called the album “unfiltered and potent” and said it captured a transformative time in her younger life.“I made this album, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20,” she writes. “I was encountering the milestones and checkpoints of normal teenage growth. I had cataclysmic crushes and brushes with heartache.”Another portion of the prologue discusses going through some that teenage growth while in the limelight: “I experienced the weirdness of trying to get to know a boy while a swarm of paparazzi surrounds the car. Media contacting my publicist for an official statement on why two teenagers broke up. These are weird experiences to have at any age, but even more surreal when you’re 19.”It’s possible she’s discussing actor Taylor Lautner, who was photographed in cars with Swift when they were romantically linked in 2009. Her song “Back to December” is rumored to be about him. Back in May, Lautner told TODAY.com that he “felt safe” amid the upcoming re-release of “Speak Now,” but was “praying for John.”“Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” also includes six previously unreleased tracks, including one song, “When Emma Falls In Love,” rumored to be about her longtime friend, actor Emma Stone.Lindsay LoweLindsay Lowe has been a regular contributor to TODAY.com since 2016, covering pop culture, style, home and other lifestyle topics.

Taylor Swift has officially released her Speak Now (Taylor's Version) album. The highly-anticipated re-release drew much support from fans after Taylor revealed that she would be dropping the project during a stop on her Eras Tour in Minneapolis this past June. \"Dear John\" was one of the 2010 album's most talked about songs, largely because fans believed the song's lyrics alluded to Taylor's rumored relationship with singer John Mayer.Don't remember the tea about their brief ship? Here's a recap. Taylor was 19 when she allegedly dated the 32-year-old singer from December 2009 to February 2010. The song's lyrics about a devastating breakup, references to Tay's age, the inclusion of a guitar that sounds similar to the ones John often uses in his music, and the fact that his name was used in the song's title fueled fan theories that the song was inspired by their short-lived relationship.On June 24, the Grammy winner asked her fans for \"kindness\" ahead of the album's release. \"I'm 33 years old. I don't care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote,\" she said, \"So what I'm trying to tell you is that I am not putting this album out, so you should feel the need to defend me on the internet against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago.\"Check out \"Dear John (Taylor's Version)\" below if you haven’t yet (tbh, it's been on repeat since midnight), and if you’re still not convinced about the message behind the song, keep scrolling for the full lyrics to Taylor’s \"Dear John (Taylor's Version).\"View full post on YoutubeLyrics provided by Genius.You shoulda knownDon't you think I was too young?You shoulda knownRelated StoriesA Reminder on Why Taylor is Re-Recording Her MusicTaylor Swift Songs We'll Love Forever & Always Taylor Swift Goes Rosy in a $58 Floral TankJasmine WashingtonAssistant EditorJasmine Washington is an Assistant Editor at Seventeen, where she covers celebrity news, beauty, lifestyle, and more.
