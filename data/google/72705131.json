Published on January 9, 2023, at 11:53 am (Paris), updated on January 9, 2023, at 12:02 pm Time to 2 min. Lire en français Share Share Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Linkedin Copy link Almost two years to the day after the assault on the Capitol in Washington, the symbols of Brazilian democracy were in turn damaged by hordes refusing the verdict of the ballot box. As in the United States, an attempted coup d'état took place in the Brazilian capital, which was left in chaos until the police forces restored order. This is a worrying state of affairs for the young democracy, born 38 years ago on the ruins of a military dictatorship. This attack was, unfortunately, predictable. The populists' claim to the exclusive right to speak for a largely imagined people makes them incapable of respecting the rules that guarantee the proper functioning of a democracy, starting with the peaceful transfer of power in the context of a changeover. Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés In Brazil, an 'unprecedented' attack on democracy This represents a twofold disdain of the Brazilian people since it rests on the cynical manipulation of militants fired up by complacent social media platforms. Lulling them into alternative, conspiratorial truths and into a hatred of elites judged guilty of all the evils consciously led them toward the assault on Brasilia, only one week after Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sworn in. As in the US on January 6, 2021, what happened in Brazil on January 8 was not accidental or coincidental. The proven links between Donald Trump's most radical advisors and the entourage of the deposed president, Jair Bolsonaro, reinforce suspicions. Although this grotesque embryo of an international insurgency, firmly anchored on the far right, is fortunately for the moment amassing defeats. No half-measures The January 8 invasion of the Brazilian Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace – an astonishing statement that gives a dizzying sense of the magnitude of this attack – resulted from a plot. Its instigators must be found, prosecuted and punished. The role of Brasilia's governor, Ibaneis Rocha, who has been suspended from office, must also be clarified, as must the passivity of certain police forces, suspected of possible affinities with the insurgents. The responsibility of the former Brazilian president – who went to Florida to nurse his resentment with his American mentor before his successor took power – is also on the table. His inability to clearly acknowledge defeat and his temptation to separate the electoral results between the many who were favorable to his movement and the ones who put an end to his personal ambitions prepared the ground for this coup attempt. He has further disqualified himself by his lackluster response to the events in Brasilia. Read more World leaders denounce attack on Brazilian Congress If there is a lesson to be learned from the American precedent, it is that we cannot respond to such affronts to democracy with half-measures. This is for the common good. In the US, the inability of the Republican Party to distance itself from the Trump camp, trapped in its denial of defeat, deprived it of the hoped-for victory in the midterm elections. Already forced to deal with the resilience of a majority of Bolsonaro supporters in Parliament and in control of many Brazilian states, President Lula's task was already proving difficult. Now he has to lead a counter-offensive in the name of democratic values.

Indeed, the list of those arrested for involvement in the riot contains more than a dozen active and retired military personnel.\nThe analyst added that the situation could even hand Lula greater support in Congress.\n“I’m not saying he’ll have a massive ruling coalition, but most politicians, even from the opposition, will look to distance themselves from Bolsonaro,” Lima said.\nFrom a global standpoint, FGV international relations professor Oliver Stuenkel said that an overwhelming majority of world leaders have shown solidarity with the Lula government and its efforts to prosecute the rioters, out of fear that similar attacks could occur elsewhere.\n“The international reading of this is that, the more rigorous the response from Brazilian courts, the less risk there is of the January 8 attacks inspiring similar movements in other countries,” Stuenkel said.\nProtesters on January 8 stormed the presidential palace in Brasilia and smashed this antique clock from France’s King Louis XIV, shown here missing ornamentation and its clock face\nSource: Al Jazeeraaj-logoaj-logoaj-logoAboutShow moreAbout UsCode of EthicsTerms and ConditionsEU/EEA Regulatory NoticePrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesSitemapWork for usHR QualityConnectShow moreContact UsUser Accounts HelpAdvertise with usAppsNewslettersChannel FinderTV SchedulePodcastsSubmit a TipOur ChannelsShow moreAl Jazeera ArabicAl Jazeera EnglishAl Jazeera Investigative UnitAl Jazeera MubasherAl Jazeera DocumentaryAl Jazeera BalkansAJ+Our NetworkShow moreAl Jazeera Centre for StudiesAl Jazeera Media InstituteLearn ArabicAl Jazeera Centre for Public Liberties & Human RightsAl Jazeera ForumAl Jazeera Hotel PartnersFollow Al Jazeera English:facebooktwitteryoutubeinstagram-colored-outlinerss© 2024 Al Jazeera Media Network"

Share Share Share on Twitter Share on Messenger Share on Facebook Share by email Share on Linkedin Copy link The US government on Sunday, January 9, offered \"unwavering\" support for Brazil's democracy as condemnation poured in from around the world against mobs that smashed their way into the halls of power in Brasilia. Argentine President Alberto Fernandez assailed the \"coup attempt\" by supporters of far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro who stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace. Fellow South American leaders in Chile, Colombia and Venezuela deplored the mob action, and French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted his support for Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who took office as Brazil's leader a week ago. \"The will of the Brazilian people and the democratic institutions must be respected!\" Mr. Macron tweeted in French and Portuguese. US President Joe Biden on Sunday called an assault on government buildings by a mob supporting defeated president Jair Bolsonaro \"outrageous.\" The European Union's top foreign affairs official, Josep Borrell, tweeted that he was \"appalled by the acts of violence and illegal occupation of Brasilia's government quarter by violent extremists today... \"Brazilian democracy will prevail over violence and extremism,\" he added. The Twitter account of Democrats on the US Senate foreign relations committee noted that the Brasilia ransacking came nearly two years to the day after supporters of then-president Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election, leaving five dead. \"Trump's legacy continues to poison our hemisphere,\" the tweet said. Around the Western hemisphere, the reaction was particularly swift from leaders ideologically akin to Lula. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador tweeted: \"Lula is not alone, he has the support of the progressive forces of his country, of Mexico, of the American continent and of the world.\" Chilean President Gabriel Boric decried \"this cowardly and vile attack on democracy\" and said the Lula government has Chile's \"complete backing.\" Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, a leftist authoritarian, condemned what he called the \"neofascist groups\" seeking to unseat Lula.
