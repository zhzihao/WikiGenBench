Jason Harley Kloepfer, 41, from North Carolina, US, was shot in the chest and arm after Cherokee County police responded to reports of a gunfire on December 12 at around 11pm. Cops believed Kloepfer, who identifies as disabled, was the alleged gunman and holding a hostage inside his trailer - despite being inside with his wife. In the shocking footage, Kloepfer is seen inside the trailer opening the door to police. Kloepfer, and his wife Alison Mahler, both raise their hands in the air to show they are unarmed. Despite being unarmed officers fire seven shots at Kloepfer forcing him to the ground.\nMonterey Park shooter who killed 10 was 'hostile' dance teacher who married a student\nHis wife shouts at officers after her husband was shot\n(\nHe was quickly rushed to hospital in a critical but stable condition. Authorities claim Kloepfer had been involved in a verbal disagreement with police prior to opening the door and insisted he \"confronted\" them before being shot. In the video, his wife can be seen pulling Kloepfer out of the police's line of fire as he started to scream \"I've been shot!\" Mahler screams at police while helping her husband: \"What the hell? He's shot - what the hell did you do? Cops demanded the pair come outside from the trailer as Mahler held her hands up and came out - despite wanting to stay with her injured husband. Kloepfer had to drag himself towards the door but struggled as his wife shouted: \"He can't!
