Utility Nav News ArticlesFIRST-PERSON: Republicans & the relics of barbarism By Robert P. George & William L. Saunders, posted September 8, 2004 in Metadata:Format(s):Text ArticlesShare this post: PRINCETON, N.J. (BP)–In the middle of the 19th century, a new political party emerged dedicated to two great moral struggles. The Republican Party pledged to fight the “twin relics of barbarism”: slavery and polygamy.By then, slavery was deeply entrenched in the culture of the American south. What some had regarded as a “necessary evil” that would gradually die out had been given a new lease on life by technological developments, and by the emergence of profitable overseas markets for cotton. An entire social and economic system was built on slavery. No longer was it reasonable to hope that the “peculiar institution,” and with it the moral controversy convulsing the nation, would quietly fade away. Powerful interests had a stake not only in maintaining the slave system, but in extending it into the western territories of the United States.So the Republicans faced a daunting challenge. Pro-slavery Democrats condemned them as “fanatics” and “zealots” who sought to impose their religious scruples and moral values on others. Slaveholders demanded that they “mind their own business” and stay out of the “domestic” and “private” affairs of others. Defenders of a “right” to own slaves pointedly invited northern abolitionists to redirect their moral outrage towards the “wage slave” system in the north. “If you are against slavery,” they in effect said, “then don’t own a slave.”By the mid-1850s, polygamy, which had originally been the largely secret practice of the Mormon elite, had come out of the closet. Polygamists claimed that attacks on “plural marriage” were violations of their right to religious freedom. Later, some would bring lawsuits asking judges to invalidate laws against polygamy as unconstitutional. One of these cases would make it all the way to the Supreme Court. Apologists for polygamy denied that plural marriage was harmful to children, and challenged supporters of the ban on polygamy to prove that the existence of polygamous families in American society harmed their own monogamous marriages. They insisted that they merely wanted the right to be married in their own way and left alone.But the Republicans stood their ground, refusing to be intimidated by the invective being hurled against them. They knew that polygamy and slavery were morally wrong and socially corrosive. And they were prepared to act on their moral convictions.For the Republicans, the idea that human beings could be reduced to the status of mere “objects” to be bought and sold and exploited for the benefit of others was a profound violation of the intrinsic dignity of creatures made in the image and likeness of God. Similarly, the idea that marriage could be redefined to accommodate a man’s desire for multiple sexual partners was, as they saw it, deeply contrary to the meaning of marriage as joining a man and a woman in a permanent and exclusive bond.In the great moral struggles of the 19th century, the Republicans sought advantage in every morally legitimate and available way. Where appropriate, they would accept strategic compromises on the road to victory; but they would not compromise away their principles.When in the Dred Scott decision the Supreme Court of the United States announced its discovery of what amounted to a constitutional right of slaveholding, Lincoln and other leading Republicans refused to treat the case as a binding precedent. They would not bow to judicial usurpation. When Utah sought admission as a state, the Republican-controlled Congress made statehood conditional upon incorporation of a prohibition of polygamy into the state constitution.As Republicans gather in New York this week, they would do well to remember their moral heritage. The twin relics of barbarism have returned in distinctively modern garb. Abortion and embryo-destructive research are premised on the proposition that some human beings — those in the embryonic and fetal stages of development — may legitimately be reduced to objects that can be created and destroyed for the benefit of others. At the same time, the ideology of sexual liberationism threatens to undercut the traditional understanding of marriage as the permanent and exclusive union of one man and one woman.A familiar mantra of “pro-choice” politicians is that abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare.” Now, however, they seek to validate and fund a massive industry that would create human beings for the precise purpose of destroying them during the embryonic stage of development in biomedical research. What happened with slavery is now happening with embryo-killing: The people who used to defend it as a “necessary evil” to be resisted or lessened by means other than legal prohibition now promote it as a social good — something that law and government should not only tolerate but embrace and even promote.At the same time, the sexual-liberationist movement seeks to undermine traditional understandings of the meaning and significance of human sexuality. The attempt to abolish the legal concept of marriage as the one-flesh union of a man and a woman is part of a larger effort to “liberate” people from what the cultural-political Left regards as outmoded and repressive ideas about the centrality of procreation and the moral requirement of fidelity in human sexual relationships. Even some leading “conservative” advocates of “same-sex marriage” have announced their moral acceptance of promiscuity; one has gone so far as to proclaim the “spiritual value” of “anonymous sex.” Increasingly, critics of traditional morality are willing explicitly to invoke the authority of ancient pagan civilizations in which practices (including abortion, infanticide, and homosexual conduct) condemned by the Judeo-Christian ethic sometimes flourished.Critics of the Republican stand in defense of marriage and the sanctity of human life — including some within the party — echo the arguments of 19th-century apologists for the relics of barbarism. They accuse pro-life and pro-family Republicans of being “religious fanatics” who disrespect people’s liberty and seek to “impose their values” on others. “If you are against abortion,” they say, “then don’t have an abortion.” They maintain — often disingenuously — that legal recognition of the “marriages” of same-sex partners will not harm or weaken traditional marriages.These arguments fare no better as defenses of human-embryo killing and the redefinition of marriage than they did of slavery and polygamy. Justice requires that all human beings irrespective of race or color, but also irrespective of age, or size, or stage of development, be afforded the protection of the laws. The common good requires that the laws reflect and promote a sound understanding of marriage as uniting one man and one woman in a bond founded upon the bodily communion made possible by their reproductive complementarity.An influential minority in the Republican Party proposes abandoning, or at least soft-pedaling, the party’s commitments to the sanctity of human life and the dignity of marriage and the family. They say that social issues are “too divisive.” They suppose that the easy road to Republican electoral success is as the party of low taxes and low morals. They counsel capitulation to judges who usurp the constitutional authority of the American people and their elected representatives.Let Republicans be mindful of their heritage. It was moral conviction — and the courage to act on moral conviction — that gave birth to the Republican Party and made it grand. Now it is old, but need not be any less grand. By summoning the moral courage that enabled their party to stand proudly against the twin relics of barbarism in the 19th century, Republicans can bring honor upon themselves in the great moral struggles of our own day. –30– Robert P.

        "text": "1856 Republican Convention in Philadelphia\nMenu\nHistoric Posters\nRepublican Philadelphia\nGOP Convention of 1856 in Philadelphia\nRepublican Platform of 1856\nMusical Fund Hall\nOminous talk of pending civil war was rampant, and there was a real feeling of national crisis when Republicans gathered to choose their first presidential candidate at Philadelphia's Musical Fund Hall in mid June.\nViolent civil conflict in \"bleeding Kansas\" was polarizing the nation. In fact, it was the appeasement of slave interests through the Kansas-Nebraska and Fugitive Slave acts that gave birth to the party.\nThe new Republican Party was born in 1854 at a meeting in Ripon, Wisconsin. Abolitionists and those opposed to extension of slavery gathered to protest the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which opened territory to slavery that had been forbidden by the old Missouri Compromise of 1820.\nThe new party was an umbrella that took in members of the rapidly disintegrating Whig Party, abolitionists, Free-Soilers and anti-slavery Democrats.\nIt was certainly a regional party — a party of the North and the West. The Evening Bulletin declared it was \"somewhat astonished\" by the appearance at the convention of delegates from Kentucky, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina. \"We had supposed in accordance with the popular impression that there would be no delegations from any southern or slave states.\"\nThe three-day convention kicked off on June 17. The Bulletin noted: \"Our town is again alive with the bustle and excitement of a grand convention. The hotels are crowded to the highest flight with politicians of many shades.\"\nJames Buchanan: The Last Doughface\nThe Democrats had met earlier in Cincinnati, and after 17 ballots selected Pennsylvanian James Buchanan as its standard-bearer. Buchanan, declared a Richmond, Va., newspaper, \"had never uttered a word which could pain the most sensitive Southern heart.\" The party platform supported \"popular sovereignty\" for settling the question of slavery in new territories. And the party vowed to resist \"in renewing in Congress or out of it, the agitation of the slavery question.\"\nPrior to the Republican convention, city Democrats held a massive rally in front of Independence Hall on June 10. Illinois Sen. Stephen Douglas declared the nation was facing the most important election since 1800.\nThis was a theme heard constantly. The nation was in crisis; the election would determine the outcome. The Evening Bulletin declared: \"It has been correctly remarked that probably a more important convention than the one in question has not been assembled in our city, perhaps not the country, since the days of 1776. The relations of the opposing political parties have aroused a gravity and importance hitherto unknown.\"\nThe convention's presiding officer Col. Henry Lane of Indiana declared, \"We have assembled at the most important crisis in our post-revolutionary history.\"\nDesigned by renowned architect William Strickland, Musical Fund Hall on Locust Street near 8th opened in 1824. It was the site of the convention. It could seat 1,200; it's acoustics were exceptional. However, the year following the GOP convention the concert hall was surpassed by the opening of the grand Academy of Music on Broad Street.\nAbout 600 delegates attended the convention. More than 100 newspaper reporters were seated at tables in the front of the auditorium.\n\"The Trail Blazer,\" John C. Fremont\nThe delegates got right down to business the first day by adopting a platform. The key plank was firm opposition to the extension of slavery. \"It is the duty of Congress to prohibit in the territories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\" The polygamy reference was aimed at the Mormon settlement in Utah territory.\nThen the talk turned to a presidential candidate. The names of Salmon P. Chase of Ohio and U.S. Sen. William H. Seward of New York had been put forward prior to the convention. Both were strong anti-slavery men, both would become important members of Lincoln's cabinet, but neither seemed to have the burning desire or political backing to win the presidency in 1856.\nPennsylvania was solidly behind 71-year-old U.S. Supreme Court Justice John McLean, a cautious, conservative type with a long-standing desire to be president. He didn't seem to be a true antislavery Republican but was popular with old Whigs and American \"Know Nothing\" nativists.\nFremont Campaign Pin\nWithout a doubt, the man with the strongest backing was 43-year-old retired Army officer John C. Fremont. \"The Trail Blazer\" was a national hero for his five courageous crossings of the Rocky Mountains and his leadership role in wresting California from Mexico. He had served briefly as U.S. senator from California. Though born and raised in the South, Fremont opposed slavery. Mostly it was name recognition and not offending any of the party factions that made Fremont the front-runner.\nAn informal ballot on the first day showed Fremont with 369 delegates to McLean's 196. The formal ballot came the next day with Fremont pulling 530 votes to McLean's 37. \"When the vote was announced a scene of the wildest disorder, the most enthusiast excitement and the most decided approbation followed,\" wrote a Bulletin reporter. There were nine cheers for Fremont, nine cheers for California, nine for the union and a final nine cheers for Kansas.\nWilliam Dayton\nThere was real competition for the office of vice president. Fifteen names were put forward in an informal ballot. The leading candidate was William L. Dayton, a former senator from New Jersey.\nThe Public Ledger reported: \"A delegate from Illinois nominated Abraham Lincoln of Illinois. He would only say he was a good fellow, a firm friend of freedom and an old line Whig.\n\"Mr. Archer of Illinois spoke in favor of Mr. Lincoln, whom he had known since childhood and who was a pure patriot. He thought Lincoln would carry Illinois beyond a doubt for Fremont; Illinois would be safe without him but doubly safe with him.\nAbraham Lincoln\n\"Judge Spaulding wished to ask the question, `Can Mr. Lincoln fight?'\"Archer: 'Yes sir, he is a son of Kentucky and a tall man, whichever way you can fix it.'\"\nThe New York Times gave Archer's reply to the question a bit differently: \"Yes! Have I told you he was born in Kentucky? He's strong mentally; he's strong physically. He's strong every way.\"\nOn the informal ballot, Lincoln received 110 votes to Dayton's 259. But in the formal vote, Dayton had it sewed up and Illinois withdrew Lincoln's name from consideration.\nWith the important business done, the delegates and Republican supporters held a mass rally.\n\"On the outside of the hall and immense crowd was gathered. The steps were transformed into a speakers platform and addresses delivered by various speakers,\" said the Bulletin.\nBanners flew everywhere bearing the slogan: Free Speech. Free Press. Free Soil. Free Men. Fremont and Victory.\" An anti-slavery branch of the American (Know Nothing) Party meeting in New York threw its support behind Fremont and Dayton.\nThe site of that first Republican convention, Musical Fund Hall, still stands on Locust Street. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After its demise as a music hall, it served as a union hall, basketball arena and cigar warehouse. It stood empty and forlorn for nearly two decades, dangerously deteriorated and threatened with demolition. Developers purchased the historic derelict in 1980 for $25,000 and restored it as an apartment house.\nGOP Convention of 1872 in Philadelphia >\nTweet"
