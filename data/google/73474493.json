One thing is for sure, zucchini slice is hands-down the national food of the home cook.\nYour lamb, barra and curry may turn up on the menu of a restaurant, but our favourite savoury slice never will. It’s too humble. It just moseys its way into lunch boxes, dinners and even canapes. There’s a reason zucchini slice is taste.com.au’s most popular recipe of all time - it’s simpler than a quiche, tastier than an omelette, and it just works.\nWhy this is our favourite zucchini slice recipe\nThis particular zucchini slice recipe is without doubt the best we’ve tasted (and we’ve tried a lot over the years). Originally submitted by Artarmon Public School in Sydney, it not only has the endorsements of more than 1,000 reviewers, but it’s also been tasted by school kids and the taste team’s tough food critics alike.\nItmanages to pack a big flavour and protein punch with just a handful of ingredients - eggs, zucchini, bacon, cheese and a few other staples- proving it’s totally possible to make a meal that can feed a whole family from pretty much nothing.\nWant to get the best results from this recipe? When we make this zucchini slice (and between us we must've made it hundreds of times) we always ensure we squeeze out the moisture from the zucchini really well to preventtheslice turning out too moist or stodgy. Check out the notes at the bottom of this recipe for more no-fail tips on getting the best results.\nWant tochange up your zucchini slice? Our vegetarian zucchini slice recipe is a great option if you're going meat-free. We've also got plenty of recipe ideas forzucchini slice with a twistto help you experiment with ingredients and flavours.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n2Easy pumpkin soup recipe The beauty of pumpkin soup (and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular) is that it’s so versatile and forgiving. It’s one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, and it’s almost impossible to mess up. We love easy soup recipes, and know our community of home cooks do too.\nThe author, Valli Little, originally created this recipe way back in 2004 and it was passed on to us here at taste.com.au as one of the first pumpkin soup recipes we ever published online. Since then, it’s become one of the most popular pumpkin soup recipes in Australia, with more than 350 rave reviews to date.\nWhat makes this our best easy pumpkin soup recipe?\nIt’s creamy without being heavy, delicately spiced without being spicy, and hearty without being too rich. Pretty much everything we look for in a pumpkin soup (and we’ve tried a lot of pumpkin soup recipes over the years!).\nTo get the most out of this pumpkin soup, ensure you soften the onion and leek until they just start to release some of their juices and flavours, but don’t go so far as to let them caramelise. This gives the soup a subtle sweetness of flavour without any bitterness.\nIf you're not sure how best to cut and prep your pumpkin for your soup, check out our video guide at the bottom of the method steps.\nWe also have a flavourful vegan pumpkin soup recipe for those who prefer a dairy-free soup. Looking for more easy soup recipe ideas? Try our 15-minute chicken and corn noodle soup.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n3Easy fried rice Fried rice is a staple of Aussie takeaway. We love fried rice. And, while we might all have our favourite restaurant that makes Chinese fried rice just the way we like it, satisfying fried rice and egg fried rice is a dish that is easy to replicate at home.\nIn this super simple version we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.\nHave some sesame oil and oyster sauce on hand? Brilliant! (We've listed vegetable oil here, but sesame oil brings extra flavour to your plate, as does a splash of oyster sauce or fish sauce). A great way to use up leftover veggies and protein, fried rice recipes can be bolstered with plenty of healthy ingredients and can easily be made vegetarian or vegan.\nOf course, you can use gluten-free soy sauce (tamari) or low sodium soy sauce instead and still create a flavourful fried rice. You could also jazz things up with kimchi to make a kimchi fried rice. We form an omelette with the eggs to mix through our rice, but you could always create a scrambled eggs texture, if you prefer.\nWhat makes this our best fried rice?\nOur best fried rice recipe contains only a handful of ingredients and ensures making fried rice is simple, which means that kids love it and can have fun cooking fried rice (making it a family-friendly dinner option). It's also a great way to use up any freshly cooked rice that's been leftover from the night before. If you'd like to make a low FODMAP version of this fried rice, check out our tips in the Notes section of this recipe.\nOnce you've mastered how to cook fried rice and egg fried rice, explore more fried rice goodness and check out our best easy fried rice recipes and 15 fabulous fried rice recipes all in one place, including our healthy, oven-baked, one-tray fried rice and this healthy fried rice with egg, for your weeknight convenience!\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n5Impossible quiche Don’t let the name deceive you: this ham and cheese quiche is actually incredibly possible to make. What we love about impossible quiche is that it requires no puff pastry base - you simply mix all the ingredients together, pour into the dish and voila - during cooking a quiche with golden edges forms!\nFor this reason, and the fact it needs only 10 minutes to prep and a handful of ingredients, it’s easily become one of our favourite easy dinners and best lunchbox fillers to make. What’s more, you can make it ahead and freeze it for up to 2 months.\nFor more quiche inspiration, check out our collection of best-ever quiche recipes, and try our sweet take on the impossible quiche with this butterscotch version.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n6Our favourite lasagne Fall in love at first bite with our favourite lasagne. With layer upon layer of rich tomatoey beef mince, pasta, and creamy cheesy sauce, this comforting lasagne recipe is a warm hug on a plate.\nWhat's our secret to the ultimate lasagne?\nThere are many good reasons this particular lasagne recipe has become so beloved. The addition of wine in the red sauce makes it super flavourful, while the layering of pasta with mozzarella makes for the perfect 'cheese pull moment' (watch our video to witness it in action). But if we were to pick one thing that makes this lasagne recipe stand out above all others, it’s the luscious bechamel sauce. A good homemade bechamel base takes time, but it’s worth it for the extra depth of flavour it brings.\nThe best thing about a rich Italian ragu lasagne is that it tastes even better the next day, even when heated in the microwave. This lasagne recipe is also freezer-friendly and will keep for up to 3 months in an airtight container. You can wrap individual portions in freezer wrap, ready to take out for a quick and easy dinner-for-one or to create some lunch envy in the workplace.\nThis lasagne recipe is an absolute favourite among the taste.com.au team (hence the name!), but don’t just take my word for it: our members are raving about it too. One reviewer even said she made it for her husband “who grew up eating lasagna his Italian mother cooked him” (no pressure!) and “he thoroughly enjoyed” it. Fewf (wipes brow). With a 4.5-star rating and multiple rave reviews, it’s safe to say this recipe is now an adopted Aussie classic.\nFeeding a crowd? check out the vegetarian lasagne recipe that even meat lovers will swoon over, and our collection of more delicious lasagne recipes.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n10San choy bau San choy bau is a dish embraced by all ages. Sweet, sour and salty flavours meet tender, crispy and crunchy textures all wrapped up like a present! Our san choy bau recipe brings this Chinese restaurant classic into your own home. Umami-rich oyster and soy sauces flavour soft and juicy pork mince and contrast against the tender-crisp pop of bean sprouts and crunch of peanuts. And who doesn’t love having to eat with your fingers! - Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n11Easy butter chicken What is it about butter chicken (or murgh makhani in Hindi) that makes it loved by children and adults alike? Butter chicken is like a big hug. A must-order item on an Indian restaurant menu, this home-cooked version has all the same complexity of flavour, yet it’s so simple to make yourself. Tender chicken bathes in a tomato sauce flavoured with sweet spices such as cumin, coriander and garam masala, and it’s finished with a generous slug of cream.\nSo what makes our butter chicken recipe such a delicious curry? In any authentic butter chicken, the chicken is left to marinate in a mixture of yoghurt and spices for hours before cooking. The yoghurt makes the chicken super tender, while the spices penetrate it and give it much more depth of flavour. Of course, butter chicken sauce isn’t made from just butter, it's made up of a beautiful blend of rich ingredients, the yoghurt from the marinade, stock, tomato and cream.\nI recommend serving this version of butter chicken the traditional way with steamed basmati rice and naan.\nIf you love butter chicken, try out butter chicken pie, butter chicken pizza and creamy butter chicken served in a crispy roti.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n12Pea & ham soup Hear me out when I suggest pea and ham soup is the Ugg Boot of the soup world. It may not look the prettiest, but it provides warmth and comfort like nothing else. The holy trinity of onion, carrot and celery forms the aromatic base for this perfect pea and ham soup recipe.Tiny split peas slowly break down in water flavoured with the aromatics and an umami-packed ham hock.\nThe secret ingredient here? Time. Simmering for more than 2 hours allows the hock to soften until fork-tender and falling from the bone. It also allows the starches in the peas to be released into the soup, creating a creamy taste and texture. This pea and ham soup is so tasty it’s enough to make you yearn for winter at any time of the year. You can also pop this set-and-forget slow cooker pea and ham soup on and come home to a warming bowl of ready-made soup. Seeking more soup ideas? We’ve gathered together 67 warming winter soup recipes that aren’t pumpkin based.\nAdditional recipe notes by Alison Adams - Food Writer and Recipe Tester\n13Australia's top-rated spaghetti carbonara recipe We throw tradition to the wind with our speedy spaghetti carbonara recipe, with some sneaky shortcuts for time-poor cooks. It may taste exactly like the real deal, but this carbonara has some secrets behind its glossy surface, proving some rules are just begging to be broken.\nWhat's the secret behind this easy spaghetti carbonara recipe?\nBeloved my many, our easy carbonara recipe is one of Australia’s most popular recipes, and we know exactly why it's become the stuff of weeknight legend. We do the thing your nonna told you not to: we add cream. And yet, although it breaks from the traditional Italian recipe, it’s all for a delicious reason. We promise. Traditional carbonara recipes require a degree of technique (for example, adding ingredients at just the right temperature and time) and quality (read: expensive) ingredients, which just aren’t ideal for regular weeknights. That’s why we like to add thickened cream to our carbonara recipe with cream. A cheaper supermarket ingredient that ensures a velvety, indulgent sauce that will rival a restaurant-made spaghetti carbonara, a splash of cream means dinner's ready in 12 minutes! This carbonara recipe is one of the quickest you’ll come across. Here's to making weeknights simpler (without compromising on flavour). Go on, break the rules. We won't tell.\nHere's some other old-school favourites we've made simpler. More time to spare?

But this episode made me finally see what the writers were going for and it made me really love the time jump for where it has put these characters now. I love Noho Hank becoming a kindof villain, he reminded me of Pagan Min. Barry kind of took a backseat but Sally and Cousino's stories are really great. It really feels like it is really clear on what note the writers want to end the show and it's been one of the best shows on in the past couple of years. Can't wait for the finale, this felt like the last 2 episodes of Twin Peaks: The Return.helpful•112Marco_TontodonatiMay 25, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateMay 21, 2023 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishSpanishSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime30 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalAspect ratio1.78 : 116:9 HDRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the French language plot outline for a nice meal (2023)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
