To add longevity to the objects or buildings being built using clay, baked clay or terracotta came into vogue, and being lighter in nature has been widely used for architectural purposes across the world. In West Bengal, while baked clay objects have been in regular use from ancient times, exquisite terracotta temples gained popularity during the Hindu Revival period under the Krishna bhakti movement that lasted for three centuries, 16th – 19th century CE. While West Bengal temples always bring to mind the distinctive chala styled roofed structures with beautiful terracotta plaques on walls and pillars, it was not so during the ancient and early medieval times.From the various temples that still remain, it is evident that stone was the primary material of construction during the ancient and early medieval eras (mainly the Gupta and Pala-Sena era). The use of terracotta in West Bengal started in ancient times with the making of objects used in daily lives, such as, cooking utensils, jars, toys, and seals, to small decorative plaques; and finally evolved into being used for temple constructions from the early modern era in 15th-16th century CE. Stone as a building material got replaced mainly because of the easier availability of clay in a state that has an abundance of clayey soil from its many rivers.Also ReadLoss to Maldives could be $25-50 million: Hospitality playersTravel: A City called DarjeelingAyodhya Ram Mandir to be ready in three years; Rajasthan makes highest contribution in Samarpan driveStatue of Unity to lose its tallest statue crown to one of these two statues in Ayodhya and Mumbai, find outWhen discussing Bengal terracotta temples, the first name that automatically comes to mind are the famous ones at Bishnupur.Jor Bangla or Gangeswar temple (Photo by Ajoy Konar)However, West Bengal is scattered with many such beautiful terracotta temples that are spread across the state; though, sadly, many of them are in a dilapidated condition owing to complete neglect and apathy. Among the rather unique terracotta temples of this state are the Char Bangla temple and the Gangeswar temple, both situated in Baranagar.Baranagar, once the capital of Rani Bhavani of Natore (1716-1795) falls in the Murshidabad district. Under the Rani, Natore was at that time considered among the wealthiest of all Bengal zamindaris, with an annual income of 1.5 crores, a part of which the queen donated towards various charitable causes. While shifting her capital to the western side of the river Ganges, Rani Bhavani decided to build 108 Siva temples in Baranagar, with the aim of turning the place into a second Varanasi. Built between 1753 to1760, many of the temples built by the queen are now lost owing to a change in the course of the river Bhagirathi that engulfed the structures. Among the ones that survived are a cluster of four two-chala temples known commonly as the Char Bangla temple, and the other is a jor bangla temple known as Gangeswar temple, and both are under the purview of the ASI.Char Bangla Temple (Photo by Ajoy Konar )The Char bangla temple stands on a 1.5 feet high base, with its four temples showing two roofed Bengal chala (do chala), thus giving it the name of Char bangla, a unique style not seen elsewhere. There are three doors to each temple, with three shiv-lingas in the sanctums. Of the four, three temples share a common platform, while the northern temple stands separate. The northern temple of the Char Bangla is the richest in terracotta ornamentation, reflecting different episodes of Puranic stories, stories from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, narratives from the Krishna-leela, different forms of the mother goddess, and daily scenarios from the village lives. Among the different plaques on the northern temple there is a beautiful depiction of Shiva sitting on a platform, while his two devotees Nandi and Bhringi are shown busy preparing hookah and bhaang for him. The western temple has a beautiful central arch depicting Ravana. The eastern temple is also unique as it shows stucco works, unlike theterracotta work seen in the others; however, the stucco work was made by etching method, which is found elsewhere too.Char Bangla Temple (Photo by Ajoy Konar )Also Read | Bungee Jumping comes to Goa! Here’s one more reason to visit India’s beach paradise About a kilometer away from the Char Bangla stands the Jor Bangla temple also known as the Gangeswar temple. In Bengali, jor means a pair and the Gangeswar Mandir shows two identical ek-bangla mandir style, which gives it the name Jor Bangla. The temple complex comprises of three temples dedicated to Shiva, namely the Gangeswar, Kastureswar, and Nageswar temples. These temples show intricate terracotta ornamentation and rest on three archways. Unlike the Char Bangla temple, in the Gangeswar temple, the spaces above the arches noticeably depict nothing from the epics or Puranas, but show only horses and other floral patterns. However, the temple pillars and walls have exquisite terracotta plaques that depict stories from the Ramayana and Krishnaleela. On one of its pillars is depicted on terracotta the story of Ram offering his eye to goddess Durga. Here the mother goddess is with innumerable hands, which is a rarity in temple sculptures.Travel tips: Murshidabad lies about 220 km away from Kolkata and is well connected by trains and roads. The nearest railway station is Azimganj with direct train connections from both Howrah and Sealdah stations. There are many SC and non-AC standard hotels in Azimganj and Jiaganj if one wishes to stay. The best time to explore these temples is during the winter months.(The author is a well-known travel writer.

But did you know there is a whole temple complex made of terracotta in Bishnupur, West Bengal?Radha Madhab Temple, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaIt’s hard to imagine an entire holy city built of terracotta, but visit Bishnupur in West Bengal and feast your eyes on a temple town built purely of clay and brick. Bishnupur, 139 km from Kolkata, was built by the Malla kings who ruled a part of West Bengal between Burdwan and Purulia. The temples are dedicated to Lord Vishnu – hence the name ‘Bishnupur’ in local parlance – and were built across 700 years, from the 10th to the 17th centuries.Jor Bangla Temple, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThe Bishnupur temple complex consists of 20 temples. The first of these, the Mrinmayee Temple, was built in 997 CE by King Jagat Malla.The temples of Bishnupur reflect the local architecture of Bengal and most of them were built between 1622 CE and 1758 CE.Pancha Ratna Temple, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThe unavailability of stone in the flood plains of Bengal probably led to the extensive use of terracotta, but it is a testimony to the skill of the sutradharas, or the local temple builders, that these temples survive to this day!Rasmancha Temple, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThe Rasmancha temple is unique, with its unusual elongated pyramidical tower surrounded by hut-shaped turrets, which was very typical of Bengali roof structures of the time.Madan Mohan Temple, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThe Madanmohan temple built by King Durjana Singh Deva, has a square flat-roofed building with carved cornices, surmounted by a pinnacle. Impressive carvings on the walls of Madanmohan temple depict scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Puranas.Sculptural details, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThe images you see etched on the Bishnupur temples are also quite unique. This could have been because the artists who worked on the temple complex were illiterate and had no access to the epics and the stories associated with it, which were in Sanskrit. Their only access to this repository was through the works of local Bengali poets, who wrote dramas and ballads.Intricately carved pillars, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaThepoetic licence they enjoyed allowed them to weave in new episodes andinterpretations based on local customs and traditions, thus bringing new facetsto the stories from the Mahabharataand Ramayana and also the art ofthese temples.Intricately carved temple columnsOrnate carvings on the temples, Bishnupur by Team LHILive History IndiaVisit Bishnupur today and it is hard to imagine that this was once a great centre of art and culture. The Malla kings were patrons of Vaishanavism and invited scholars and artists from all over to Bishnupur. Much of this richness is reflected in the terracotta temples that stand tall even today.Credits: All mediaThe story featured may in some cases have been created by an independent third party and may not always represent the views of the institutions, listed below, who have supplied the content.Live History IndiaStories from Live History IndiaOnline ExhibitViratnagar StupaLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitKandhar - The Seat of RashtrakutasLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitAchipur & India’s First Chinese SettlerLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitUndavalli Caves - Where Faiths Converge Live History IndiaOnline ExhibitThe Mughal Gardens at PinjoreLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitMysterious Horsemen of Jammu & KashmirLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitThe Palaces of DeegLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitHarwan MonasteryLive History IndiaOnline ExhibitChampaner - Gujarat's Abandoned CapitalLive History IndiaExplore moreRelated themeWonders of IndiaA showcase of India's finest cultural treasures.

Among other things, the town is well-known for its terracotta temples, extensively embellished with carved and moulded terracotta decorations made from the locally available laterite clay. These temples are associated with the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith, dating back to seventeenth century.Apart from its temple architecture, Bishnupur is also well-known for the craftsmanship of its terracotta figurines, pottery, jewellery, and other decorative artefacts. In recent years, artisans from Panchmura, a Bankura town not too far from Bishnupur, have also been churning out thousands of terracotta panels emulating the bas-reliefs of the terracotta temples of Bishnupur. These panels not only serve as mementos and curios for tourists to carry back home, but have also been increasingly used to decorate the facades of newer constructions, both religious and secular (Dasgupta 2000).Origin and HistoryThe origins of Bishnupur as a settlement are somewhat shrouded in mystery. Inscriptions dating back to Samudra Gupta’s period have referred to the locale, which came to be known later in the tenth century CE as Bishnupur, a small kingdom governed by local rulers who paid tribute to the Guptas. This was followed by a long period of obscurity, when the land shifted to and fro between being a minor independent principality and a feudatory state. Bishnupur eventually became the capital of the kings of the Malla dynasty, who ruled over a region known as Mallabhum, covering modern day Bankura, Onda, Bishnupur, Kotulpur, and Indas, till the first half of the twentieth century. During the reign of the Malla kings, which can be traced back to the seventh century CE, the region known as Mallabhum stretched further north to Damin-i-Koh in the Santhal Parganas, Midnapore in the south, Bardhaman in the east, and parts of Chota Nagpur in the west. It was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, during the reign of Hambir Malla Dev, also known as Bir Hambir, the 49th king of the Malla dynasty, that Bishnupur began to draw interest from its neighbouring territories, both politically and culturally.The origins of Bishnupur as a religious and cultural hub with its distinctive temple architecture is closely tied to the Gaudiya Vaishnava devotional movement of the sixteenth century in eastern India and Bengal in particular (then known as Gaud or Gaur). The bhakti saint and social reformer, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533), founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism, a brand of spiritualism marked by an emotive and intimate devotion to the Hindu god Krishna, the central deity of the tradition. Vrindavan—the mythical site where Krishna spent his youth, believed to be located in the woods by the river Yamuna in north India—held a profound fascination for devotees of the Vaishnava faith. Pika Ghosh argues that Bishnupur’s emergence as an important centre for Gaudiya Vaishnava is tied to the transformation of the forests of Bishnupur into a hallowed centre in an attempt to recreate a ‘Gupta Vrindavan’, that is, a hidden Vrindavan in Bishnupur (Ghosh 2002).According to Gaudiya Vaishnava literature, Chaitanya picked six disciples who came to be called the Goswamis and established them at Vrindavan over the course of the sixteenth century. At his behest, the six Goswamis, who were the second generation of Gaudiya Vaishnava leaders, compiled the body of theological texts that had come to define their religious tradition. In the wake of Chaitanya’s demise and the waning popularity of the Gaudiya Vaishnava movement, the Goswamis chose Srinivasa Acharya, slated to become the next Gaudiya Vaishnava leader, to redeploy their energies in Bengal. He was provided a cartload of manuscripts inscribed with the essential principles of the tradition to help him accomplish this task. While travelling through Bishnupur, Srinivas lost these precious manuscripts placed under his charge. On tracing them to the local chief, Bir Hambir of the Malla dynasty, he visited Bishnupur and electrified the court by astutely narrating and elucidating on episodes from Krishna’s life. The raja was so deeply moved by Srinivas’s passion for Krishna that he fell at his feet and confessed to having arranged the theft of the manuscripts, mistaking them for worldly treasures. In a bid to make amends, Bir Hambir entreated Srinivasa and his fellow devotees to stay on and granted them the land and resources to create a sacred centre for Vaishnava devotion in the region.This narrative, recovered from various Gaudiya Vaishnava texts, draws attention to Bishnupur’s political patronage of the Gaudiya Vaishnava faith, which helped the order flourish in this region and establish a seat of culture and religion based on the Vaishnava tradition. This alliance with the political authorities of Bishnupur meant that Gaudiya Vaishnavism would have a powerful influence on the distinctive styles of art, craftsmanship, and temple artistry that were on the verge of surfacing in the region. The consequent proliferation of temples in this region over the next century and a half, which British site surveys and administrative reports of the mid-eighteenth century estimate to be between 150 and 450 in number, is probably what gave Bishnupur its reputation as a religious centre (Ghosh 2002).Terracotta Temples in BishnupurStructure and DesignSimilar to the contouring of Vrindavan that had been carried out in the sixteenth century by Chaitanya and the Gaudiya Vaishnava devotees Pika Ghosh writes in Tales, Tanks and Templesthat Gaudiya Vaishnava literature from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries credit Chaitanya with reviving Vrindavan and restoring it as the abode of Krishna’s divine play. This divine play, as described in the tenth century Bhagavata Purana, a text regarded as revelation in the tradition, is believed by Vaishnavas to be reenacted perpetually in these groves.BibliographyDasgupta, Chittaranjan. 2000.
