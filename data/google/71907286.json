She was born in Spokane on April 16, 1960, to William and Helen Waymire.She attended John R. Rogers High School in the Hillyard neighborhood, but dropped out of school prior to graduating. The only yearbook photo of Ruth, which is also the only known picture of her on the internet, is her school portrait from her sophomore year.Ruth's parents divorced in 1978. While her father remarried just weeks after the divorce was finalized, Ruth, her younger sister, and her mother moved in with relatives. It is not known what kind of relationship Ruth had with her, father, but neither she nor her sister were mentioned in his obituary when he died in 1991.Ruth married 21-year-old John A. Atkinson on September 22, 1979; they divorced in 1981. She then married David L. Vaughan, 36, on June 12, 1981.On the afternoon of Wednesday, June 20, 1984, a dismembered female body was found by two fishermen in the Spokane River, near the Spokane Falls Community College campus. The woman's head, feet and hands had been severed and were missing. Investigators were unable to identify who she was and the case went cold. She was buried as a Jane Doe in an unmarked grave at Fairmount Memorial Park. On Sunday, April 19, 1998 — nearly 14 years later — a skull was found buried in a vacant lot in South Spokane that was being excavated. A few years later, DNA matched the skull to the 1984 Jane Doe — now known by detectives as \"Millie\" — but Millie's identity remained a mystery for another 25 years.In 2021, Spokane Police Sgt. Zac Storment submitted biological material taken from Millie's remains to Othram Inc., a Texas-based forensic genealogy company that has cracked dozens of cold cases since its founding in 2018, in hopes that Millie could be identified. Genealogical DNA databases helped narrow the search, and Ruth's sister, now living in the Midwest, provided a genetic sample.On February 17, 2023 — 38 years, 7 months, and 28 days after her body was discovered, Millie was identified: she was Ruth Waymire. Through all this time, Ruth hadn't been reported as missing because she and her sister had lost touch after their mother died, and at the time of her death, Ruth was apparently living a \"vagabond lifestyle.\"While Ruth has finally been identified, the identity of her murderer is still unknown.It is my hope that everyone who loved Ruth and wondered where she's been the past 40 years will now find closure. I also hope that she will one day receive a beautiful headstone — not just to mark where her resting place is, but as a marble, slate and granite monument to the person that was Ruth Belle Waymire, a woman who lived, loved, mattered, and deserved so much more out of life.Most of all, though, now that she's been found, I hope Ruth can finally rest in a still, tranquil peace that eluded her in life.∼'No one deserves not to have a name'Ruth Waymire hoped to be first of many Jane Does identified through genetic genealogyBy Emma EpperlyThe Spokesman-ReviewWind whipped through Fairmount Memorial Park on a rainy April afternoon as two black-clad figures looked for a grave.It took 20 minutes, several looks at a map and a phone call to a groundskeeper before Spokane Police Sgt. Zac Storment and Death Investigator Nicole Hamada stood over a patch of grass, no marking in sight, where Ruth Belle Waymire was laid to rest.For nearly 40 years, no one knew who the woman in the unmarked grave was.In March, her identity was uncovered through genetic genealogy.Things had been fairly normal for the Waymire sisters — Ruth and Deborah — during their early childhood. Their parents were married, and their mom stayed at home while dad worked as a furnace operator.When Ruth was a teenager and Deborah was in grade school, their parents divorced.The girls lived with their mom and their father provided for them, Deborah recalled, until he got remarried. During that time, their mother was diagnosed with cancer and spent a lot of time in the hospital.Despite their tumultuous home life, Deborah said she always knew she could count on her sister to stick up for her.\"We were real close, me and my sister,\" she said.One time, Deborah was getting bullied on the school bus, to the point that a classmate hit her over the head with some books. Ruth stepped in and put the bully in her place. Deborah had no problems with her after that.When their mother died in 1982, Ruth and Deborah were largely on their own.Both dropped out of school. Ruth got married as a teenager, but the relationship soured after a couple of months, Deborah said.Ruth then started bringing a dark-haired boy around, Deborah said. They quickly married and decided to move, despite Deborah's concerns that Ruth really didn't know her new husband all that well. But Ruth was confident that she could take care of herself.\"I never saw her again,\" Deborah said.Spokane County Medical Examiner Veena Singh is hopeful that the latest technological advance, genetic genealogy, could finally be the key to identifying more remains.\"The first step to investigating anyone's death is figuring out who they are,\" Sing said.The medical examiner's office has about 30 unidentified sets of remains dating back as far as the 1960s. Their identities have eluded investigators for decades, despite numerous advances in technology, including the creation of a national database called CODIS that consists of DNA taken from people charged with or convicted of crimes.The medical examiner's office used nearly $350,000 of American Rescue Plan funds intended for public safety measures to send the specimens out for analysis that would allow them to use genealogy to identify people. So far, they've sent about half their cases to Othram, a lab that does both the specific DNA analysis and genealogy that encompass genetic genealogy.Hamada, who started as a death investigator at the medical examiner's office in 2021, was always interested in working on cases of unidentified remains.One of the first things she did when settling in to her new office was hang up digital renderings of unidentified people.\"(Ruth's) re-creation photo went up in my office as a reminder that no one deserves not to have a name,\" Hamada said. \"So this case stuck with me from the very beginning.\"When the grant funds came through, Hamada began learning how to do genealogy herself, building family trees in hopes of stretching the funds further by only having to pay for the DNA analysis in the future.She had become interested in the technology when she interned in Snohomish County in 2019 and attended the trial of William Earl Talbot II, who killed Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook in 1987. Talbot's conviction was the first using genetic genealogy.Once in Spokane, the Ruth Waymire case quickly drew Hamada's attention.\"I have always wondered how a young female falls off the radar and no one seems to know anything about her,\" Hamada said.The results from Othram turned up two names: Ruth and Deborah Waymire. But they weren't totally sure they had the right family lineage because the women's father had been remarried and possibly had other children.After months of making family trees and researching, Hamada discovered the women's father didn't have other children. They began looking for Deborah, but she was hard to find, with marriages and name changes.Investigators finally located her in Oklahoma. Deborah remembers officers showing up to her door and asking her to take a DNA test.She had always wondered about her sister and what happened to her, but never really knew how to find her, Deborah said.The DNA came back as a match, giving the medical examiner's office their first identification through genetic genealogy.When Storment called to tell Deborah they had identified her sister and she was dead, it unleashed a flurry of grief.\"Oh my God, I was devastated,\" Deborah said. \"It was like a sledgehammer hitting me in the chest.\"Things only got worse when Storment detailed how Ruth died.Two fisherman discovered a nude, decapitated body on the south shore of the Spokane River on June 20, 1984. The woman didn't match the description of any known missing people at the time.Then in April 1998, a skull was found in a vacant lot at Seventh Avenue and Sherman Street. Tips and leads poured in after the discovery, but none lead to an identification.A few years later, the skull and torso were matched through then-cutting-edge DNA technology.But little progress was made in discovering Ruth's identity until last year with genetic genealogy.Finding out her sister's death was so violent, and that she was never even reported missing, devastated Deborah.\"Just threw in the river like trash,\" Deborah said angrily.Deborah, now 59, had her own struggles in the years after her sister left. As a teenager, she moved around Central Washington, working wherever she could.She settled in Wenatchee and married. She had two children before divorcing her husband.Deborah later moved to Oklahoma, where she now lives on disability. She is estranged from her sons.After decades of wondering what happened to her sister, Deborah wants closure: \"I want to know who did this to my sister.\"When investigators announced they had identified Ruth, it came with a plea for tips.Anyone who knew her, perhaps even in passing at school, might be able to tell Storment a bit about her personality.At the time of her death, Ruth was married to Trampas D.L. Vaughan, who died near Sacramento in 2017.Storment hoped for tips about Vaughan or the couple's marriage. Ruth had given birth a year or two before to her death, but it's unclear what happened to the baby.Investigators hoped tips from the public would help fill in the gaps, but hardly anyone called.So Hamada and Storment did the one thing they could to give Deborah a small bit of that closure she so desired: they went to find Ruth's grave.There wasn't much there, just yellow grass dotted with pine cones. Storment knelt to drive a green plastic vase into the ground.He choked up, realizing the vase and vibrant flowers served as the only marker for Ruth\"This case will stick with me forever because it's just shocking to the core,\" Storment said. \"What happened to her is beyond belief. Spokane is a great place to live, and for things like this to happen and to go unanswered are shocking and unacceptable.\"—From The Spokesman-Review; Wednesday, May 17, 2023∼'This case will stick with me forever': Spokane detectives pleading for tips to solve 1984 cold caseBy Hayley GuenthnerKHQ-TVSPOKANE, Wash. — There are some crimes that are so heinous, those who spend their careers trying to solve them know the facts will never leave them.\"This case will stick with me forever, yeah, for the rest of my life,\" said Sgt. Zac Storment.He's talking about the 1984 murder of a woman who went unidentified for 39 years. Forensic genetic genealogy led them to the victim's name, Ruth Belle Waymire. She was just 24 years old when detectives believe she was killed, dismembered and dumped in multiple locations.\"Spokane is a great place to live, and for things like this to happen and to go unanswered are shocking and unacceptable,\" Storment said.The case began in June 1984, when two fishermen found the decapitated, nude remains of a young woman in the Spokane River. By 1998, the victim's skull was also found in a vacant lot near 7th and Sherman. A positive ID for Ruth took nearly four decades, but the identity of whoever was responsible for her horrific death still remains a mystery.\"It is just shocking to the core,\" Storment said. \"What happened to her is beyond belief. \"Everyone deserves to have a name,\" added Medical Examiner Death Investigator Nicole Hamada.And because of the tireless efforts from Storment, Hamada, and others, she finally does. Even though it took until 2023, Storment says it wasn't from a lack of trying by officers spanning decades. In 2001, SPD exhumed the victim's body for DNA evidence.\"To begin the modern investigation on Spokane's Millie,\" he said.Storment says 'Millie' because that's what the victim was referred to by media and investigators alike for years. A former detective's daughter came up with the name, and it stuck. That was until Millie officially became Ruth, thanks to rapidly advancing DNA technology.\"Ultimately, forensic genetic genealogy is the only way this case gets solved,\" Storment said. \"Without that, we wouldn't be here today.\"With the help of the company Othram Inc, the same company that helped them solve the murder of Candy Rogers, investigators were able to track down a probable sister of the victim. A sample from Deborah Waymire confirmed it, launching a new chapter of work for Storment.\"As far as what we know about Ruth, she lived in what we call the Mead area now on Yale Road,\" he said. \"She went to a grade school that no longer exists. She and her sister moved in with family when their parents divorced.\"That sister, Deborah, said the news of what happened to her big sister has been as heartbreaking as it is disturbing.\"She had no clothes on, she was left floating in the river like trash,\" Deborah said. \"The way she got killed (the news of it) felt like a sledgehammer hit me. I don't know how someone could do that to another human being.\"The sisters lost contact after their mother died in the early 1980s. Their father is deceased, too.\"The only family I had was my sister,\" Deborah said.Storment says Ruth attended Rogers High School. Deborah said she dropped out before graduating.\"She was protective (of me),\" Deborah said.Ruth had been divorced and was remarried at the time of her death to a man named Trampas D.L. Vaughan. Deborah had never met him. Investigators also believe Ruth gave birth to at least one baby roughly a year before she was killed.Deborah said she thought of her sister over the years but felt she had no way to try to track her down.\"For the Spokane community, this has been a cold case; it's something that we look back on with 39 years' distance. For her sister, this just happened,\" Storment said. \"She's just now aware her sister has died and found out that it happened in a very gruesome manner.\"Storment and Hamada honored Deborah's request late last week. She no longer lives in the area.\"The family asked we put flowers here, at least to mark the spot,\" he said.That for now, at least, is nameless. But all involved in the case hope there's a way for the community to come together to give Ruth the grave marker she deserves.\"It would be a blessing if they did,\" Deborah said.\"Just to kind of see that she's in an unmarked grave and knowing that she's been unidentified for so long, it's just kind of overwhelming,\" Hamada said.Like the investigation into finding whoever put Ruth here.\"The right person's out there that knows, and I just need to speak with them,\" Storment said.Storment is asking anyone who even knew Ruth to call him. He said any background information at all could be extremely helpful in his investigation.

The woman didn't match the description of any missing people at the time.Then in April 1998, a skull was found in a vacant lot at Seventh Avenue and Sherman Street. Tips and leads poured in after the discovery, but an identification was elusive.Without the woman's real name, police dubbed her \"Millie\" after Spokane police Detective Don Giese's daughter told her father that \"no one deserves to not have a name.\"Three years later, through then-cutting edge DNA technology, the skull was matched to the torso found in 1984. The DNA was uploaded into the Combined DNA Index System, but it didn't find a match.Investigators continued to revisit the case over the years. In 2002, forensic drawings and a facial reconstruction were done. In 2007, the case information was uploaded into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System's database.Last fall, not long after genetic genealogy helped solve the cold case killing of Candy Rogers in Spokane, Spokane police Sgt. Zac Storment sent \"Millie's\" DNA to Othram Inc. for analysis.Genetic genealogy uses a special type of DNA analysis to compare unknown DNA profiles to profiles in publicly available databases. Then genealogists build family trees from often distant connections, like cousins or uncles, to help identify people.The genealogy investigation narrowed \"Millie's\" identity down to one of two sisters. Investigators were able to find one of the sisters living in the Midwest. Detectives contacted her and she provided DNA, which confirmed \"Millie\" to be Ruth Belle Waymire.Waymire, who was 24 at the time of her death, grew up in Spokane. She attended Rogers High School, living with her mother and sister after her parents' divorce.After Waymire's mother died, the sisters went separate ways and lost contact. Waymire was never reported missing and \"was described to have a \"vagabond lifestyle,\" spending time in Spokane and Wenatchee, according to the news release.At the time of her death, Waymire was married to Trampas D.L. Vaughan, her second husband. She had given birth a year or two before her death, according to autopsy results. Investigators also have not found any records of Waymire's child or children.Spokane police have yet to identify Waymire's killer. Vaughan, who served time in prison in Iowa, died in California, near Sacramento, in 2017.There's no divorce record between the couple, and investigators have not ruled him out as a suspect.Waymire's first husband, who lives in Spokane, is not a suspect and is cooperating with the investigation, according to police.Spokane police hope that people who knew Waymire, her husbands or children will contact police with any information they might have. Tips can be called into Crime Check at (509) 456-2233.—From The Spokesman-Review; Wednesday, March 29, 2023 ∼Woman's dismembered body discovered in riverAn autopsy will be performed Friday on the remains of a woman whose dismembered body was found in the Spokane River Wednesday afternoon, police said today.Investigators said the unidentified woman's head, hands and feet were severed and have not been located.Two fishermen spotted the nude body floating near the west side of the river below the Spokane Falls Community College campus about 3:30 p.m. A Fire Department boat crew recovered the body about 20 feet from shore.Detectives said the killer dismembered the victim in an obvious attempt to prevent identification.\"It'll take a lot of work to determine who this (the victim) might be,\" said Lt. Gene McGougan.Coroner Dexter Amend said he has asked Dr. Don Reay, a forensic pathologist from the King County Medical Examiners Office, to perform the autopsy.McGougan said the pathologist will be looking for any history of broken bones or surgeries which could be compared with medical records of missing persons.Amend has asked detectives to make a special effort to find the body parts before Reay arrives.The coroner said he would examine the remains this afternoon and take samples of vital fluids for testing.It is difficult to tell how long the body was in the river before it was discovered because the cold water slows decomposition, Amend said.Detective Sgt. Mike Schmidt said this murder does not appear to be connected to the slaying of another woman whose body was discovered earlier this week in Fernan Lake near Coeur d'Alene. —From the Spokane Chronicle; Thursday afternoon, June 21, 1984∼Woman's mutilated body found in riverThe nude body of a woman was found Wednesday afternoon in the Spokane River below the Spokane Falls Community College campus, and police said the death is being investigated as a homicide.The body, which had not been identified by late Wednesday night, was spotted about 3:30 p.m. by two fishermen. A Fire Department boat crew recovered the body about 20 feet from shore.Police Lt. Gerald Hickman said the body had been mutilated, but would not be more specific. He said the body had been in the river a couple of days.A specific description of the woman was not disclosed by police, except that she was white. Hickman said her description did not match that of any women reported missing.—From The Spokesman-Review; Thursday morning, June 21, 1984\nNot much is known publicly about Ruth Waymire's difficult and tragically short life. She was born in Spokane on April 16, 1960, to William and Helen Waymire.She attended John R. Rogers High School in the Hillyard neighborhood, but dropped out of school prior to graduating. The only yearbook photo of Ruth, which is also the only known picture of her on the internet, is her school portrait from her sophomore year.Ruth's parents divorced in 1978.

Their father is deceased, too.\"The only family I had was my sister,\" Deborah said.Storment says Ruth attended Rogers High School. Deborah said she dropped out before graduating.\"She was protective (of me),\" Deborah said.Ruth had been divorced and was remarried at the time of her death to a man named Trampas D.L. Vaughan. Deborah had never met him. Investigators also believe Ruth gave birth to at least one baby roughly a year before she was killed.Deborah said she thought of her sister over the years but felt she had no way to try to track her down.\"For the Spokane community, this has been a cold case; it's something that we look back on with 39 years' distance. For her sister, this just happened,\" Storment said. \"She's just now aware her sister has died and found out that it happened in a very gruesome manner.\"Storment and Hamada honored Deborah's request late last week. She no longer lives in the area.\"The family asked we put flowers here, at least to mark the spot,\" he said.That for now, at least, is nameless. But all involved in the case hope there's a way for the community to come together to give Ruth the grave marker she deserves.\"It would be a blessing if they did,\" Deborah said.\"Just to kind of see that she's in an unmarked grave and knowing that she's been unidentified for so long, it's just kind of overwhelming,\" Hamada said.Like the investigation into finding whoever put Ruth here.\"The right person's out there that knows, and I just need to speak with them,\" Storment said.Storment is asking anyone who even knew Ruth to call him. He said any background information at all could be extremely helpful in his investigation.

The woman didn't match the description of any missing people at the time.Then in April 1998, a skull was found in a vacant lot at Seventh Avenue and Sherman Street. Tips and leads poured in after the discovery, but an identification was elusive.Without the woman's real name, police dubbed her \"Millie\" after Spokane police Detective Don Giese's daughter told her father that \"no one deserves to not have a name.\"Three years later, through then-cutting edge DNA technology, the skull was matched to the torso found in 1984. The DNA was uploaded into the Combined DNA Index System, but it didn't find a match.Investigators continued to revisit the case over the years. In 2002, forensic drawings and a facial reconstruction were done. In 2007, the case information was uploaded into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System's database.Last fall, not long after genetic genealogy helped solve the cold case killing of Candy Rogers in Spokane, Spokane police Sgt. Zac Storment sent \"Millie's\" DNA to Othram Inc. for analysis.Genetic genealogy uses a special type of DNA analysis to compare unknown DNA profiles to profiles in publicly available databases. Then genealogists build family trees from often distant connections, like cousins or uncles, to help identify people.The genealogy investigation narrowed \"Millie's\" identity down to one of two sisters. Investigators were able to find one of the sisters living in the Midwest. Detectives contacted her and she provided DNA, which confirmed \"Millie\" to be Ruth Belle Waymire.Waymire, who was 24 at the time of her death, grew up in Spokane. She attended Rogers High School, living with her mother and sister after her parents' divorce.After Waymire's mother died, the sisters went separate ways and lost contact. Waymire was never reported missing and \"was described to have a \"vagabond lifestyle,\" spending time in Spokane and Wenatchee, according to the news release.At the time of her death, Waymire was married to Trampas D.L. Vaughan, her second husband. She had given birth a year or two before her death, according to autopsy results. Investigators also have not found any records of Waymire's child or children.Spokane police have yet to identify Waymire's killer. Vaughan, who served time in prison in Iowa, died in California, near Sacramento, in 2017.There's no divorce record between the couple, and investigators have not ruled him out as a suspect.Waymire's first husband, who lives in Spokane, is not a suspect and is cooperating with the investigation, according to police.Spokane police hope that people who knew Waymire, her husbands or children will contact police with any information they might have. Tips can be called into Crime Check at (509) 456-2233.—From The Spokesman-Review; Wednesday, March 29, 2023 ∼Woman's dismembered body discovered in riverAn autopsy will be performed Friday on the remains of a woman whose dismembered body was found in the Spokane River Wednesday afternoon, police said today.Investigators said the unidentified woman's head, hands and feet were severed and have not been located.Two fishermen spotted the nude body floating near the west side of the river below the Spokane Falls Community College campus about 3:30 p.m. A Fire Department boat crew recovered the body about 20 feet from shore.Detectives said the killer dismembered the victim in an obvious attempt to prevent identification.\"It'll take a lot of work to determine who this (the victim) might be,\" said Lt. Gene McGougan.Coroner Dexter Amend said he has asked Dr. Don Reay, a forensic pathologist from the King County Medical Examiners Office, to perform the autopsy.McGougan said the pathologist will be looking for any history of broken bones or surgeries which could be compared with medical records of missing persons.Amend has asked detectives to make a special effort to find the body parts before Reay arrives.The coroner said he would examine the remains this afternoon and take samples of vital fluids for testing.It is difficult to tell how long the body was in the river before it was discovered because the cold water slows decomposition, Amend said.Detective Sgt. Mike Schmidt said this murder does not appear to be connected to the slaying of another woman whose body was discovered earlier this week in Fernan Lake near Coeur d'Alene. —From the Spokane Chronicle; Thursday afternoon, June 21, 1984∼Woman's mutilated body found in riverThe nude body of a woman was found Wednesday afternoon in the Spokane River below the Spokane Falls Community College campus, and police said the death is being investigated as a homicide.The body, which had not been identified by late Wednesday night, was spotted about 3:30 p.m. by two fishermen. A Fire Department boat crew recovered the body about 20 feet from shore.Police Lt. Gerald Hickman said the body had been mutilated, but would not be more specific. He said the body had been in the river a couple of days.A specific description of the woman was not disclosed by police, except that she was white. Hickman said her description did not match that of any women reported missing.—From The Spokesman-Review; Thursday morning, June 21, 1984\nRead More\nFamily Members\nParents\nWilliam Harvey Waymire\n1918–1991\nHelen Marie Holzheimer Waymire\n1938–1982\nSpouse\nDavid Lee William Vaughan\nFlowers\nLeave a Flower\nFairmount Memorial Park\nSpokane\nSpokane County\nWashington\nUSA\nFind a Grave\nFlower Delivery\nMemorials\nRegion\nNorth America\nUSA\nWashington\nSpokane County\nSpokane\nFairmount Memorial Park\nRuth Belle Waymire\nCreated by: Brad Preston\nAdded:29 Mar 2023\nDisplay alternate name\nCancel\nAdd Flower and Note\nMemorial Photos\nView Flower\nSave To\nThis memorial has been copied to your clipboard.\nFailed to copy\nAncestry\nVirtual Cemetery\nCopy to clipboard\nPrint\nYour Virtual Cemeteries\nLoading…\nCreate a Virtual Cemetery\nType new virtual cemetery name\nManage Virtual Cemeteries\nSave\nReport Abuse\nCancel\nReport Abuse\nDone\nDelete Flower\nCancel\nDelete Flower\nDelete Memorial\nCancel\nDelete\nReported Problems\nDelete\nReport a problem\nCemetery office has no record of this person\nCemetery office confirmed that this burial is unmarked\nI searched the entire cemetery and could not find the grave\nI searched the stated plot or section and could not find the grave\nThis burial is on private property or is otherwise inaccessible\nOther problem\nPlease select a problem\nReport Problem\nRecently Deceased\nCancel\nAccept Management\nReport a Duplicate Memorial\nWhich memorial do you think is a duplicate of Ruth Waymire (251426640)?\nWe will review the memorials and decide if they should be merged.
