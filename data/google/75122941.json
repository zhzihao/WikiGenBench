Divinagracia and Compliance and Monitoring Evaluation Office (CMEO) Director Grace L. Fernandez, the inspection team examined the application and renewal process of these LGUs. In particular, the team assessed their compliance with requirements on Citizen’s Charter, electronic Business One-Stop Shop (eBOSS) functionalities, and physical BOSS features to ensure a more efficient service delivery.\nRepublic Act No. 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business Law mandates LGUs to set up their most current Citizen’s Charters and establish their respective eBOSS. To help them achieve full compliance with this law, the ARTA team also presented their findings to the LGUs, zooming in on the required actions and recommendations.\n#ARTA #eBOSS\n+2\n8\nLike\nComment\nShare\n471 followers\n1w\nReport this post\n#HiringAngARTA\n1\nLike\nComment\nShare\nJoin now to see what you are missing\nBrowse recommended jobs for you\nView all updates, news, and articles\nJoin now\nSimilar pages\nOffice of the President of the Republic of the Philippines\nManila, San Miguel\nCommission on Elections - Philippines\nGovernment Administration\nManila, National Capital Region\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\nBanking\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs\nGovernment Administration\nPasay City, NCR\nPresidential Communications Operations Office\nGovernment Administration\nManila, Manila\nPhilippine Statistics Authority\nGovernment Administration\nQuezon City, Metro Manila\nPhilippine National Police\nArmed Forces\nQuezon City, National Capital Region\nPhilippine Competition Commission\nLaw Enforcement\nQuezon City, Metro Manila\nInternal Affairs Service-PNP\nLaw Enforcement\nQuezon City, Metro Manila\nPhilippine Guarantee Corporation\nFinancial Services\nMakati City, National Capital Region\nShow more similar pages\nShow fewer similar pages\nBrowse jobs\nProject Manager jobs\n24,579 open jobs\nResearch Assistant jobs\n4,938 open jobs\nSocial Media Manager jobs\n5,786 open jobs\nRecruiter jobs\n21,947 open jobs\nAnalyst jobs\n69,355 open jobs\nFull Stack Engineer jobs\n6,879 open jobs\nUser Experience Designer jobs\n3,750 open jobs\nSoftware Engineer jobs\n129,058 open jobs\nDeveloper jobs\n103,246 open jobs\nDistribution Manager jobs\n3,930 open jobs\nHead of Operations jobs\n2,348 open jobs\nDirector of Operations jobs\n920 open jobs\nHead of Sales jobs\n6,012 open jobs\nSales Director jobs\n7,202 open jobs\nDirector jobs\n105,240 open jobs\nHealth Coach jobs\n145 open jobs\nBusiness Development Specialist jobs\n15,621 open jobs\nBanker jobs\n2,464 open jobs\nLawyer jobs\n537 open jobs\nEngineer jobs\n91,595 open jobs\nShow more jobs like this\nShow fewer jobs like this\nMore searches\nMore searches\nLawyer jobs\nLinkedIn\n© 2024\nAbout\nAccessibility\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy Policy\nYour California Privacy Choices\nCookie Policy\nCopyright Policy\nBrand Policy\nGuest Controls\nCommunity Guidelines\nLanguage\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\nSign in\nWelcome back\nEmail or phone\nPassword\nShow\nSign in\nor\nNew to LinkedIn?
