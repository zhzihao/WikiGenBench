The NFR is an effort led by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to study the risk of developing cancer among firefighters. The information collected through the NFR will allow researchers to better understand the connection between firefighter exposure to dangerous toxins and cancer development.\nThe NFR is for all firefighters – career or volunteer, active or retired, with or without cancer, rookies or firefighters with experience. It takes about 30 minutes to register, and the information collected is confidential. The NFR is an opportunity for firefighters to help protect brother and sister firefighters from developing cancer—and it paves the way for new health and safety measures.\nThe NFFF and its affiliate organization, the First Responder Center for Excellence, are proud to join NIOSH and other partner organizations in encouraging all firefighters to enroll in the NFR. We recognize the significant value the NFR will contribute to protecting the lives of those who protect us.\nJoin the NFR today at NFR.cdc.gov\nRelated\nLearn more at www.cdc.gov/NFR\nHelp spread the word about the NFR\nNFFF Board Member Chief Billy Goldfeder's message about NFR\nVisit the FRCE Cancer Resource Hub\nUSFA Summit on Fire Prevention and Control Comprehensive Firefighter Cancer Strategy\nFire Service Cancer Vulnerability Assessment Program\nHonoring Our Fallen Heroes Act\nSimilar Posts You Might Also Like\nFoundation News\nUnited States Fire Administrator, FEMA Region V Administrator, and Nation’s Fire Service Leaders to travel to Detroit, Chicago, and Columbus to urge public to be Fire Safe and #WinterReady ahead of DHS Extreme Cold Summit\nFire Service Programs News\nFireRescue1 launches What Firefighters Want 2024 survey\nFirefighter News\nToledo Comes Together To Show Annual Support For Fallen Heroes\nThe National Fallen Firefighters Foundation relies on your donation to honor the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their communities and neighbors.\nGive Today\n<div class=\"elementor-column elementor-col-50 elementor-top-column elementor-element elementor-element-8a38ab9\" data-id=\"8a38ab9\" d"

Unfortunately, burgeoning data shows that these critical first responder communities across the country might also be facing threats to their health over the long term due to their heroic occupation. While much more information is still needed about the link between cancer and firefighting, it has been compelling enough for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to create a National Firefighter Registry for Cancer. This registry is the nation’s largest effort that works to explore cancer occurrences in the firefighter community nationwide.\nWhether you’re a current firefighter, a retired firefighter, or a public health communicator, being aware of the ongoing research evaluating cancer incidence in firefighters is crucial. Here’s what you need to know about why this research push is needed, the various exposures that firefighters face, the potential long-term impacts on their health, and what’s on the horizon for the newly-created cancer registry.\nWhy Has the NIOSH Created a New Cancer Registry?\nIn a press release in mid-April 2023, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the launch of its new National Firefighter Registry for Cancer, encouraging all U.S. Firefighters to join. According to the CDC, the registry's goals are to understand and reduce cancer in the fire service.\nThis registry is a part of the Biden Administration’s Cancer Moonshot mission. The particular focus on the connection between firefighting and cancer is guided by the fact that firefighters have unique on-the-job exposures to smoke and hazardous chemicals that increase their risk of developing cancer.\nAccording to the NIOSH, previous work on cancer exposure in firefighters has not included enough volunteer firefighters, female firefighters, or non-white firefighters. Therefore, more participants are needed to produce more comprehensive research.\nThe cancer registry is open to all professional and volunteer firefighters, so it will hopefully expand knowledge about cancer and firefighting by widening the research pool.\nWhat Unique Exposures Do Firefighters Face On the Job?\nAccording to the NIOSH, there are a number of factors that contribute to the exposure a firefighter faces on the job. The exposures vary depending on what type of structure is burning—for example, a physical structure such as a house releases different chemicals and contaminants than a burning vehicle. The level of risk depends on the particular material that is burning, as well as the conditions of the fire (is it enclosed or in an open outside area?) and the amount of oxygen available.\nMuch attention has been paid to the particular exposure of skin to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), despite protective gear and decontamination processes. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), other toxic exposures that are connected to firefighting include known carcinogens (cancer-causing substances) like perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and diesel fumes, as well as arsenic, asbestos, benzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, silica, sulfuric acid, and many others.\nWhat Does Research Say About the Long-Term Impacts of Firefighting On Health?\nAccording to the nonprofit Firefighter Cancer Support Network (FCSN), cancer is the leading threat to firefighter health today. Compared to the general population, a firefighter has a 9 percent higher risk of getting diagnosed with cancer and a 14 percent higher risk of dying from cancer. Some cancers are more likely to impact firefighters compared to the general population, including bladder cancer, leukemia, mesothelioma (2 times greater risk), testicular cancer (2.02 times greater risk), and esophageal cancer (62 percent higher risk of getting a diagnosis).\nFurthermore, a substantial amount of research has been conducted about the impact of firefighting on other long-term health conditions as well, such as cardiovascular disease.\nWhat’s on the Horizon for the National Fire Registry?\nThe NIOSH is encouraging a wide swath of U.S. firefighters to join the National Fire Registry in order to help prevent future cancer cases and to improve current knowledge about cancer risk in underrepresented groups. Growing the base of firefighters involved in research will enrich studies moving forward and help make this critical occupation safer for all.\nTo learn more about the NFR or to join the registry, visit NFR.cdc.gov.\nResearch and materials for this article were compiled, written, and distributed on behalf of the National Public Health Information Coalition.
