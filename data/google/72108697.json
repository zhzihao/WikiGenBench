Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine has contributed to a surge in energy prices, driving high inflation across the world. Central banks are raising interest rates to get inflation under control, which has pushed up the cost of borrowing for families, businesses and governments. Growth is slowing and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects a third of the global economy to fall into recession this year or next.\nThis comes against a backdrop of higher levels of government debt due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and current energy crisis. Debt interest spending is now expected to reach a record £120.4 billion this year. These factors have contributed to a significant gap opening between the funds the government receives in revenue and its spending.\nThe government’s priorities are stability, growth and public services. Economic stability relies on fiscal sustainability – and the Autumn Statement sets out the government’s plan to ensure that national debt falls as a proportion of the economy over the medium term. This will reduce debt servicing costs and leave more money to invest in public services; support the Bank of England’s action to control inflation; and give businesses the stability and confidence they need to invest and grow in the UK.\nTo achieve this aim, the government has reversed nearly all the measures in the Growth Plan 2022. The Autumn Statement sets out further steps on taxation and spending, ensuring that each contributes in a broadly balanced way to repairing the public finances, while protecting the most vulnerable. The government’s approach to delivering fiscal sustainability is underpinned by fairness, with those on the highest incomes and making the highest profits paying a larger share.\nThe Autumn Statement reduces the income tax additional rate threshold from £150,000 to £125,140, increasing taxes for those on high incomes. Income tax, National Insurance and Inheritance Tax thresholds will be maintained at their current levels for a further two years, to April 2028. The government will also reduce the Dividend Allowance and Capital Gains Tax Annual Exempt Amount.\nBusinesses must also pay their fair share. The Autumn Statement fixes the National Insurance Secondary Threshold at £9,100 until April 2028. The government will implement the OECD Pillar 2 rules, to deliver a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. R&D tax credits will be reformed to ensure public money is spent effectively and best supports innovation.\nThe Autumn Statement sets out reforms to ensure businesses in the energy sector who are making extraordinary profits contribute more. The Energy Profits Levy will be increased by 10 percentage points to 35% and extended to the end of March 2028, and a new, temporary 45% Electricity Generator Levy will be applied on the extraordinary returns being made by electricity generators.\nWhile taking these necessary steps, the government also recognises that businesses are facing significant inflationary pressures. The Autumn Statement sets out a package of targeted support to help with business rates costs worth £13.6 billion over the next 5 years. The business rates multipliers will be frozen in 2023-24, and upward transitional relief caps will provide support to ratepayers facing large bill increases following the revaluation. The relief for retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be extended and increased, and there will be additional support provided for small businesses.\nThe government is taking a balanced approach between revenue raising and spending restraint, whilst protecting vital public services. The Autumn Statement confirms that total departmental spending will grow in real terms at 3.7% a year on average over the current Spending Review period. Within this, departments will identify savings to manage pressures from higher inflation, supported by an Efficiency and Savings Review.\nTo help get debt falling, for the years beyond the current Spending Review period, planned departmental resource spending will continue to grow, but slower than the economy, at 1% a year in real terms until 2027-28. Total departmental capital spending in 2024-25 will be maintained in cash terms until 2027-28, delivering £600 billion of investment over the next 5 years. This includes maintaining the government’s commitments to deliver major infrastructure projects.\nWhile delivering overall spending restraint, the government is prioritising further investment in the NHS and social care, and in schools. Supporting these two public services is the government’s priority for public spending.\nThe Autumn Statement makes up to £8 billion of funding available for the NHS and adult social care in England in 2024-25. This includes £3.3 billion to respond to the significant pressures facing the NHS, enabling rapid action to improve emergency, elective and primary care performance, and introducing reforms to support the workforce and improve performance across the health system over the longer term.\nThe NHS’s performance is closely tied to that of the adult social care system, so the government will also make available up to £4.7 billion in 2024-25 to put the adult social care system in England on a stronger financial footing and improve the quality of and access to care for many of the most vulnerable in our society. This includes £1 billion to directly support discharges from hospital into the community, to support the NHS.\nThe Autumn Statement announces a real-terms increase in per pupil funding from that committed at Spending Review 2021. The core schools budget in England will receive £2.3 billion of additional funding in each of 2023-24 and 2024-25, enabling schools to continue to invest in high quality teaching and to target additional support to the children who need it most.\nThe government has taken unprecedented steps to help households deal with rising living costs and the energy crisis in 2022-23. The level of spending seen this year, if sustained over time, would add further upward pressures on inflation and interest rates and risk excessively burdening future generations with higher debt. The Autumn Statement sets out steps to taper the support next year and make it more targeted to those who most need it, while also raising more through levies on energy producers.\nThe Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) will be maintained through the winter, limiting typical energy bills to £2,500 per year. From April 2023 the EPG will rise to £3,000. With prices forecast to remain elevated throughout next year, this equates to an average of £500 support for households in 2023-24. On top of this, to protect the most vulnerable, in 2023-24 an additional Cost of Living Payment of £900 will be provided to households on means-tested benefits, of £300 to pensioner households, and of £150 to individuals on disability benefits. The government will also raise benefits, including working age benefits and the State Pension, in line with inflation from April 2023, ensuring they increase by over 10%.\nAlongside direct support, the government is setting a national ambition to reduce energy consumption by 15% by 2030, delivered through public and private investment, and a range of cost-free and low-cost steps to reduce energy demand.\nEconomic growth is the only way to sustainably fund public services, raise living standards and level up the country. The Autumn Statement sets out measures to boost growth and productivity by investing in people, infrastructure, and innovation. These include additional support to increase labour market participation; increasing public investment in infrastructure across this Parliament; delivering planned skills reforms; and supporting R&D by increasing public funding to £20 billion in 2024-25.\nThe government will ensure that those sectors which have the most potential for growth - such as digital, green technology and life sciences - will be supported through measures to reduce unnecessary regulation and boost innovation and growth. The Autumn Statement also announces the final Solvency II reforms, which will unlock tens of billions of pounds of investment across a range of sectors.\nBy taking difficult decisions on tax and spending, the Autumn Statement sets out a clear and credible path to get debt falling and deliver the economic stability needed to support long-term prosperity.\nSustainable public finances\nSustainable public finances provide the stability and confidence that underpin the economy, supporting businesses and households across the country. By taking the responsible decisions needed to achieve fiscal sustainability, the government is providing the necessary conditions for economic growth.\nThe UK economy has been hit by significant global shocks. Putin’s weaponisation of gas supplies to Europe pushed prices to record levels, contributing to high inflation and leading the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to forecast a recession that started in Q3 2022. This comes at a time when the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. During a period of significant global economic challenges, the UK economy continues to benefit from the underlying strength of its macroeconomic framework. As set out in Chapter 4, the government has affirmed the remit of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England, which is taking action to get inflation under control. The forecasts produced by the OBR support transparency, accountability and credibility.\nThe UK’s economic and fiscal outlook has deteriorated materially since March 2022. Higher inflation and interest rates, coupled with slower economic growth, have hit the public finances. Difficult decisions are necessary to put the public finances back on to a sustainable footing in the medium term. This is the case across both taxation and public spending, and the government is adopting a balanced approach. Given the scale of the challenge, it is inevitable that everyone will need to play a part in restoring the public finances. In taking these decisions at the Autumn Statement, the government has ensured that the greatest burden falls on those with the broadest shoulders, while supporting vital public services and protecting the most vulnerable in our society. As a result, the OBR forecasts that underlying debt (public sector net debt excluding the Bank of England) will be falling as a share of the economy in 2027-28.\nFiscal sustainability\nSustainable public finances are a pre-requisite for macroeconomic stability and growth. Unsustainable public finances would lead to higher borrowing costs and dampen economic growth over the long term. If the public finances are on an unsustainable trajectory, larger reductions in public spending or a higher tax burden may be required to repair them.\nA key measure of fiscal sustainability is the trajectory of public debt as a share of GDP. Before accounting for the effect of the measures taken at the Autumn Statement, underlying debt would have been rising by 1.0% of GDP in 2027-28. Ensuring that debt as a share of GDP falls over time allows the government to fund high quality public services while preserving its ability to support households and businesses in the face of economic shocks. Debts cannot continue to grow forever – at some point lenders become concerned that they will not be repaid and choose to lend their money elsewhere. That is why the government is reaffirming its commitment to ensuring debt falls over the medium term. Several other countries have also reaffirmed their commitment to return to fiscal discipline in the medium term, including reducing debt as a share of GDP.\nIn the face of regular, significant shocks and long-term pressures, keeping the debt trajectory under control requires debt to fall as a share of GDP in normal times. The OBR stated that, on average, the UK economy has been hit by a fiscal shock such as a recession every nine years, and a typical recession could add an average of 10 percentage points to the debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, long-term structural changes, such as an ageing population, pose challenges to the public finances that will materialise over the coming decades.\nReducing debt as a share of GDP will also help to reduce spending on debt interest, which could otherwise be spent on public services. Higher inflation and rising borrowing costs have increased the amount the government is spending servicing its debt. The OBR expects spending on debt interest to reach £120.4 billion this year, the highest since the late 1940s, both as a share of GDP and as a share of revenue. If debt interest spending were a government department, its departmental budget would be second only to the Department for Health and Social Care. As set out in Chart 1.1, this year the government is expected to spend more than 11% of its revenue on debt interest, the highest level since the 1960s. Compared to March, debt interest spending remains elevated over the medium term. The debt interest to revenue ratio reaches 7.6% in 2026-27, compared to 3.3% as forecast in March for the same year.\nThe UK’s public finances are exposed to changes in inflation and interest rates, as shown in Chart 1.2. The OBR estimates that the impact of a one percentage point rise in short rates would increase debt interest spending by £7.9 billion in 2026-27.\nThe cost of government borrowing has been rising over the course of 2022 in all major advanced economies. The relatively similar increases in 10-year sovereign bond yields over the year-to-date in G7 economies (except for Japan) is consistent with these moves reflecting largely common factors. There was significant repricing in UK government debt during late September. This volatility exposed vulnerabilities in a specific segment of the financial sector, leading to a risk of further dysfunction in the gilt market. In line with its statutory financial stability objective, the Bank of England acted to restore orderly market conditions through the temporary and targeted purchase of long-dated and index-linked UK government bonds. UK yields have fallen since the peaks in late September.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer welcomed this action in his annual remit and recommendations letter to the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and reaffirmed the importance of the FPC’s primary objective of promoting UK financial stability. The letter set out that, while it might not be reasonable to expect market participants to insure against all market outcomes, it is important that lessons are learned from the recent dysfunction in the gilt market and the vulnerabilities this exposed.\nChart 1.1: Debt interest to revenue ratio with illustrative interest rate and retail price index shocks\nNote: Debt interest to revenue ratio uses net debt interest, calculated as public sector interest paid less property income receivable, which is also deducted from revenue. The shocks are modelled using OBR’s debt interest ready reckoner. For illustrative rate and RPI shocks all increases are assumed to take effect at the beginning of 2022-23 and continue throughout the forecast.\nSource: Office for National Statistics, Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury calculations.\nPublic Sector (excluding the Public Sector Banks) interest & dividends paid to the private sector and the rest of the world.

Overall, this leaves policy providing targeted near-term support, before a medium-term consolidation to ensure sustainable public finances.\nTable 1.1: Total policy decisions 2022-23 to 2027-28\n£bn\n2022-23\n2023-24\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\nTotal policy since March 2022\n-64.2\n-39.8\n+0.6\n+14.9\n+26.5\n+39.4\nNew policy at Autumn Statement (excluding energy and cost of living support)\n+1.3\n-2.0\n+10.0\n+25.7\n+41.4\n+54.9\nNew policy at Autumn Statement (including energy and cost of living support)(1)\n-41.9\n-27.1\n+9.8\n+25.5\n+41.2\n+54.7\n1 Please refer to Table 5.1 for more detailed breakdowns\nNote: negative numbers represent net support to the economy\nSource: HM Treasury\nSource: Office for National Statistics (ONS code: CPOA) and Office for Budget Responsibility.\nChart 1.5: Public sector net borrowing\nSource: Office for National Statistics (ONS code: J5IJ) and Office for Budget Responsibility.\nThe rules are met with a buffer (“headroom”) of £9.2 billion against the debt rule and £18.6 billion against the borrowing rule in the target year. Headroom increases the resilience of fiscal plans, as it avoids the need to adjust policy if the forecast deteriorates, but the level needs to balance implications for public services, taxes and the economy. OBR analysis highlights that the headroom to underlying debt falling could be wiped out by a 0.4 percentage point increase in interest rates at all maturities, or equally would be doubled by a 0.4 percentage point fall.\nThe fiscal rules are published in an updated Charter for Budget Responsibility alongside the Autumn Statement.\nThe Charter retains the commitment to consider wider data on the strength of the public sector balance sheet, including broader fiscal indicators such as public sector net worth. To ensure effective management of public sector assets and liabilities, an integral part of fiscal sustainability, the government will undertake periodic reporting on how it is managing them. This will set out the government’s objectives across the balance sheet, and how departments are delivering efficiencies through better management of their assets and liabilities. This builds on the Balance Sheet Review report published in 2020. The government will look to publish the first report by the end of 2024.\nTaking Responsible Decisions\nDelivering sustainable public finances requires difficult but unavoidable decisions on tax and public spending. The Autumn Statement sets out a fiscally responsible path to getting debt falling as share of the economy, protecting vital public services and prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable.\nTaxation\nThe government has taken steps to help households with the rising cost of living through the tax system in the short term. In July, the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance contributions (NICs) was raised from £9,880 to £12,570, and in November the Health and Social Care Levy was reversed, saving almost 30 million workers an average of £480 in total in 2023-24.\nIn light of the deterioration in the economic outlook since the Spring, the government must now take further action to return the public finances to a sustainable path.\nHaving concluded that now is not the right time to proceed with a package of tax cuts, the government has already confirmed the reversal of the majority of the tax measures set out in the Growth Plan. Taken together with maintaining the basic rate of income tax at 20% these changes are estimated to raise £34 billion per year.\nAs previously confirmed, the planned increase in the Corporation Tax rate to 25% for companies with over £250,000 in profits will go ahead. This will still be the lowest rate in the G7 ensuring the UK remains strongly competitive internationally. The Corporation Tax rise in April 2023 will only affect the most profitable companies because of the Small Profits Rate. The additional rate of income tax will now not be removed, and the basic rate of income tax will be maintained at 20%.\nGoing forward, the fairest way to restore the public finances is to ask everyone to contribute a little, with those on the highest incomes and those making the highest profits paying a larger share.\nThe Autumn Statement takes steps towards this. The government will decrease the additional rate threshold from £150,000 to £125,140 from 6 April 2023. The government is also fixing other personal tax thresholds within income tax, NICs and Inheritance Tax for an additional 2 years, until April 2028. Those in the highest income households will contribute more.\nA fair tax system also ensures that individuals doing similar work pay a similar amount of tax, and that those with unearned income also contribute. The Autumn Statement reduces the generosity of the Dividend Allowance and the Capital Gains Tax Annual Exempt Amount. The Personal Allowance will generally be available in addition to the reduced Dividend Allowance and Capital Gains Tax Annual Exempt Amount.\nThe tax system should continue to adapt to reflect consumer behaviour. Reflecting the success of the transition to electric vehicles, the government will therefore introduce Vehicle Excise Duty on electric cars, vans and motorcycles from April 2025. This will ensure that all motorists begin to pay a fairer tax contribution.\nThe Autumn Statement ensures that businesses making extraordinary profits due to external factors contribute more. This includes those in the oil and gas sector. The government is therefore extending the Energy Profits Levy to the end of March 2028, and increasing its rate by 10 percentage points to 35% from 1 January 2023.\nThe government will consult stakeholders over the coming months as part of a review of the UK’s long-term tax treatment of the North Sea after the Energy Profits Levy ceases, to ensure the regime delivers predictability and certainty, supporting investment, jobs and the country’s energy security.\nThe structure of our energy market means high oil and gas prices are driving up the cost of otherwise cheap low-carbon electricity in the UK. The government will introduce a new, temporary 45% Electricity Generator Levy on these extraordinary returns from 1 January 2023. This will help fund government support for energy bills and vital public services.\nIt is fair that all businesses contribute to restoring the public finances. The Autumn Statement maintains the NICs Secondary Threshold for employers at £9,100 until April 2028 and the VAT registration threshold at £85,000 for two years from April 2024.\nAs part of the ongoing review of the R&D reliefs, the government is reforming the reliefs to ensure taxpayers’ money is spent as effectively as possible by rebalancing rates. These changes will help to support fiscal sustainability by raising revenue and reducing fraud and error, without materially changing the levels of R&D expenditure over the forecast period. The government remains committed to supporting R&D, and the amount of support provided to innovative businesses through R&D tax reliefs is forecast to increase.\nWhilst businesses have their part to play in returning the public finances to a sustainable path, the government is committed to supporting small businesses and the high street. 70% of actively trading companies will not see an increase in the rate of Corporation Tax they pay due to the Small Profits Rate, and 40% of employers will not be affected by decisions on the threshold for employer NICs due to the Employment Allowance. It is fair that the largest employers pay the most.\nThe government is going further to support businesses and the high street by reducing the burden of business rates, providing £13.6 billion of support for businesses over the next 5 years. This includes freezing the multipliers, increasing relief for retail, hospitality and leisure to 75%, and reforming transitional relief on the revaluation by exchequer funding the scheme and abolishing downward caps. This builds on the government’s existing commitment to reform the business rates system by delivering more frequent revaluations, which will ensure rates better reflect current market values.\nTo support businesses to invest and grow, the government is setting the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) at its highest ever permanent level of £1 million from 1 April 2023. This amounts to full expensing for an estimated 99% of UK businesses, which means that those businesses can write off the cost of qualifying plant machinery investment in one go. A permanent increase provides businesses with stability and makes tax simpler for any business investing between £200,000 and £1 million.\nThe government’s action to repair the public finances will be supported by a package of measures to tackle tax avoidance, evasion, and wider non-compliance. This will raise an estimated £1.7 billion over the next 5 years.\nThe government will also implement the OECD Pillar 2 rules for a global minimum corporate tax rate, for accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. This will protect the UK tax base against aggressive tax planning and reinforce the competitiveness of the UK, raising £2.3 billion a year by 2027-28.\nPublic spending\nWhile increasing tax revenues, the government is taking a responsible and disciplined approach to public spending which prioritises vital public services and infrastructure to drive economic growth.\nSpending Review 2021 set UK government departments’ resource and capital Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) budgets and the devolved administrations’ block grants from 2022-23 to 2024-25. The Autumn Statement confirms that departmental DEL budgets will be maintained at least in line with the budgets set at the Spending Review.\nAt Spending Review 2021, departments were also provided with funding to cover employer costs of the Health and Social Care Levy. As the Levy is no longer being introduced as a separate tax from April 2023 and departments will not face these additional costs, their budgets have been adjusted to remove this compensation.\nTo keep spending focused on the government’s priorities and help manage pressures from higher inflation, government departments will continue to identify efficiency savings in day-to-day budgets. To support departments to do this, the government is launching an Efficiency and Savings Review. This will include reprioritising spending away from lower-value and low-priority programmes, and reviewing the effectiveness of public bodies.\nThe Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for the Cabinet Office will work with all the cross-cutting government functions and departments to drive up professional standards, accelerate progress on innovation and automation, and further reduce waste and duplication. The government will report on progress with the Review in the spring.\nTo ensure key public services continue to deliver, the government is prioritising further funding to support the healthcare system and schools. As a result of this targeted additional funding, total departmental spending (total DEL) will grow in real terms at 3.7% a year on average over this Spending Review period.\nProtecting existing capital plans means public sector net investment as a proportion of GDP will average 2.5% over the forecast period, delivering over £600 billion of planned public sector gross investment over the next 5 years.\nTable 2.1: Resource DEL (RDEL) excluding depreciation\n£ billion (current prices)\nOutturn(1)\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\n2021-22\n2022-23\n2023-24\n2024-25\nResource DEL excluding depreciation\nHealth and Social Care\n144.1\n168.2\n176.2\n180.4\nof which: NHS England\n133.7\n152.6\n160.4\n165.9\nEducation\n70.1\n77.1\n81.2\n82.6\nof which: core schools\n49.8\n53.8\n57.3\n58.8\nHome Office\n14.4\n14.6\n15.4\n15.5\nJustice\n8.5\n9.4\n9.8\n10.0\nLaw Officers' Departments\n0.7\n0.8\n0.8\n0.8\nDefence\n31.7\n32.1\n31.9\n32.0\nSingle Intelligence Account\n2.5\n2.6\n2.3\n2.4\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office\n7.5\n8.2\n7.8\n7.7\nDLUHC Local Government\n10.7\n11.8\n15.7\n15.3\nDLUHC Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\n2.6\n3.1\n2.1\n2.1\nTransport\n3.2\n8.3\n6.8\n5.7\nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy(2)\n2.4\n2.6\n2.7\n2.6\nDigital, Culture, Media and Sport\n1.6\n2.0\n1.6\n1.6\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs\n4.1\n4.5\n4.3\n4.2\nInternational Trade\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5\n0.5\nWork and Pensions\n5.7\n8.4\n8.0\n7.1\nHM Revenue and Customs\n4.6\n5.9\n5.6\n4.6\nHM Treasury\n0.4\n0.4\n0.3\n0.3\nCabinet Office\n0.9\n0.7\n0.5\n0.4\nScotland(3)\n32.5\n35.3\n36.5\n36.9\nWales(4)\n13.7\n15.2\n15.9\n15.6\nNorthern Ireland\n12.5\n13.4\n13.5\n13.6\nSmall and Independent Bodies\n2.4\n2.4\n2.4\n2.4\nUK Shared Prosperity Fund\n-\n-\n0.6\n1.3\nReserves\n-\n10.7\n13.9\n12.9\nTotal Resource DEL excluding depreciation, ringfenced COVID-19 and energy support funding in DEL\n377.2\n438.3\n456.2\n458.6\nRingfenced COVID-19 funding\n74.6\n-\n-\n-\nEnergy support funding in DEL(2)\n-\n13.9\n-\n-\nTotal Resource DEL excluding depreciation\n451.8\n452.2\n456.2\n458.6\nAllowance for Shortfall\n-\n-2.4\n-3.7\n-3.6\nTotal Resource DEL excluding depreciation, post allowance for shortfall\n451.8\n449.8\n452.6\n455.0\n£ billion (current prices)\nOutturn\nPlans\nPlans\nPlans\n2021-22(1)\n2022-23\n2023-24\n2024-25\nCapital DEL\nHealth and Social Care\n9.0\n12.0\n11.7\n12.6\nEducation\n4.7\n6.3\n7.0\n6.1\nHome Office\n0.9\n1.2\n1.0\n1.1\nJustice\n1.4\n1.7\n2.3\n1.5\nLaw Officers' Departments\n0.0\n0.1\n0.0\n0.0\nDefence\n14.2\n19.5\n16.5\n16.6\nSingle Intelligence Account\n0.9\n1.2\n1.2\n1.2\nForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office\n1.7\n2.6\n3.6\n4.1\nDLUHC Levelling Up, Housing and Communities\n6.2\n9.5\n6.9\n6.8\nLevelling Up Fund\n-\n0.9\n1.4\n1.4\nTransport\n19.0\n19.9\n19.9\n20.5\nBusiness, Energy and Industrial Strategy(2)\n20.7\n17.8\n20.8\n21.2\nDigital, Culture, Media and Sport\n0.5\n0.8\n1.1\n1.2\nEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs\n1.4\n2.1\n3.0\n2.9\nInternational Trade\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nWork and Pensions\n0.3\n0.8\n0.6\n0.5\nHM Revenue and Customs\n0.7\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\nHM Treasury\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\nCabinet Office\n0.3\n1.1\n1.2\n2.7\nScotland\n5.1\n7.2\n5.9\n5.6\nWales\n3.0\n3.3\n3.0\n2.9\nNorthern Ireland\n1.8\n2.1\n2.0\n1.8\nSmall and Independent Bodies\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.7\nUK Shared Prosperity Fund\n-\n-\n0.1\n0.2\nReserves\n-\n4.1\n3.3\n3.2\nAdjustment for Budget Exchange\n-\n-2.4\n-\n-\nTotal Capital DEL excluding ringfenced COVID-19 funding and energy support funding in DEL\n92.1\n112.8\n113.6\n115.2\nMemo: Total Capital DEL excluding ringfenced COVID-19, energy support, and intragovernmental leases(3)\n93.0\n106.9\n111.5\n111.9\nRingfenced COVID-19 funding\n0.9\n-\n-\n-\nEnergy support funding in DEL(2)\n-\n5.5\n-\n-\nTotal Capital DEL\n93.0\n118.3\n113.6\n115.2\nRemove Capital DEL not in PSGI(4)\n-16.0\n-19.5\n-10.3\n-12.3\nAllowance for Shortfall\n-\n-9.9\n-8.8\n-8.2\nPublic Sector Gross Investment in Capital DEL\n77.0\n88.8\n94.4\n94.7\n1 2021-22 figures reflect outturn in PESA, adjusted for provisional estimates of core spending.

This is underpinned by the fiscal rules outlined in Chapter 1.\nThe government is expected to borrow £177.0 billion this year, which is £77.9 billion higher than the OBR forecast in March. This mainly reflects historically high spending on servicing government debt and energy support, with debt interest spending peaking at £120.4 billion this year – the highest since the late 1940s both as a share of GDP and as a share of revenue. As the OBR highlights, these “increases in debt interest spending relative to March are not just large but also take hold quickly, reflecting a significant increase in the sensitivity of the debt stock to changes in interest rates and inflation since the start of the century.”\nBorrowing is expected to fall by the end of the forecast. The OBR forecasts that, by 2027-28, PSNB will be reduced to £69.2 billion, from a peak of £177.0 billion in 2022-23. This reflects government policy decisions to strengthen the public finances and the recovery in the economy. The current budget deficit is also gradually reduced, reaching £5.6 billion or 0.2% of GDP by the end of the forecast.\nAs set out in Table 4.2, while borrowing is expected to fall by 2027-28, it remains higher in every year than the OBR’s March forecast. This is due in large part to higher debt interest spending and a weaker economy forecast.\nTable 4.2: Changes in borrowing since March 2022\n£ billion\nOutturn\nForecast\n2021-22\n2022-23\n2023-24\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\nMarch 2022 forecast\n127.8\n99.1\n50.2\n36.5\n34.8\n31.6\nNovember 2022 forecast\n133.3\n177.0\n140.0\n84.3\n76.9\n80.3\n69.2\nDifference\n5.4\n77.9\n89.8\n47.8\n42.1\n48.8\nUnderlying differences(1)\n35.1\n59.4\n45.2\n55.8\n74.8\nDebt interest spending\n41.1\n52.1\n26.6\n27.0\n46.6\nReceipts\n0.5\n1.0\n6.7\n17.4\n24.6\nWelfare spending\n2.2\n10.3\n19.7\n18.1\n14.0\nOther spending\n-8.7\n-3.9\n-7.9\n-6.7\n-10.4\nDirect effect of policy decisions\n64.2\n39.8\n-0.6\n-14.9\n-26.5\n-39.4\nEnergy and cost-of-living support(2)\n58.4\n25.0\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\nOther spending measures\n6.0\n9.3\n4.2\n-9.7\n-19.9\n-31.1\nTax measures\n-0.2\n5.5\n-5.0\n-5.4\n-6.8\n-8.5\nIndirect effects of decisions\n-21.4\n-9.3\n3.3\n1.2\n0.5\n0.6\n2 Includes energy price guarantee cap, energy bill relief scheme, and cost-of-living support measures announced on May 27\nOutturn\nForecast\n2021-22\n2022-23\n2023-24\n2024-25\n2025-26\n2026-27\n2027-28\nPublic sector net debt(1)\n97.4\n101.9\n106.7\n105.8\n101.7\n100.0\n99.3\nPublic sector net debt ex Bank of England(1)\n84.3\n89.9\n95.9\n97.2\n97.6\n97.6\n97.3\nPublic sector net financial liabilities(1)\n84.9\n89.0\n92.1\n91.4\n90.8\n89.8\n88.4\nPublic sector net worth(1),(2),(3)\n88.6\n93.4\n97.2\n96.8\n94.8\n92.2\n89.4\nGeneral government gross debt\n101.9\n103.1\n109.6\n110.9\n111.3\n111.3\n110.7\nPublic sector net borrowing\n5.7\n7.1\n5.5\n3.2\n2.8\n2.9\n2.4\nPublic sector net investment\n2.4\n2.5\n3.0\n2.7\n2.5\n2.3\n2.2\nCurrent budget deficit\n3.3\n4.6\n2.5\n0.5\n0.3\n0.5\n0.2\nCyclically-adjusted public sector net borrowing\n6.5\n7.5\n4.1\n1.5\n1.8\n2.4\n2.3\nCyclically-adjusted current budget deficit\n4.2\n5.0\n1.1\n-1.2\n-0.8\n0.1\n0.1\nGeneral government net borrowing\n6.4\n7.1\n6.4\n3.7\n3.0\n3.3\nSource: Office for Budget Responsibility, Office for National Statistics and HM Treasury calculations\nPublic Sector Net Debt ex BoE – ONS code CPOA, Current Budget Deficit – ONS code JW2V, Public sector net investment – ONS code MUB2, Public sector net borrowing– ONS code J5IJ, General Government Gross Debt – ONS code BKPX, General Government Net Borrowing - ONS code NNBK\nThese changes will allow the government to better distribute and price risk when using the balance sheet to deliver its policy objectives.

Having undone the substance of Kwasi Kwarteng’s catastrophic mini Budget in October, Jeremy Hunt could not have taken a more different tone to that of his predecessor yesterday. Yet while he may be more fiscally conservative than Mr Kwarteng, his promises were less fiscally conservative than those of any of his other predecessors since 2010. He set himself the loosest of fiscal rules, and is meeting them by a hair’s breadth. Gone is any ambition to get to current budget balance – to borrow only to invest; and getting debt on a downward trajectory relative to national income is aimed at only in five years’ time.In the period up to 2026-27 Mr Hunt has accepted a large part of the additional borrowing forecast since March, rather than offset this through higher taxes or lower spending. Borrowing will take the strain in the near-term. The great majority of the planned consolidation is due only after the next election. There are promises of spending increases over the next two years, not spending cuts. And other than the windfall taxes on energy companies, most of the planned tax rises ramp up over time.Given the precarious state of the economy, the uncertainty surrounding forecasts, and the fact that high inflation makes keeping within current spending totals challenging enough, this may well be the right balance. Rather than implement a painful package of spending cuts that could, in hindsight, turn out to have been unnecessary, he is hoping that good news comes along and that those spending cuts aren’t needed after all. Remember though, uncertainty runs in both directions. Things could turn out worse that predicted. If so the pain to come will be even greater.In sum, this is a chancellor erring on the side of caution in terms of protecting spending and the economy in the short run, rather than erring on the side of prioritising shoring up the public finances.Mr Hunt might think himself lucky that it is the OBR and not the Bank of England whose forecasts he needs to use. The difference between the two is remarkable. The Bank ismuchgloomier than the OBR – though relative to most other forecasters, it is the Bank which looks to be the outlier. If the Bank turns out to be right, things will be tougher still. It is a quirk of the current system that monetary policy and fiscal policy are made off the back of quite different forecasts.Borrowing is going to be relatively high into the foreseeable future. Tax is going to be very high indeed. It will settle at its highest sustained level in history relative to national income, and at least four percentage points of GDP, around £100 billion a year, higher than where it has been for most of the last 70 years.Spending too will be high. Yet spending is also to be extremely tightly controlled. At least in principle. After the next election. If those post-election plans are delivered, it will feel pretty austere.That is a grim place to be – high borrowing, high debt, high tax, and yet a lot of public services feeling under strain. How can all that be the case? Surely with lots of tax and lots of borrowing it should be boom time for public spending.Part of the answer of course lies in the fact that we just got a whole lot poorer. That is the central fact that underlies most of what we heard.Part of the answer lies in the extraordinary scale of expected spending on debt interest. It looks like doubling relative to forecasts and hitting £100 billion a year by the end of the forecast period. That’s more than spending on any public service bar the NHS. As interest rates rise, the consequences of some of the borrowing that has happened over the last decade, and in particular of QE, as well as of more borrowing over the next few years, are coming home to roost. Borrowing is not for free.That increase in debt interest, plus higher spending on health and on benefits, entirely explains the growth in the size of the state over the period from 2019 to the later years of this decade. With defence spending cuts off the table, an ageing population, and pressures everywhere else you look, my guess is that we are in a new era of higher taxation, higher spending (as a fraction of national income) and a bigger state.I would be most surprised if the tax burden gets back down to its long term pre Covid average at any time in the coming decades. Higher taxes look to be here to stay.Public spendingLook at the official figures and the public spending numbers don’t look too bad over the next couple of years. Despite higher inflation, real public service spending looks like it is due to grow only marginally less quickly than was planned last September.In part that’s because more money has been found for health, schools and local government. In part, though, the figures are flattered by underspends in the base year, making increases look bigger, and also by some of the quirks of the GDP deflator. It remains the case that government will not be able to fund pay rises that anywhere near match inflation from within planned spending totals unless there is a big loss of jobs. Public pay setting will remain one of the biggest challenges.Beyond the next two years all the spending numbers should be taken with a large pinch of salt. If kept to they will mean cuts, if modest ones, to most public services. It is unlikely these spending plans will actually be kept to. Indeed, I would be willing to wager a considerable sum that spending will turn out higher than planned – as it literally always does.Two particular points.First, it is awful that the social care reforms will not now be implemented next year as planned. I rather fear that another two-year delay amounts to a death knell for these vital changes. Government should not be making and then reneging on promises like this which matter so much to vulnerable people.Second, what on earth is happening to incapacity and disability benefits? Since March the OBR has revised upwards its estimates of spending on these benefits by staggering £7.5 billion a year, and estimates of the number of recipients by more than a million. At the same time, we have a delay until 2028 in moving existing claimants of out of work health related benefits onto Universal Credit. This looks horribly like an effort to push a relatively small increase in spending to beyond the forecast horizon, and in doing so delaying the full roll out of the new system. This is very odd, and very concerning.Living standardsThe most striking figures in the OBR report are those pertaining to living standards, as measured by Real Household Disposable Income per person. Down 7% over this year and next, much the biggest fall in living memory and off the back of very poor income growth for many years. This will hit everyone. But perhaps it will be those on middling sorts of incomes who feel the biggest hit. They won’t benefit from the targeted support to those on means-tested benefits. Their wages are falling and their taxes are rising. Middle England is set for a shock.All this follows a painful decade and more. Median real wages are set to remain at much the same level as they were at the start of the 2010s. Earnings and incomes have barely risen. On some measures it looks like we will be an astonishing 30% worse off than we might have expected had pre-financial crisis trends continued through to the mid-2020s.Significant support to benefit recipients, on top of capping average energy bills at £3,000, will provide a better and more targeted approach to high energy prices than proposed by Liz Truss. Put all the tax and welfare changes together and this was a progressive fiscal statement – tax rises for the rich and increased targeting on the poor. It’s just that virtually all of us can expect to be worse off.TaxIt remains the case that the big tax changes coming in over the next few years are those that had already been announced. Corporation tax revenues are likely to hit record levels as the rate rises to 25%. The freezes to income tax allowances and thresholds constitute a very big tax increase indeed.The measures announced yesterday were relatively modest by comparison. In the longer term the biggest is the freezing of the point at which employers start to pay NICs – though more immediately the energy profits levy is due to raise more. Reducing the point at which the additional 45% rate of income tax kicks in raises less than £1 billion a year, as does the reduction in the dividend allowance. The cut to the CGT allowances raises less than half a billion. All changes that will largely hit the better off, but hardly game changers.What will change a lot is the structure of income tax. When the additional rate was introduced in 2010 only around 200,000 people paid it. Now anyone earning over £100,000 will pay at 60% on incomes up to £125,140, and at 45% over that. Altogether 4% of adults, around 2 million people, will be paying income tax at 60% or 45% by 2027-28. That’s more than were paying the higher 40% rate back in 1990. Meanwhile we expect there to be nearly 8 million people paying at that 40% rate.This is a big and fundamental change to our income tax system and a big increase in the marginal rate of tax faced by millions.Beyond that, there were plenty of tax changes, to all of which one must simply ask the question: where is the strategy? There are lots of things that need to be done to improve CGT. Why is cutting the allowance, which would barely make my top ten of required reforms, be the policy of choice? After an extensive review, business rates are being cut, with a big, supposedly temporary, cut for retail and hospitality. That latter cut is now going to be very hard to undo. I see no long-term direction or strategy at all. And what about the taxation of motoring? One can see why government is increasing VED on electric vehicles as their numbers grow. But how on earth is the driving of electric vehicles going to be taxed in the long run? And why reverse the cut to Stamp Duty, just about the only welcome measure in the mini Budget? I could go on.This increasingly matters: raising badly designed taxes will be more economically damaging than raising sensibly reformed ones.ConclusionHemmed in by rising interest payments and poor growth prospects, the chancellor decided to allow borrowing to rise, and to put off properly tough decisions for another couple of years. He may hope that things will look better by then, or perhaps that it will be somebody else’s problem.What we are really doing is reaping the costs of a long-term failure to grow the economy, the effects of population ageing, and high levels of past borrowing. After years of stagnation household incomes are set to fall and then recover only gradually, while taxes rise and public services continue to struggle.The truth is we just got a lot poorer. We are in for a long, hard, unpleasant journey; a journey that has been made more arduous that it might have been by a series of economic own goals. Mr Hunt appears to have recognised this. After years of cakeism, his colleagues, the opposition, and we the voters need to take that fact on board too.Related analysisImplications of the Autumn Statement 2022 and EFO for Wales and the Welsh GovernmentpresentationThis presentation summarises IFS's analysis of the outlook following the Autumn Statement and the implications for the Welsh Government's funding.28 November 2022Are we in a new era of austerity?podcastThis week, we speak with Gemma Tetlow, Chief Economist at the Institute for Government, and Carl Emmerson, Deputy Director at IFS.24 November 2022Autumn Statement 2022: IFS analysisevent\n18 November 2022 at 10:30\nIFS analysis of the Chancellor's announcements on the public finances, spending on public services, and the tax and benefit system.Autumn Statement 2022: IFS analysispresentationIFS analysis of the Chancellor's announcements on the public finances, spending on public services, and the tax and benefit system.18 November 2022Autumn Statement 2022 responsecommentAn initial response to the Autumn Statement from the IFS 17 November 2022The Autumn Statement 2022 explainedexplainerPaul Johnson provides an immediate response to the government's Autumn Statement.17 November 2022BackgroundBudget analysislanding page After each Autumn Statement, Budget and Spending Review, we publish analysis of the Chancellor's proposals and reforms.5 July 2022IFS Green Budget 2022collectionPolicy analysis from our IFS Green Budget 2022, funded by the Nuffield Foundation and in partnership with Citi.11 October 2022What happens in a Budget?explainerTypically, the government holds a Budget every year.
