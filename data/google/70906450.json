A cover-up of the events that led to the deaths has gone on fordecades and is still unravelling.\n\"It is shocking that more than 30 years after the Hillsborough disaster any club and our group of fans would be subject to such fundamental safety failings which have had such a devastating impact on so many,\" said Liverpool in a statement, which also called upon UEFA to enact the 21 recommendations of the report. \"But even more concerning is the realization that for families, friends and survivors of Hillsborough, Paris has only exacerbated their suffering.\"\nUnlike at Hillsborough, many of the events of last May were captured on camera phones by fans and journalists, possiblyforcing UEFA's hand.\nEdited by: Chuck Penfold\nMatt Pearson Sports reporter and editor@thisismpearsonFelix Tamsut Sports reporter@ftamsutSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisementSkip next section Explore moreExplore moreLiverpool fans unfairly blamed for Champions League chaos: French inquiryLiverpool fans unfairly blamed for Champions League chaos: French inquiryA report from the French Senate has concluded that Liverpool fans were not to blame for the chaos ahead of this year's Champions League final, but rather a \"string of dysfunctions\" in the organization.Sports07/13/2022July 13, 2022Champions League: Paris police chief admits to final 'failures' Champions League: Paris police chief admits to final 'failures' Paris police chief Didier Lallement has accepted a 'failure' in security operations during the Champions League final.
