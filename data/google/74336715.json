He has been framed for the murder of Minister D, and the Task Force is now tasked with bringing him in.The episode felt a bit rushed. I think it could have benefited from being a bit longer.The popular saying goes like this: \"there's no honour among thieves\" but Raymond Reddington is different. He goes all the trouble to honour his friends.From the first season to this last season this is one character that he demonstrated all through. It's one character that's difficult to find these days, loyalty!helpful•20tayadex-91136Sep 7, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateJuly 13, 2023 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguageEnglishProduction companiesDavis EntertainmentUniversal TelevisionSony Pictures Television StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime42 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio16:9 HDRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the French language plot outline for Raymond Reddington (No. 00): Pt. 1 (2023)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to explorePhotosTop Stars to Watch in 2024See the galleryListThe Most Anticipated Movies of 2024See the listListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

Current license plates are 4 numbers and then 3 letters (these are assigned consecutively regardless of the province).QuotesDembe Zuma: After I was shot, lying there on the street - I thought I was dying. And in that moment, I was okay with that being the end. With all the things going through my mind - I also thought of Raymond. More than anyone I've ever known, he's always been at peace with death. He says death is inevitable. It will come for us all. And that inevitability robs death entirely of its significance. What matters are the things that are not inevitable. The things we create. The things we find. The left we take when everything in our life is leading us right. How we live. I've always loved him for that. For his remarkable refusal to \"go quietly into that good night.\"Harold Cooper: The poem - by Dylan Thomas. \"Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\"SoundtracksA Mi Manera(Comme d'Habitude)Music by Claude François and Jacques RevauxFrench lyrics by Gilles ThibautPerformed by Gipsy KingsUser reviews101ReviewReviewFeatured review10/10 Epic endingThe show ended epic.Unfortunately, people had too high expectations in terms of answers that had already be given and that's the only reason for the low rating. The show often went artistic when they ended story arcs. And art is often interpreted in wrong ways or not understood by the majority of people.So, it's this time oh the show again.Watch it and make up your own mind.Pay attention to details. Rewatch, if unsure. They told a story over 10 seasons and never stopped telling it. Even the ending in this episode was told way before this episode!Kudos to everyone involved. A masterpiece.helpful•1312caroladaehnertJul 18, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateJuly 13, 2023 (United States)Country of originUnited StatesLanguagesEnglishSpanishFilming locationsNew York City, New York, USAProduction companiesDavis EntertainmentUniversal TelevisionSony Pictures Television StudiosSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime43 minutesColorColorSound mixStereoAspect ratio16:9 HDRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the French language plot outline for Raymond Reddington (No. 00): Good Night (2023)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"
