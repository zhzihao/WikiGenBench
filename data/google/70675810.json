Richburg Keith B. Richburg Contributing columnist writing on Asia, Europe and Africa Bio Follow September 24, 1989 KOMPONG SPEU, CAMBODIA, SEPT. 23 -- Following the failure by Cambodia's factional leaders to find a power-sharing formula for peace this summer, Cambodian civilians are once again bearing the brunt of a civil war now escalating in the countryside. Most of the victims are apolitical peasants who are attacked by guerrillas or step on land mines while tending cattle or working their rice fields. Most are women and children. Thu Mao, a 36-year-old woman who lost both legs to a guerrilla land mine, is one of them. She worries now about returning to her village of Ro Kakoh and wonders how she will care for her two small sons, aged 4 and 10, since her husband is away fighting at the border for the Phnom Penh government army. \"I don't want to go back home,\" she said, sitting in the hospital here in a crude wooden wheelchair, with her two sons on the floor beside her. \"I'm afraid the Khmer Rouge are in that village. But my house is there, my land, my water buffalo. I must go back.\" The renewed hostilities also came home to a 28-year-old unarmed militiaman named Koy Ton, while he was tending to his oxen in a field. Five Khmer Rouge guerrillas surrounded him, bound his hands behind his back and accused him of cooperating with the Vietnamese occupiers of Cambodia. Then they pressed a pistol behind his ear and shot him through the jaw. He survived by pretending to be dead until the guerrillas returned to their mountain redoubt. These are among the latest victims of what appears to be a stepped-up campaign of sabotage, violence and intimidation in the countryside by resistance guerrillas battling the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom Penh. The guerrillas are trying to exploit the scheduled withdrawal on Tuesday of the remaining Vietnamese occupation troops to increase their infiltration into Cambodia's interior in preparation for a major military offensive, possibly at the start of the December dry season, if not sooner. Kompong Speu Province, where the Cardamom and Elephant mountains stretch from the Thai border to just 50 miles southwest of Phnom Penh, appears to be one area where the Khmer Rouge have become most active. It was here that the remnants of Gen. Lon Nol's American-backed forces were able to hold out the longest when the Khmer Rouge communists first seized power in 1975, and the province now could provide the Khmer Rouge resistance a strategic infiltration route for armed incursions from the Thai border and an important staging ground for attacks on the capital itself. In the past few weeks of intensified warfare, most of the fighting between Khmer Rouge and government troops has centered on Pailin, a small border town that is a potentially lucrative source of gemstones. Khieu Kanarith, the editor of the Kampuchean, a weekly newspaper, and a national assembly member, recently visited Pailin, and said that Khmer Rouge guerrillas from bases in Thailand were firing up to 1,000 artillery shells a day on the town and on government positions in the nearby hills. He said the guerrillas have committed two divisions to the Pailin campaign, the 320th and 412th divisions. \"They want to take Pailin to boost morale and have a psychological effect on the population,\" he said. But Kanarith and other Cambodian officials, including Prime Minister Hun Sen, in recent days have tried to minimize the importance of Pailin to the government's overall strategy of trying to hold on to provincial capitals and key population centers even while conceding large areas of the countryside to the guerrillas. Kompong Speu Province, however, is another matter, and that is why the fighting here, while less intense than the battle for Pailin, carries more long-term significance for the government. Kompong Speu forms the key to the government's so-called \"Red Belt,\" a strategic defense perimeter around Phnom Penh designed to hold on to the capital in case the guerrillas make unexpected gains in the countryside. Here it is not a battle of artillery shells, like at Pailin, but a nasty guerrilla war where small units -- sometimes only five men -- have embarked on a campaign of terror, assassinating government officials and laying land mines along the roads and in fields. Hospital workers and military officials here report that in recent weeks, guerrillas appear to have stepped up their armed incursions. There has been a growing number of clashes between government forces and guerrillas, who escape with ease into the surrounding mountains. Dr. Heng Seng Hang, deputy director of the Red Cross hospital here, said the hospital currently had 39 victims of land mines as well as provincial troops wounded by Khmer Rouge shootings. One of the wounded interviewed there today was a 27-year-old provincial police officer named Hang Phan. His mobile unit of 30 police officers engaged in a shootout with about 15 Khmer Rouge guerrillas on Sept. 11, the third such encounter with the guerrillas this month -- more than in all of 1988, he said. The number of guerrillas in his area has not increased, he said, \"but their activity is more than before.\" Reth Em, 50, a deputy chief of the Kong Pisei district, about 15 miles south of here near the mountains, said there may be about 100 guerrillas in his small district, and they have assassinated local police officials, planted mines -- one of which blew his left leg off -- and attempted to burn down houses. Koy Ton, the militiaman shot in the jaw by the Khmer Rouge, said that \"the Khmer Rouge are not as strong as before, but they are doing more killing.\" He said the guerrillas now steal rice from villagers, kidnap young men to force them to join the guerrillas, and that he knows of at least one former village chief from a neighboring village who was dragged from his home and assassinated by the Khmer Rouge. \"All of the people are worried now because of the Khmer Rouge,\" he said from his hospital bed. \"If we are not careful, they will come in and destroy everything.\" Keith B.
