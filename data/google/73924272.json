In such a protective environment, it was hard for the director to capture the right expressions and gestures he wanted. Hence, the director asked the lead actor Leon Dai to push Bi unnoticeably, and Bi fell off a chair by accident. Bi was shocked, physically hurt, but he continued to film while crying hard. While Bi was left with a trauma, the accident did give the director a successful scene.ConnectionsReferences Easy Rider (1969)User reviews4ReviewReviewFeatured review7/10 A flawed but ultimately quietly affecting portrait of a young boy's search for his identityIn his sophomore feature film outing, director Chung Mong-Hong has crafted a quietly affecting drama that couldn't be more different from his debut- the urban black comedy \"Parking\". \"The Fourth Portrait\" is Chung's attempt to paint a bleak yet realistic look at one child's search for his identity amidst a turbulent society fraught with issues of poverty, domestic violence and foreign immigrants. That child is 10-year-old boy Xiang (newcomer Bi Xiao-hai), who in the film's brilliant opening scene, watches his ailing father pass away in hospital. From the very beginning, Chung lets his audience know that he is not out for cheap sentimentality- rather than portray Xiang as the pitiful child suddenly bereft of his father, Chung depicts him as quite the sharp fellow, smart enough to place a napkin over his father's mouth so he doesn't have to lean in all the time to know when his father has breathed his last breath. The dad's funeral reveals the first of four portraits drawn by Xiang, a somewhat cartoonish drawing of his father used as the funeral photo to largely amusing effect. Like the first portrait, the ensuing ones are a reflection of the people whose relationships have made a significant difference in his life- including a portly loutish thief nicknamed \"Big Gun\" (TV veteran Na Dow) who introduces him to a life of crime and his missing older brother whom he has mysterious dreams of. Both follow from social services' decision to send him to live with his estranged mom (Hao Lei), a prostitute now married to an abusive fishmonger (Leon Dai). Xiang feels acutely that he is unwelcome in the family, and so finds company instead with \"Big Gun\". The unlikely friendship is a welcome source of broad humour in the film, culminating in a hilarious scene where he paints the second portrait as part of his schoolwork. Whereas the first half of the film still had some levity, Chung takes the latter half in a decidedly darker course with the subplot of Chung's older brother's unsolved disappearance- also apparent from the nature of the third portrait. The change in tone is handled quite abruptly and there is a clear sense that Chung and his co-screenwriter Tu Hsiang-Wen have deliberately chosen to eschew narrative continuity in favour of episodic encounters of Xiang with various characters. As a result, the film feels uneven, a whole less than the sum of its distinct parts. Still if the film manages to remain consistently absorbing, it is due to the uniformly excellent performances of each and every one of its cast. Hao Lei is heart-wrenching as Xiang's mother, particularly in one scene where she relates her struggles to Xiang's teacher of surviving as a Chinese immigrant in a foreign land- her acting certainly deserving of the recent Golden Horse Best Supporting Actress win. But the biggest praise should be reserved for newcomer Bi Xiao-hai whose unaffected performance and quiet magnetism carries the entire film from start to finish. Along the way, Chung briefly hints at societal issues of poverty, domestic violence and immigration but doesn't dwell enough at them to make much of an impression. Instead, he keeps the film steadfastly focused as a slow-burning coming-of-age story of a young boy grappling with the changing relationships in his life. The last portrait is a befitting end to this journey, but viewers are well advised that it will take patience to get there. For those who do, you'll be rewarded with a moving portrait of finding one's identity.www.moviexclusive.comhelpful•51moviexclusiveDec 13, 2010Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inDetailsEditRelease dateOctober 22, 2010 (Taiwan)Country of originTaiwanLanguagesMandarinHokkienAlso known asThe Fourth PortraitProduction companies3 Ng FilmCream Film ProductionSee more company credits at IMDbProBox officeEditGross worldwide$11,254See detailed box office info on IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime1 hour 45 minutesColorColorRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the English language plot outline for Di si zhang hua (2010)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

What is the unvoiced violence that surrounds him in his new home ? One night, Xiang dreams of his elder brother who went missing, his subconscious works and brings to the surface a secret that questions the likelihood of his new stepfamily. Punctuated by four portraits drawn by children that are all chapters of the story,The Fourth Portraitconfirms Taiwanese Chung Mong-Hong’s talent, obviously influenced by a Taiwanese cinematographic masterpiece,Yi Yi,by Edward Yang (2000). Friends with the kindly school caretaker who is now retired and a young chubby petty thief full of life, the boy’s lonely emotional life exists on a plane somewhere between two generations as if his parents’ age group was foreign, forbidden. The beauty of the photography and the elegance of its editing contribute to the cocoon-like but yet dark atmosphere surrounding the new life that is imposed on Xiang.CG\nTitre françaisThe Fourth PortraitOriginal titleDi Si Zhang HuaScénarioChung Mong-Hong, Tu Hsiang-WenPhotoNagao NakashimaMontageLo Shih-ChingSonTu Duu-ChihInterprétationLeon Dai, Lei Hao, Shih-Chieh King, Terri Kwan, Na Dow, Xiao-Hai BiProductionCream Production / cream.film@msa.hinet.netProducteur déléguéShao-Chien TsengCoproductionRita Chuang, Hsiang-Wen Tu.Ventes internationalesGood Films Workshop : Rita Chuang, ritachuang@hotmail.com.Read moreFirst-Year Pupils(Avaliha)by Abbas KIAROSTAMIIran — 1985Door 3(Doa 3)by Kiyoshi KUROSAWAJapan — 1996Les arrivantsby Claudine BORIES, Patrice CHAGNARDFrance — 2010\nLES 3 CONTINENTS\n7 rue de l’Héronnière\nBP 43302\n44033 Nantes Cedex 1\nFrance\n+33 (0)2 40 69 74 14\nSubscribeto our newsletter\nContactCredits"
