After a dominant performance in the two four-day matches, where Pakistan Shaheens emerged victorious with a convincing 2-0 win over Zimbabwe A, they are now geared up for the limited-overs action.\nThe six 50-over matches will be played at the Harare Sports Club from 17 May to 27 May.\nThe 16-member Shaheens squad includes eight players who have already represented Pakistan in international cricket. Besides the eight international players,Shaheens will be hoping left-arm spinner Mehran Mumtaz to replicate his red-ball form in the white-ball series. He took 15 wickets across the two four-day matches, including 11 wickets in the first game at the Kwekwe Sports Club in Kwekwe.\nIn the batting department, Shaheens will be banking on Haseebullah, Mohammad Huraira and Omair Bin Yousuf – all of whom struck centuries in the two four-dayers – to take their form with the bat in the limited-overs series. Additionally,with the inclusion of Saim Ayub, who recently represented Pakistan in eight T20Is, the Shaheens have added more depth to their batting lineup. Saim’s presence is expected to bolster their batting order and provide stability in critical junctures of the game.\nOn the eve of the series, Saim Ayub said:“Representing the Pakistan men's team in T20Is has been an incredible experience, and I'm thrilled to bring that valuable experience to the Shaheens for this 50-over series against Zimbabwe Select.\n“I'm looking forward to the series with great anticipation. We have performed well in the four-day matches, but this is a new series and we respect Zimbabwe as opponents.\n“The preparations at the Harare Sports Club have been intense and focused. We have been working hard on all aspects of our game, from batting to bowling and fielding. The coaching staff has left no stone unturned to make sure we are well-prepared for the series.”\nPakistan Shaheens:Imran Butt (captain) (Lahore), Hussain Talat (vice-captain) (Lahore), Aamir Jamal (Islamabad), Abdul Wahid Bangalzai (Quetta), Haseebullah (Quetta), Kamran Ghulam (Peshawar), Mehran Mumtaz (Rawalpindi), Mir Hamza (Karachi), Mohammad Ali (Sialkot), Mohammad Huraira (Sialkot), Mubasir Khan (Islamabad), Omair Bin Yousuf (Karachi), Qasim Akram (Lahore), Rohail Nazir (wicketkeeper) (Islamabad), Saim Ayub (Karachi) and Shahnawaz Dahani (Larkana).\nPlayer Support Personnel– Aizaz Cheema (coach), Imran Abbas (manager), Abdul Rehman (team consultant), Saboor Ahmed (trainer), Muhammad Asad (physiotherapist) and Faisal Rai (team analyst).\nTour schedule:\n3-6 May – 1stFour-day match;KSC, Kwekwe (Pakistan Shaheens won by eight wickets)\n10- 13 May – 2ndFour-day match;MSC, Mutare (Pakistan Shaheens won by an innings and 41 runs)\n17 May – 1st50-over match; HSC, Harare\n19 May – 2nd50-over match; HSC, Harare\n21 May – 3rd50-over match; HSC, Harare\n23 May – 4th50-over match; HSC, Harare\n25 May – 5th50-over match; HSC, Harare\n27 May – 6th50-over match; HSC, Harare\nLatest\nJan 19, 2024\nFourth PCB Management Committee meeting held\nJan 19, 2024\nA review of Pakistan's history at the ICC U19 World Cup as the Saad Baig-led side commence their campaign tomorrow\nJan 19, 2024\nPCB introduces retainers for Women Panel of Umpires\nTwitter feed\nview all\nTweets by TheRealPCB\nLatest\nMedia Release\nMatch Reports\nFeatures\nMultimedia\nPodcast\nPhotos\nVideos\nPCB Ads\nCareer Opportunity\nCareer Archives\nCurrent Ad\nAd Archives\nAbout PCB\nContact Us\nFAQs\nMedia Account:\nLive Account:\nAll rights reserved by Pakistan Cricket Board © 2023\nDisclaimer | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Statement"
