We invite mining companies to explore and invest in the region,\" Salamuni said, adding Mineropar has some technical data on the location. Lead exploration had been on hold in the state \"due to the decrease in prices, which are now increasing,\" the Mineropar president explained. \"All metallic commodities are on the rise, including lead. It is becoming competitive.\" London Metal Exchange (LME) lead prices slumped as low as US$0.18/lb in 2000, notably lower than Monday's closing LME price of US$0.776/lb. Furthermore, Mineropar would \"provide support and open the doors for companies\" looking to invest in the Paraná, Salamuni said, adding the state company would be the interface between Paraná's environment institute and miners interested in lead exploration. Paraná produces coal and lime, among other minerals.

Little known on the aspects of its genesis, deposits and reserves, this diamond from of the Tibagi River basin and vicinity have been studied fromlong time and had several cycles of greater or lesser economic importance. The secondary source deposits, mined for many years by divers in heavy helmets provide intense debates as to the understanding of its genesis and feed on the folklore and local culture. The efforts to identify huge deposits and/or the primary sources of these diamonds led to a significant amount of geological information about this region, without however, resulting in prospective controls or more accurate geological models. Kimberlitic or lamproitic rocks have never been found in the region, aswell as there is no evidence ofmantelic minerals that could be linked to its genesis. The connection with the glacio-sedimentary rocks of Itararé Group appears to be the best possible source, however with no further evidence,. Considered to be of minor importance in diamond production of Brazil, these deposits have a historical context of scientific, socio-economic and cultural nature that begins to be treated as equity in the context of global geodiversity discussion. The correlation of scientific content and mineral history with social and cultural aspects is the path for the development of this unique context. This paper proposes the connection between geological data and cultural heritage constituted by the memory of diamond extraction in Paraná.

DerbyViewLate Paleozoic glacial deposits of Brazil: Paraná BasinChapterJan 2008 Antonio Carlos Rocha-Campos P. R. SantosJ.R. CanutoIn the early Pennsylvanian, glacial lobes draining from an ice sheet probably centered on the northern highlands of Namibia (Windhoek ice sheet) reached the eastern margin of the marine-flooded Parana Basin in southeastern and southern Brazil. Here, the glacier lobes extended at least 50 km across the depositional surface and terminated in a grounded tidewater system. The late Paleozoic paleolatitude of 40 degrees-50 degrees S of the Parana Basin is consistent with a temperate warm-based regime for the glaciers. Accumulation of glacially influenced sediments in the main northern depocenter of the rapidly subsiding cratonic depression may have been preceded by deposition of proglacial sandy deposits (Lagoa Azul Formation; terrestrial?). Glacier displacement seems to have been controlled mainly by glacial-estuarine or attenuated fjord-like coastal inlets. The glacial lobes initially moved over highly eroded Precambrian to early Paleozoic crystalline rocks, then middle Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, and eventually over their own deposits. Multiple advance-retreat phases left a carpet of subglacial and meltwater deposits both on land and along the basin margin, although the former deposits have been almost completely eroded away. Continued, albeit less intense, tectonic subsidence of the basin led to southward displacement of the depocenter and more widespread sediment deposition. An ice cap centered on the Rio Grande do Sul shield was drained by lobes that flowed along radially distributed preglacial valleys. On the western basin margin, reduced numbers of lobes not connected to a recognizable major ice mass (or masses) seem to have moved toward the southeast. Destabilized glacigenic debris (mainly sand, diamicton, and mud) accumulated proglacially on the basin ramp and moved downslope by mass-flow processes, resulting in thick and laterally extensive packages of sand and diamicton interbedded with laminites and shales (Lagoa Azul, Campo Mourao, and Taciba Formations). Ubiquitous dropstones in laminites and in massive silty-clayey diamictons point to deposition by rain-out from sediment plumes and icebergs. Repetitive sedimentary cycles consisting of alternations between limited terrestrial facies and intraformational evidence of subglacial processes indicate that glacial conditions in the Parana Basin persisted for 17-27 m.y. Glacial deposits are overlain by shallow-marine deltaic, coal-bearing sandstone of the Rio Bonito Formation and equivalent beds.ViewShow abstractMineral inclusions in Brazilian diamondsArticleDec 1975Phys Chem EarthHenry O.A. MeyerDarcy P. SviseroMinerals included in diamonds from several localities in Brazil have been examined. The minerals observed are olivine, enstatite, chrome-pyrope and pyrope-almandine. These minerals have similar compositions to those previously reported for inclusions from other worldwide localities. In addition rutile, ilmenite, zircon, quartz and pyrrhotite occur as inclusions. This is the first record of ilmenite and zircon in natural diamond. The ilmenite is unique compared to most kimberlite ilmenites in that it contains no appreciable content of magnesium. The presence of quartz as an inclusion is unusual.ViewShow abstractPatterns of Late Paleozoic deglaciation in the Paran?? Basin, BrazilArticleOct 1996PALAEOGEOGR PALAEOCL P. R. Santos Antonio Carlos Rocha-CamposJ.R. CanutoThe Itararé Subgroup (Middle Carboniferous-Early Permian) of the Paraná Basin of southeastern Brazil contains the thickest, most extensive and one of the longest records of late Palaeozoic glaciation in all of the Gondwana supercontinent.Glacially controlled deposition started as early as the Middle Carboniferous when lobate termini of ice streams from the Windhoek Ice Sheet (WIS), and Rio Grande do Sul and Asunción ice caps moved into the Paraná Basin. Lobes reached sea-level and advanced grounded at least as far as 200 km into the basin, stabilizing as tidal/intertidal margins.Glaciation and glacial sedimentation occurred penecontemporaneously with the transgressive phase of the late Palaeozoic tectonic cycle of the Paraná Basin, while Gondwana was gradually moving away from the South Pole. Evolution involved complex interaction of tectonic, palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic factors. Initial flooding of the basin by an epicontinental sea in the Middle Carboniferous may have provided moisture necessary for the growth of glaciers. Conversely, episodes of sea-level rise probably affected the stability of marine glaciers.The palaeoclimatic setting for the WIS and other ice masses at the margins of the Paraná Basin was mostly temperate.Multiple ice advances are evidenced by subglacial tillites resting on striated and/or glaciotectonized basement and deformed glacigenic sediments identified at different stratigraphic levels in the Itararé Subgroup. Glaciation reached its maximum expansion sometime between the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian, gradually diminishing and vanishing in the late Early Permian.The reconstructed palaeogeographic evolution favors a model of irregular melt back of ice masses, particularly along the eastern margin of the Paraná Basin, in analogy with the deglacial pattern of the Pleistocene Laurentide ice sheet, in North America.Retreat of marine glaciers was mostly associated with relatively simple accumulations, or complex build-ups of ice contact/proglacial facies associations in glacial estuarine embayments. Fast retreat was mainly controlled by decoupling associated with sea-level rise and intense calving.In the terrestrial environment, more fragmentary evidence shows that retreat may have involved several mechanisms including downwasting of stagnant/inactive ice margins and destabilization by surging of glaciers moving over deformable sediments.Highstand sea-level following ice wastage is often marked by widespread deposition of relatively thin marine beds. At least four stratigraphically different basinwide marine “horizons” are recognized. Isostatic rebound of deglaciated margins of the Paraná Basin is recorded by transition from deep marine beds to shallowing/coarsening upward, prograding sequences of littoral/fluvio-deltaic facies basinwards, sourced from raised basin margins. Eventually, upon emersion, these constituted platforms for interglacial and postglacial peat development.Although glaciation lasted for a long time, glacial sedimentation alternated with relatively long periods of intense and widespread subaerial and subaquatic (submarine) reworking of previously deposited glacigenic sediments and deposition of “normal”, non-glacial sediments, that comprise the bulk of the Itararé Subgroup sequence. Thin coal beds, which locally rest on fossil soils, denote climatic amelioration during these interglacial phases.ViewShow abstractRecommended publicationsDiscover moreArticleBetween mountain naturalization and identity patrimonialization : Ambivalence of the representations...January 2013 Mauricette FournierThe present article suggests analyzing the representations of Cantal (which is a rural, low mountain range department, located in Massif Central), in various published topographical, in particular Chamina who was one of the major actors in the development of hiking and green tourism in the area.

Documentation to most of the remaining traditional marketplaces on its current state are also being performed. The findings suggested that although the numbers of traditional marketplaces in Bandung, Indonesia are still plenty, with population vs. traditional marketplaces ratio of 60.000:1, with its current shape and order, the number of traditional marketplaces is prone to reduction and extinction in the future. Traditional marketplaces as one of the local culture and heritage identity of an area should be preserved. This study is among one of the pioneer studies to list and locate traditional marketplaces in Indonesia, particularly in Bandung area. In parallel with this study, the authors also have started to conduct analysis to identify the factors that affect the traditional marketplaces decay. It is expected that these research findings will be useful for the stakeholders to monitor and take precautionary or active actions to save traditional marketplaces in Bandung, Indonesia.Read moreDiscover the world's researchJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.Join for free ResearchGate iOS AppGet it from the App Store now.InstallKeep up with your stats and moreAccess scientific knowledge from anywhere orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
