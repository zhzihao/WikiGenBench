What’s this place all about? At 204,000 square feet, the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum in Doha is one of the largest sports museums on the planet, and the first Arab institution to join the Olympic Museums Network. Spanish architect Joan Sibina designed the museum as two separate structures: The main building follows the arc of the historic Khalifa International Stadium, to which it is anchored. Attached to that is a spiraled access building inspired by the Olympic rings—and the rings glow blue, yellow, white, green, and red at night. The museum entrance looks like a running track and decorative mashrabiya, or Islamic-style latticework, provides shade on hot days.A museum's permanent collection is its defining feature: How was this one? The museum is carved into seven sections, starting with a history of sport that journeys from eighth century B.C. to present day. The state-of-the-art displays incorporate splashy audio-visual components and interactive digital simulations. There’s a virtual archery setup, for instance, where you can practice shooting arrows like an ancient Greek. Other highlights include a reconstructed Roman racing chariot, a penny-farthing bicycle from 1882, and wooden clubs for pahlevani, an ancient Iranian ritual played in an octagonal pit surrounded by spectators. One of the more prized possessions is a soccer ball from England’s 1888 FA Cup Final, where West Bromwich Albion beat Preston North End 2-1. Another space is devoted to commemorative Olympic paraphernalia including programs, pennants, and quirkier items such as stereoscopic glasses (Helsinki, 1952) and a beer stein (Sarajevo, 1984).The museum’s “Hall of Athletes” profiles 90 trailblazers, each with a dedicated display case and sporting mementos. Some are household names like Brady and Bolt; others—like Japanese sumo wrestler Taiho Koki, French windsurfer Antoine Albeau, and American fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad—are heroes within their niche. Paralympians make appearances, too: A section devoted to Swiss cyclist Heinz Frei features his Beijing 2008 racing wheelchair.What's on display, or interactive? Spread over three floors, the hall is spacious enough to accommodate life-size artifacts—notably a Formula 1 race car and the bobsled used by the Jamaican team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. (Yes, the one Cool Runnings was based on.) Many are autographed, including a baseball bat from Babe Ruth, boxing glove from Manny Pacquaio, and the tennis racquet Steffi Graf swung at the French Open in 1999, when she beat longstanding rival Monica Seles in the semi-finals.While most of the museum focuses on global sporting culture, the section on Qatar’s own victories is not to be missed. In addition to telling the story behind the country’s first gold medals (won by weightlifter Fares El Bakh and high jumper Mutaz Barshim at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics), it digs into traditional Qatari sports like falconry, pearl diving, and camel racing. Entertaining as it is to learn about dromedary sprints, the museum saves the best for last. “The Activation Zone” features 18 interactive stations designed to measure one’s “physical literacy” across five key pillars: Fortitude, Vitality, Collaboration, Control, and Quickness (reactions and speed).Visitors strap on a 3-2-1 wristband and wander through six spaces inspired by familiar Qatari environs. In the “park” setting, a hand cycle assesses one’s endurance—seeing how far you can pedal in 30 seconds. At the “beach,” a paddle board simulation measures core body control. In the “desert,” you test your upper body strength by pushing the back half of a Jeep out of faux sand.At the end of the visit, swipe the wristband at a kiosk to collect your individualized profile. In addition to logging your best scores, it compares your physical literacy to other museum-goers of the same age and suggests sports it thinks you would excel at. It even links to an app that makes recommendations for local clubs, coaches, and facilities offering those activities.Exhibits keep us coming back. What can we expect? There are no seasonal exhibitions on display as of yet (pre-World Cup).What did you make of the crowd? The museum is spacious enough that you won’t feel crowded—although queues may form at popular stations in the Activation Zone. Soccer star David Beckham, who visited the museum shortly before its opening, said this was his favorite area. The stations make for good people watching, as men in thobes and ghutras test their hand strength by white knuckling the handlebars of a pseudo-motorcycle and entire families leap into the air during simulated wave jumps.On the practical tip, how were the facilities? Start on the top floor—in the section titled “A Global History of Sport”—and work your way down. The museum is laid out in a chronological fashion, first walking visitors through the history of sports, then introducing all things Olympics. This is followed by “The Hall of Athletes,” spread out over three floors; text-heavier galleries digging into traditional Qatari sports and the country’s climb to international sporting notoriety; and, finally, “The Activation Zone.” The layout makes sense when you follow it as it was intended but can be confusing if you try to jump around. The museum is wheelchair-friendly (though not every station in the interactive Activation Zone is), and there are both escalators and elevators. At a whopping 204,000 square feet, you’ll certainly get your steps in. Note: There are no guided tours as of yet.Gift shop: obligatory, inspiring—or skip it? A gift shop on the second floor sells sportswear and apparel, kits from local football teams, prints of vintage Olympic posters, kid-sized cricket bats, finger paints in the colors of the Olympic Rings, and coffee table tomes like Brigitte Lacombe’s Hey’Ya: Arab Women in Sport. It’s nicely presented and touches upon a wide range of sports, from cycling to speed skating to gymnastics ribbon dancing. There are lots of clever last-minute cash register buys, too, including flag pins representing dozens of countries and FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022-branded face masks.Is the café worth a stop? A casual fine dining restaurant, called Naua, is still in the works. Until that opens for a proper sit-down meal, museum-goers can pick up salads, sandwiches, infused teas, and cold-pressed juices at a third-floor café. The menu concepts at both eateries were designed by Tom Aikens, a U.K.-born Michelin-star chef and avid marathon runner, so they veer toward the healthy and wholesome. (Think raw spinach salads with wild rice and dried fruit and beetroot detox juice.) If it’s not too hot, grab a table outside: The al fresco seating wraps halfway around the building.Any advice for the time- or attention-challenged? Absolutely! The must-see list includes the dramatically lit gallery spotlighting every torch from the Summer and Winter Olympic Games from 1936 onward; a boxing glove signed by Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad Ali, from the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, where the heavyweight champion won gold; a basketball autographed by the Dream Team (including Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Scottie Pippen) at 1992’s Tournament of the Americas in Portland; and the soccer ball used by Brazilian forward Pelé to score the 1,000th goal of his career.Location MapContactKhalifa International Stadium, Aspire Zone, DohaQatarhttps://qm.org.qa/en/about-us/3-2-1-qatar-olympic-and-sports-museum/More To DiscoverhotelsactivitiesrestaurantsshopsMarsa Malaz Kempinski$$ | Qatar, Doha, The Pearl - Doha Costa Malaz Bay, Marina DriveA pink palace on Qatar’s game-changing Pearl Island complex.Book NowPowered By: ExpediaMondrian Doha$$$ | Qatar, Doha, West Bay LagoonSimply a work of art.Book NowPowered By: ExpediaMandarin Oriental, Doha$$ | Qatar, Doha, Barahat Msheireb StreetEasily one of the best spots in the city to watch the sunset.Book NowPowered By: ExpediaThe Ritz-Carlton, DohaQatar, Doha,A relaxing oasis in an on-the-rise Persian Gulf capital.Souq Waqif Boutique Hotels by TivoliQatar, Doha, Souq WaqifBook NowPowered By: ExpediaJumeirah Dar Al Masyaf at Madinat Jumeirah$$ | Dubai, Madinat Jumeirah - King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud StThis sprawling family resort is designed to resemble traditional Arab summer houses interconnected by canals.Book NowPowered By: ExpediaChevronChevronPinterestFacebookSnapchatInstagramXCondé Nast Traveler does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
