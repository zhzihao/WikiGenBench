He replied: “We are now rolling out the Gaza Nakba. From an operational point of view, there is no way to wage a war – as the IDF seeks to do in Gaza – with masses between the tanks and the soldiers.”Israel’s two key goals of Hamas war are set to collideThe voice of Israeli Arabs opposing the war is the voice of democracyThere's only one viable postwar strategy for Gaza, but Netanyahu has other plansWhen asked again whether this was the “Gaza Nakba”, Dichter – a member of the security cabinet and former Shin Bet director – said “Gaza Nakba 2023. That’s how it’ll end.” When later asked if this means Gaza City residents won’t be allowed to return, he replied: “I don’t know how it’ll end up happening since Gaza City is one-third of the Strip – half the land’s population but a third of the territory.”The Gaza Strip’s settlements were evacuated by Israel in 2005 during a unilateral disengagement helmed by then-prime minister Ariel Sharon. Following coalition members’ declarations regarding reversing this move, Open gallery viewPalestinians in Gaza evacuating southwards, on Friday.Credit: Fatima Shbair/APPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked on Friday if he supports Israeli resettlement in the Gaza Strip after the war. “No, I don’t think so,” he answered, “I said I want full security control. Gaza must be demilitarized. I don’t think (resettlement) is a realistic goal, I’m saying it plainly.”Netanyahu, who spoke at a press conference alongside Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and minister Benny Gantz, added that he won’t give up control over security in Gaza “under any circumstances.” In response to a question about the war’s aftermath and the possibility of the Palestinian Authority controlling the Strip, he said: \"I repeat, we will have total security control, with the ability to enter whenever we want to eliminate any terrorists who re-emerge. I can say what won’t happen – there will be no Hamas.\"\"I can say what else will not happen – there will not be a civil authority there that educates its children to hate the State of Israel, to kill Israelis, to eliminate the State of Israel. There cannot be an authority there that pays the families of murderers. There cannot be an authority there whose leader has not yet condemned the terrible massacre more than 30 days after it occurred,\" added Netanyahu.Click the alert icon to follow topics: 2023 Israel-Gaza War Benjamin Netanyahu NakbaCommentsIn the NewsGantz, Break With Netanyahu and Fight for an Early Election'Strategic Error': Israeli Minister Says War Gov't Prevented Preemptive Strike in LebanonIsraeli Soldier Dies of Wounds Sustained in Gaza FightingRoyal Caribbean, MSC Cancel Cruises Due to Red Sea AttacksIran's Missile Attack on Pakistan Was Meant to Send a Message to the Whole RegionPeace Of Mind: Moving To Asssisted Living Paid by Attorney Rakefet ShfaimICYMIJews Shouldn't Celebrate the Resignation of Harvard University's PresidentA Jewish-Arab Partnership Is Building a Young New Peace Camp in IsraelIsraelis Can't Understand How They Could Be Accused of GenocideIsrael Isn't Committing a Genocide, but It Has GenocidairesTwo Gaza Wars: Why the Gulf Between Israelis and Outsiders Is So Vast, and JarringThe 'Eternal Boys' of Ancient RomehaaretzFacebook Twitter Android Apple Email RSS SubscribeNewslettersTermsContact UsMy CookiesAdvertiseAccessibilityReport an issueAccessibility manifestDownload App© Haaretz Daily Newspaper Ltd.

If carried out, that would mean the territory’s entire population would have to cram into the southern half of the 40-kilometer (25-mile) strip.An Israeli spokesperson, Jonathan Conricus, said the military would take “extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians” and that residents would be allowed to return when the war is over.Israel has long accused Hamas of using Palestinians as human shields. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel wanted to separate Hamas militants from the civilian population.“So those who want to save their life, please go south,” he said at a news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.\nThe Associated Press\nap.org\nCareers\nAdvertise with us\nContact Us\nAccessibility Statement\nCookie Settings\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nMore From AP News\nAbout\nAP News Values and Principles\nAP’s Role in Elections\nAP Leads\nAP Definitive Source Blog\nAP Images Spotlight Blog\nAP Stylebook\ntwitter\ninstagram\nfacebook"
