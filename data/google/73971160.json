Even without those scenes the story can work and believe me this time the stories are fine.The first story must not be Rated A if it was not in this movie. The story contains nothing in the name of lust.The second Story portray some kind of illegal behavior but still you don't sympathize with any of the characters.The third story in which Tamannah and Vijay is there wants to surprise you but fails miserably. What you can predict was there in the end and you are left unsatisfied there.The fourth story which is predictable also leaves you puzzled about the name of this movie.Atleast try to justify the title of movie.helpful•229chandrabhanusolankiJun 29, 2023Top picksSign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendationsSign inFAQ16How long is Lust Stories 2?Powered by AlexaDetailsEditRelease dateJune 29, 2023 (Hong Kong)Country of originIndiaOfficial siteOfficial NetflixLanguageHindiAlso known as愛慾四重奏2Filming locationsMumbai, Maharashtra, IndiaProduction companiesFlying Unicorn EntertainmentRSVPSee more company credits at IMDbProTechnical specsEditRuntime2 hours 12 minutesColorColorSound mixDolby DigitalRelated newsContribute to this pageSuggest an edit or add missing contentTop GapWhat is the German language plot outline for Lust Stories 2 (2023)?AnswerSee more gapsLearn more about contributingEdit pageMore to exploreListJanuary Picks: All the Best Movies and ShowsSee our picksPhotosThe Greatest Character Actors of All TimeSee the galleryListJames' 5 Picks for JanuarySee the full listRecently viewedYou have no recently viewed pagesGet the IMDb AppSign in for more accessSign in for more accessGet the IMDb AppHelpSite IndexIMDbProBox Office MojoIMDb DeveloperPress RoomAdvertisingJobsConditions of UsePrivacy PolicyYour Ads Privacy ChoicesIMDb, an Amazon company© 1990-2024 by IMDb.com, Inc.Back to top"

(courtesy: YouTube)Bursts and thrusts of passion - off-camera, on it or merely alluded to - are peppered across Lust Stories 2, but these paroxysms are by no means all that the four tales are about.Two of the stories in the Netflix film centre on lust as a tool of power, a means of entrapment or an act of vengeance. This pair of tales is animated by vengeance seekers. Another segment has two women - one a corporate exec, the other a domestic help - squaring off in an unusual and searching spiral of voyeurism and arousal.One story is set in an oneiric, beguiling little town where a chance encounter between a man and his former wife, who went missing years ago, triggers renewed but portentous ardour.Exciting as that may sound, Lust Stories 2 does not tee off too well. The opening story (Made for Each Other, directed and co-written by R. Balki) delivers neither pleasure nor joy. A fluffy and sterile take on the centrality of good sex in a happy marriage, it steers clear of the more complex zones that the other stories explore.The first segment is, however, salvaged a touch by Neena Gupta as a disruptive granny who trots out refreshingly unabashed ideas about mating game rules.Made for Each Other is about a just-engaged couple, Veda (Mrunal Thakur) and Arjun (Angad Bedi). At the behest of the girl's grandmother who believes that no marriage can survive bad sex, they decide to put their \"compatibility in the bedroom\" to the test before they get legally hitched.The no-nonsense naani insists that only Mount Fuji-like eruptions would count as peak performance. While the young couple is at it - all the action takes place behind closed hotel doors - the old woman turns her attention to her 52-year-old son (Hemant Kher) and 48-year-old daughter-in-law (Kanupriya Pandit).Rekindle the spark that has gone out of your marriage, she says to the girl's parents, all the while talking up the great sex that she had with her husband till the day he was alive.It is left to the film's second part, Konkona Sen Sharma's The Mirror, to turn on the heat and help Lust Stories 2 put the drab kick-off behind it. What follows are three successive segments that are significantly steamier and more enticing.The Mirror, which examines female erogeneity in a new light, sends the film into a tangled, twisted terrain as it examines carnal pleasure and its frequently puzzling manifestations.Sen Sharma's segment holds up a mirror to the inner worlds of two dissimilar women - successful and single professional Isheeta (Tillotama Shome) and her trusted all-purpose maid Seema (Amruta Subhash) - and probes the upshots of a piquant situation that arises when the former stumbles upon a startling scene when she returns from work one afternoon.Isheeta is thrown off at first, unsure what to make of what she has inadvertently barged into. But she quickly begins to see what is before her eyes almost every day as an opportunity to liven up her dull, sexless life, if only by proxy.The script by Pooja Tolani and Sen Sharma looks at the dynamics of female desire in two different physical spaces - the cramped tenement that Seema lives in with her husband Kamal (Shrikant Yadav) and two children and the high-end apartment that belongs to Isheeta but of which the maid has a free run in the daytime.Powered by two magnetic performances from Shome and Subhash, The Mirror maps the deepest impulses of the two women as they are drawn into a vicarious 'relationship' that stimulates them beyond their imagination and unlocks an ineffable degree of sexual frisson.Sujoy Ghosh's Sex with Ex, starring Tamannaah Bhatia and Vijay Varma as a long-disappeared woman and her one-time husband and corporate honcho respectively, is a genre exercise that embraces both the coital and the confounding in its portrait of a relationship that ended abruptly in mysterious circumstances.Employing a bright colour palette that lends the backdrop the feel of a dreamscape, the story is about Vijay Chauhan (Varma), a father of two boys, who is on his way to meet a clandestine squeeze when he is summoned back to the office for a board meeting. He turn around but drives his vintage car into a tree to avoid hitting a cyclist.The search for a car mechanic leads Vijay into a town where he spots an enigmatic and seductive woman who has the face of his ex-wife Shanti (Bhatia) who vanished without a trace. But is she quite who he thinks she is?A mean, tough-talking cop is not far from the scene, old habits (Vijay drinks coffee without milk, the lady tea with milk) have still not been forgotten and a befuddling brassiere size raises a question in the man's mind. Even as the conundrums multiply, sparks fly between the two.The lady advises the accidental visitor not to tarry. You should leave, she says repeatedly. The man does not heed the advice. You owe me an explanation, he insists. The story leaves a strand or two unexplained but it is tantalising enough to hold one's attention.A high-wattage Tamannaah sizzles and glows; Vijay Varma absorbs the heat without melting and even generates some of his own. The chemistry between the two actors enlivens the intriguing encounter between two people who at first flush appear to be from different planets.Amit Ravindernath Sharma's Tilchatta, provides a fitting end to a quartet that, after the flat and dreary domesticity of Made for Each Other, forays into themes of pride and revenge, suppressed longings, long buried secrets, corrosive jealousies, feudal oppression and desperate bids for freedom.Scripted by Saurabh Chaudhary and the director, the pitch-dark Tilchatta is fronted by Kajol in the role of a powerless queen of a palace and a kingdom that has clearly seen better days. Kumud Mishra plays a feudal lord who rides roughshod over women, be they in his bed or elsewhere.The two reside in a Rajasthan haveli, a toxic bubble that conceals many an unsavoury secret. In the drama about lacerations of heart and body, confinement and the desire for freedom provide the narrative crux. Three individuals, driven by ambition and a yearning for autonomy, plot to escape their fate.Devyani Singh (Kajol), treated like a doormat by Suraj Singh (Mishra), is determined to get her own back by sending her son Ankur (Zeeshan Nadaf) to England. She hires a new cleaning lady, Rekha (Anushka Kaushik). Inevitably, the lecherous Suraj Singh begins to lust for her. The harried queen resolves to make the most of the situation in her quest for freedom for herself and her son.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.comKajol's solid performance lends the story a meaty centre. Kumud Mishra is as impressively flawless - and effortless - as ever. The two younger actors, Anushka Kaushik and Zeeshan Nadaf, deserve special mention. They are as good as anyone else in Lust Stories 2.From the pulpy and playful to the putrid and puckered, Lust Stories 2, pretty much like its predecessor, is a mixed bag. The storytelling isn't always lusty. But when it is, there is enough zest in here for the occasional creases not to get in the way.Cast:Kajol, Tamannaah, Vijay Varma, Amruta Subhash, Angad Bedi, Kumud Mishra, Mrunal Thakur, Neena Gupta, Tillotama ShomeDirector:Amit Sharma, Konkona Sen Sharma, R Balki, Sujoy GhoshAlso ReadLust Stories 2 BTS: Find Someone Who Looks At You The Way Tamannaah Looks At Vijay VarmaTillotama Shome Talks About The \"Battle To Be Reimagined As Anything But\" Domestic HelpDone With Lust Stories 2 ?

I always find anthologies more intriguing and engaging than a 3-hour-long feature film, more so because they present different stories joined by a common theme, and rarely digress. It's been five years since Indian audiences were treated to four neatly packed stories in form of an anthology called Lust Stories. In its second edition -- now streaming on Netflix -- the four shorts come together to serve a heady blend of love, desire, sex, shame, guilt, revenge, and betrayal, all centred around the theme of lust. Just like its predecessor, Lust Stories 2 primarily narrates the stories with a female's point of view. Exploring modern-day relationships through the lens of sexuality and physical desires, the anthology has been directed by four skilled filmmakers -- R Balki, Konkona Sen Sharma, Sujoy Ghosh and Amit Sharma, and each brings a different perspective on how a woman's sexuality is commonly looked at in our society, and what needs to change. (Also read: Lust Stories movie review: Netflix’s new film undresses repressed Indian sexuality) Lust Stories 2 stars Tamannah Bhatia and Vijay Varma in one of the shorts. The opening film is by R Balki where two families are trying to get their children -- Mrunal Thakur and Angad Bedi married, but the matriarch of the family, played by Neena Gupta, feels one must have 'sexual compatibility' to be able to determine if they're marrying the right person and whether it will last for long. Balki infuses the otherwise complex subject that's often looked at as a taboo, with a lot of humour. The short appears to be a subtle take on all those families who pretend to be extremely modern and forward-thinking, allowing their children to choose a partner of their choice, but the moment you mention 'sex', there's awkwardness and complete radio silence. Though Neena says her dialogues with utmost sincerity and straightforwardness, they sound too funny coming from a daadi. Amazon Sale season is here! Splurge and save now! Click here There might be an understated sense of discomfort when she compares sexual climax and Mt Fuji eruption or discusses details of her bedroom life with her granddaughter, but Neena brings so much ease and flair to this part that it almost turns relatable. Mrunal and Neena's camaraderie is endearing but something remains amiss when it comes to Mrunal's expressions and dialogue delivery. Even Mrunal and Angad look cute together each time they are running in the corridor of a hotel before entering their luxury suite, but there's only that much about their chemistry that one can talk about. Angad, I felt, deserved to get a little more screen time and a few dialogues at least. Neena brings up the forbidden topic in the most hilarious way and leaves you with a smile. Moving away from Balki'a familial setup is Konkona's short that switches the mood to a more intense, darker, and deeper tale where women's desires remain hidden and never get spoken of publicly. Between Tillotama Shome as a working woman living alone, and her house help Amruta Subhash, it's almost impossible to choose who's the better actor. The finesse they bring to their characters is beyond perfection. In the earlier Lust Stories, we saw Bhumi Pednekar play the role of a househelp who gets into a sexual relationship with the bachelor she's working for. Here, Amruta takes things a notch higher with many more layers and dimensions added to her part. Tillotama, in some of the most difficult scenes never looks hesitant and delivers a convincing act. My favourite of the lot in terms of story, narrative, screenplay and aesthetics, Konkona's segment effortlessly highlights the class divide, and shows how, when it comes to lust, it knows no caste, colour, or gender. The way the director makes her characters talk to you through their silence is the most impressive bit that leaves an impact. There's so much unsaid for one to assume and conclude, yet Konkona doesn't leave room for any doubts. Moreover, the way Konkona makes both her protagonists look so comfortable in their skin tells a lot about the understanding a director has on the subject they are touching. There's a scene where Amruta is sleeping with her kids and husband in her dungy and cramped house, and then she smiles thinking about her day that went by, it leaves you with so many thoughts. Beautifully written and equally well shot sequence. It's a very brave and courageous attempt at letting women come to terms with their sexual desires and accept what's real and not feel ashamed of anything. And this short sends across the message so subtly yet strongly. Perhaps one of the much talked about and anticipated short, Sujoy Ghosh's segment, I found the weakest of all. Other than the whole buzz around Vijay Varma and Tamannaah Bhatia's kiss and chemistry, the film never draws you in or has anything to keep you hooked. I was startled to see such average acts by both actors who are otherwise known for their great acting chops and look amazingly good onscreen. Neither their characters strike a chord nor anything they say leaves any impact. The segment starts off looking quite promising but loses direction mid-way and by the end of it, starts to look quite lame and lustreless. What really caught my eye in this segment was the extremely odd-looking set that was created with countryside feel to it. With clouds, trees and houses that look straight out of a kids cartoon book, I didn't quite understand if that was a conscious choice to give that kind of a feel and vibe to the whole setting, which was highly distracting to say the least. As for the story and how it unfolds, Ghosh tried to build a lot off drama but by the time the big reveal happens, it's too late and it almost fails to keep you invested. In fact, the plot that's so convoluted could have been less complicated to make a point it wanted to. Tamannaah and Vijay shown to be a couple having an extra marital affair are refreshing and you feel some sparks only in that portion when they're together. The short needed more of a backstory and looks very rushed from start to end. They say best is saved for the last, and I had no complains with Amit Sharma's short with Kajol and Kumud Mishra bringing their A-game forward. It might not be extraordinary in terms of story but the twist in the climax does the trick... It's just brilliantly conceptualised. Amit, who has earlier helmed Badhaai Ho which somewhat touched upon sexual desires among elderly couples, moves away from that territory and tries something that's way more complex and intense in Lust Stories 2. There's a subplot with sex workers that gives weight to this segment and elevates it to a tale beyond just sexual violence among couples. After a point, the story might seem predictable, but I must credit the director here for not giving away the climax and build the hype for that ultimate moment. As compared to all other protagonist in the previous three shorts, Kajol is perhaps the most docile, but she has suffered the most, and fate doesn't really favour her even when she shows courage to take a bold step. She is just so flawless onscreen and says a lot with the least words. Kumud Mishra as the torchbearer of ancient patriarchy is terrific and makes you hate his character, a sign that he convinces with his performance. Together, their scenes make you uncomfortable and evoke a sense of helplessness. The short very well succeeds in making the point it sets out to. Putting these shorts together as one, it's a 2-hour-long interesting take on women's sexuality being discussed from their perspective. A few hits and a few misses, Lust Stories 2 has more substance than the drama and antics that can take away from the story. Watch it on Netflix for some brilliant performances and a message that needs to be sent across.
