{"id": 70739382, "key": "Carol City murders", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol%20City%20murders", "text": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978. The murders were committed by American mass murderer and serial killer John Errol Ferguson (February 27, 1948 – August 5, 2013) who murdered at least eight people but is believed to have killed up to twelve. He was aided in six of the murders by two accomplices: Marvin Francois (January 18, 1946 – May 29, 1985) and Beauford White (October 29, 1945 – August 28, 1987).\n\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, Francois, and White entered a drug house in Carol City where they tied up a total of eight people and shot all of them in the head execution-style. Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.\n\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.\n\nBackgrounds\n\nJohn Errol Ferguson\n\nFerguson, the fourth oldest of eight children, had been known to psychiatrists since he was 10. His father died when he was 13 and his mother had managed to take care of the children on her own. Ferguson dropped out of school after repeating 9th grade three times. Ferguson had his first police encounter when he was 13 after being caught driving someone else's car without their consent. He would continue to get in trouble with the police throughout his youth. In 1969, Ferguson tried to kill a police officer after a traffic stop. He disarmed officer Edward Hartman, ordered him on his knees, and told him to beg for his life. Hartman complied, but also slipped a revolver out of his boot. Ferguson fired four shots at Hartman but missed all of them. Hartman then shot Ferguson four times.\n\nIn 1975, a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed John Ferguson as \"dangerous to himself and others ... homicidal ... a man who should not be released under any circumstances.\" Another psychiatrist said Ferguson's potential for recovery was minimal and that the probability of him returning to a life of crime was very high. He described Ferguson as \"explosive ... a dangerous person who cannot cope with day to day living.\" Ferguson bragged to his friends that he had feigned insanity and misled the doctors. A woman who knew him later said, \"He was into psychology. He told us he psyched them out. He'd say things like 'See that airplane flying in the room?'\"\n\nAfter repeatedly escaping from a hospital, Ferguson, who had previously been acquitted of six robberies and two assaults on the grounds of insanity, was sent to the more secure Florida State Hospital. In June 1976, doctors said Ferguson's treatment was complete and that further hospitalization was not necessary. Ferguson was sent to Miami to face charges of resisting arrest after a hospital escape. Although a psychiatrist warned that he was \"unpredictable and a danger to himself and others\", a judge ruled Ferguson competent and later accepted a guilty plea. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of probation, and released 225 days later.\n\nMarvin Francois\nFrancois, whose parents were not married, had an impoverished upbringing. His father was a deadbeat heroin addict who brought other addicts into the home to take heroin in front of his son and beat Francois when he would not fight with the other children. Francois's mother was a sex worker who did not do much for her son. She married, but Francois's stepfather abused him. Although Francois did not finish school, he did obtain his GED.\n\nBeauford White\nWhite had a lengthy criminal record dating back to July 1963, and was on parole for assault with intent to commit rape at the time of the murders.\n\nPreliminary murders\nOn October 30, 1974, James Ward, a 40-year-old mental hospital escapee, was murdered. His body was dumped in Collier County and he was killed by a shotgun blast. On November 1, the body of another man named Joseph Walters was found near railroad tracks in Miami by a freight train employee. Walters had also been killed by a shotgun blast but had additionally been shot repeatedly with a handgun. There were no leads in the Walters case until February 1977, when the mother of the man convicted of Ward's murder made contact with Linda Blue, the lead homicide detective who was investigating the case. Convicted killer Edward Eugene Oliver had been spotted leaving the area where Ward's body had been found and was ultimately convicted of murdering him. Oliver made contact with Blue and claimed he wanted to talk about both murders.\n\nOn February 11, 1977, Oliver told Blue that he and John Errol Ferguson had carried out the murders of both Walters and Ward and that Ferguson was the shooter. According to Oliver; Ferguson, Walters, Ward, and himself had all been part of a gang that had robbed a Miami clothing store and a warehouse on Florida's west coast. Ward had then been tasked with selling the merchandise but had instead disappeared, apparently intending to keep the loot all for himself. In October 1974, Ferguson and Oliver tracked down Walters, who refused to talk. According to Oliver, Ferguson then killed him with a shotgun, before dumping his body near railroad tracks in Miami. The two men then found Ward on October 30, with Oliver claiming it was also Ferguson who shot and killed him. After the two dumped his body in Collier County, only Oliver was spotted leaving the area. He was arrested and charged with the murder of Ward. After the interview, Oliver was given a polygraph examination, which he passed. Additionally, clothing found in Walters' home linked him to the burglary at the Miami clothing store.\n\nFerguson was already in jail at the time of the revelation for an unrelated crime and was serving an eighteen-month sentence for resisting arrest. As he was due for parole in April, Blue wanted to hurry and charge Ferguson. He was brought to the Dade County Jail, however, the charges were never filed. After Blue sent the case to the state attorney's office, the assistant state attorney refused to file any charges, as according to him, Oliver's words were insufficient for prosecution, and he wanted more proof of Ferguson's involvement. Blue thought Oliver's testimony was sufficient grounds for charging Ferguson, however, Oliver also wanted immunity in exchange for his testimony, which the assistant state attorney would not offer. As no charges were filed, Ferguson was paroled in April 1977.\n\nIn May 1977, the bodies of 75-year-old Raymond Perry, and his wife, 82-year-old Katherine Perry, were found in their room at the Gold Dust Motel in Miami. The couple, who were from St. Petersburg, Florida, had been tied up, beaten, robbed, and shot to death execution-style. The gun used to kill them was a handgun.\n\nCarol City massacre\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, accompanied by Marvin Francois, Beauford White, and Adolphus Archie, drove to the home of 33-year-old Livingston Stocker; a Vietnam veteran and small-time marijuana dealer. Ferguson, who was posing as a Florida Power & Light Company worker, knocked on the door of Stocker's home, in Carol City, Florida. 24-year-old Margaret Wooden answered, and Ferguson gained access to the property. After checking several rooms, he drew a handgun, tied up Wooden, and then blindfolded her. He then opened the front door to let Francois and White inside, while Archie waited outside in the car as a getaway driver. All the men wore masks and were armed with guns. The men ransacked and searched the property for drugs and money.\n\nApproximately two hours later, six of Wooden's friends, including Stocker, arrived at the house. The trio ambushed them, searched them, tied them up, and then blindfolded each of them. A short time later, another one of Stocker's friends, 24-year-old Michael Miller, entered the property and was also ambushed, bound, and searched. Miller and Wooden were placed in the bedroom and the other six were bound in the living room. After this, the mask Francois was wearing fell off and revealed his face. Ferguson then said they would have to kill everyone.\n\nFrancois shot all six people in the living room with a shotgun execution-style. He fatally shot Stocker, 35-year-old Henry Clayton, 26-year-old John Holmes, 37-year-old Gilbert Williams, and 35-year-old Charles Stinson. He also shot 45-year-old Johnnie Hall, who survived. Ferguson headed to the bedroom and shot both Wooden and Miller in the head with a handgun, also execution-style. Wooden had heard shots coming from the living room and witnessed a pillow come toward her head. She was then shot and witnessed Miller being fatally shot in the head. Although Wooden did not personally see the shooter, she did hear Ferguson run out of the room.\n\nWhile the shootings occurred, White remained by the front door with a gun to prevent anyone from entering or escaping the property. The gunmen then left. Wooden and Hall survived by turning their heads as the shootings occurred. Wooden eventually managed to get to her feet, escape the property, and run to a neighbor's house, where she called the police. When the police arrived, they found the six dead bodies, all of whom had been shot in the back of the head, and had their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nAccording to Archie, the killers drove to a motel room after the massacre and split the stolen money, which totaled around $800. In Archie's testimony, he claimed Francois bragged about the killings and compared them to the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre, while White was upset and looked like he had seen a ghost.\n\nOn September 1, 1977, police arrested Archie while questioning him at the Dade County Sheriff's Office. In the early hours of September 2, Francois was arrested at the Dade County Jail, where he was being held on unrelated shoplifting charges. White was arrested at the Ron Dini Motel later that day. Ferguson, however, remained at large.\n\nHialeah murders\nOn January 8, 1978, 17-year-old Brian Glenfeldt and 17-year-old Belinda Worley, a couple, left a Youth-for-Christ meeting in Hialeah. They were meant to meet up with friends at an ice cream parlor, however, they never showed up. Instead, the two had gone for ice cream at Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor, located at Hialeah's Westland Mall. They then left and parked at a field known as a popular lovers' lane. Ferguson then approached them, posing as a police officer, intending to rob the couple. He fatally shot Glenfeldt behind the wheel of his mother's car, before taking Worley into the nearby woods where he raped and murdered her.\n\nAt 2:00 a.m. the families of Glenfeldt and Worley filed missing person reports for both of them. The following morning, Worley's body was discovered under an Australian pine tree in a wooded area. A quarter-mile away, Glenfeldt's body was also located. He had a bullet in his head and was still slumped over behind the wheel of his mother's car. It was determined the shot to the head had killed him, but he had also been shot in the chest and arm. All of Worley's clothes, apart from her jeans, were next to her body. She had been killed by a shot to the back of the head. An autopsy later revealed that she had been raped. Jewelry had been stolen from her body and cash in Glenfeldt's wallet had also been taken.\n\nOn April 5, 1978, Ferguson was finally captured after the FBI received a tip that he was at an apartment. FBI agents arrived to take him into custody, but Ferguson refused to open the door. Afterward, the agents kicked it down and cornered Ferguson in the living room, where he was wielding a handgun and pointing it at the ceiling. He told them not to shoot him. Ferguson was then arrested and taken into custody.\n\nTrials\nFrancois was the first of the three killers to be convicted. On April 24, 1978, he was sentenced to death for his role in the Carol City massacre. The jury had recommended a death sentence.\n\nWhite's trial proved more controversial. His defense argued that he did not actually kill anyone and instead acted as a lookout by standing watch at the door of the property as the killings occurred. As such, the jury unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to life in prison. On April 27, 1978, the judge overrode the recommendation and sentenced White to death, partly citing his criminal record. In 1984, his death sentence was overturned by a Dade Circuit judge, who resentenced him to life in prison. On April 25, 1985, the Supreme Court of Florida reversed the decision and reinstated White's death sentence.\n\nFerguson was tried last. On May 25, 1978, he was sentenced to death for his role in the Carol city massacre. On October 7, 1978, he received a further two death sentences for the Hialeah murders. In 1982, the Supreme Court of Florida threw out the death sentence, saying that the judge failed to consider evidence of Ferguson's mental illness. However, a year later, he was resentenced to death. He was never charged in the 1974 murders of Walters and Ward, or the 1977 motel murders of Raymond and Katherine Perry. However, the handgun used in the Carol City massacre and the Hialeah murders was found to be the same handgun that had been used in the motel murders and the shooting of Walters.\n\nArchie pleaded guilty to six counts of second degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role as the getaway driver in the Carol City massacre. He was the state's key witness in the trials of Ferguson, Francois, and White. Archie has since been released from prison.\n\nExecutions\nOn May 29, 1985, Francois was executed in the electric chair. He was executed shortly after 7:00 a.m. and spent his final hours with his mother, girlfriend, and twin teenage children. His last meal consisted of shrimp, lobster tail, barbecued spare ribs, chicken breast, watermelon, strawberries, sliced tomatoes, and french fries. He refused the services of a clergyman.\n\nReading from a written last statement, Francois said \"The Miami institutionalized white racist judiciary and law enforcement systems have made me, the once heroin addict, the scapegoat, with fabricated assertions, dishonest policemen, unethical judges, unethical state attorneys, drug pushers, and drug users for their political and personal ambitions and their inability and unwillingness to control the drug sphere of Miami's communities as America made Grenada the scapegoat for their inability or unwillingness to control the blowing up of the American Embassy in Lebanon where many soldiers were killed. That is the plight of the black race at the hands of the white race, be it one black like me or many blacks as in South Africa. The state of Florida honors the drug merchants of the black community with my death as the white race honors King and Tutu with Nobel Peace Prizes for the death of the minds of the black race. I do not extend sympathy to me, for I am as a grain of sand on the beach of the black race. The black race has lost its pride and dignity and is slowly dying from within and without, and blind with seeing eyes. My death ends my tears and the fortune of watching my race slowly die. I am a black American, Ashanti Ankobia. I join my ancestors.\" After finishing his written statement, Francois said \"If there is such a thing as an Antichrist, it ain't one man but the whole white race.\"\n\nOn August 28, 1987, White was executed in the electric chair. He was pronounced dead at 7:11 a.m. at Florida State Prison. When asked if he had any last words, White said \"No, sir.\" He was originally scheduled to be executed in February 1984 but had been granted a reprieve.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, Ferguson was executed by lethal injection after spending thirty-five years on death row. He was pronounced dead at 6:17 p.m. and his last meal was a standard prison meal consisting of a meat patty with white bread, steamed tomatoes, potato salad, diced carrots, and iced tea. His execution was repeatedly delayed following years of appeals over his sanity, with his attorneys arguing that he was severely mentally ill and had succumbed to delusions and hallucinations, including a belief that he would rise up after his execution to fight alongside Jesus and save America from a communist plot. His final statement was \"I just want everyone to know that I am the Prince of God and I will rise again.\"\n\nSee also\n Capital punishment in Florida\n List of people executed in Florida\n List of people executed in the United States in 2013\n List of serial killers in the United States\n\nReferences\n\n1974 in Florida\n1974 murders in the United States\n1977 in Florida\n1977 murders in the United States\n1978 in Florida\n1978 murders in the United States\n20th-century American criminals\nDeaths by firearm in Florida\nJanuary 1978 events in the United States\nJuly 1977 events in the United States\nMass murder in Florida\nMassacres in 1978\nMassacres in the United States\nSerial killers from Florida\nSerial murders in the United States", "unikey": "Carol City murders", "summary": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978.

His final statement was \"I just want everyone to know that I am the Prince of God and I will rise again.\"\n", "", ""], "info_kv": {"Location": "Carol City, Florida, United States", "Date": "October 1974–January 1978", "Attack type": "Robbery, rape, murder, mass shooting", "Weapons": "Handgun, knife", "Deaths": "12", "Perpetrators": "John Errol FergusonMarvin FrancoisBeauford White"}, "reference": [["\"John Errol Ferguson #1343\".

fergusons prior incarceration on 071582 the fsc affirmed the convictions but vacated the death sentences and remanded to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing finding that the trial court

unconstitutionality of the death penalty failure to suppress evidence admission of evidence of the other murders and improper prosecutorial comments during closing arguments on 071582 the fsc affirmed

the petition was affirmed by the us court of appeals on 082609 id at 499 thus defendant was not a person under sentence of imprisonment the trial courts finding in aggravation that defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to many persons was improper in white v state 403 so2d 331 march 20 1981 we held that said aggravating circumstance was inapplicable with regard to defendants accomplice beauford white and for the reasons expressed therein we hold likewise in the case sub judice also improper was the finding as an aggravating circumstance that defendant was under a sentence of imprisonment at the time that he committed the crimes for which he was sentenced at the time of the murders defendant was serving a twoyear period of probation which followed an eighteenmonth period of incarceration he was not confined in prison at the time nor was he supposed to be in peek v state 395 so2d 492 fla1981 cert denied 451 us 964 101 sct 2036 68 led2d 384 1981 we held that persons who are under an order of probation and are not at the time of the commission of the capital offense incarcerated or escapees from incarceration do not fall within the phrase person under sentence of imprisonment as set forth in section 9211415a id at 499 thus defendant was not a person under sentence of imprisonment sanity to be executed due process conclusion vferguson v secretary for dept of corrections 580 f3d 1183 11th cir 2009 habeas 6 due process claim that evidentiary hearing was necessary in death penalty case so that substitute judge in resentencing proceeding could properly evaluate aggravation and mitigation factors was procedurally barred and i background a factual background 2 the hialeah murders b procedural background 1 trials and direct appeals 2 florida postconviction  habeas proceedings 3 federal habeas proceedings ii discussion a legal standards applicable to this appeal b ineffective assistance of counsel during penalty phase 1 the carol city trial the district court reached the same conclusion in the federal habeas proceedings it found that robbins had conducted some investigation into fergusons history of mental illness and based on that investigation made a reasonable tactical decision  to avoid potentially greater prejudice from damaging information that would have been introduced to the jury regarding background and made a reasonable tactical decision in light of this investigation to focus on creating lingering doubt about his guilt id it also determined that even if the investigation was unreasonable any failure in that regard would not undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings given the overwhelming aggravating factors involved the court therefore concluded that ferguson had not met the second prong of the strickland testfn8 fn11 the record in this case consists of the district court filings along with the various state court filings the majority of which were filed as exhibits to r253 the state court filings were subdivided into various letterdesignated appendices ranging from a to nn appendices a to jj are the briefs petitions and opinions from those various proceedings appendices kk and ll are the records from the direct appeal of the carol city and hialeah trials respectively appendix mm is the record from the resentencing and appendix nn the record from the state postconviction or 3850 proceedings within this opinion references to documents in r253 will refer to the appendix and page number ie app nn at 1000 because the pleadings and transcripts in appendices kk ll and mm are collected in separately paginated volumes references to documents in those appendices will also list the volume number ie app mm vol 1 at 4 2 the hialeah trial we find that the aggravating factors significantly outweighed any mitigating evidence including that which was not presented to the jury the facts of the hialeah murders are just as cruel and shocking as those of the carol city killings one of the victims worley suffered extreme physical abuse including being apparently raped prior to being shot in the head and left partially nude by the roadside the other victim glenfeld was shot twice both before and after worley had been sexually assaulted and murdered admittedly at least two jurors decided not to impose the death penalty even in the face of such circumstancesfn17 nevertheless the missing evidence likely would not have changed the outcome notably most of the evidence regarding fergusons medical background already had been presented during the guilt phase of the trial so the jury considered that evidence in sentencing him to death the missing evidence thus primarily involved fergusons family history although it is possible that evidence of fergusons mental history might have caused some jurors to recommend a sentence rather than death we do not find that this was reasonably probable given the wealth of aggravating circumstances see parker v secretary for the dept of corr 331 f3d 764 783  n 16 11th cir2003 noting that the proper standard of review is whether the jurys failure to hear the mitigating evidence undermines the confidence in its verdict thus demonstrating a reasonable probability of a different result rather than whether the result would have been different absent the deficient performance alterations quotation marks and citation omitted accordingly we find that ferguson has not met the prejudice prong and conclude that the district court correctly denied ferguson habeas relief with respect to his iac claim regarding the penalty phase of the hialeah trialfn18 c hitchcock error 1 the carol city trial ferguson contends that he was denied a fair sentencing at the trial because these instructions unconstitutionally precluded the jury from considering nonstatutory mitigating evidence in deciding whether to impose the death penalty in violation of hitchcock he asserts that any error from the courts earlier instructions was not cured by the judges later statement indicating that there was no limitation on the mitigating factors in addition ferguson notes that the prosecutor made comments during closing arguments that could be interpreted as supporting the notion that only statutory mitigating factors could be consideredfn20 both the state courts and district court rejected this claim in the 3850 proceedings the florida supreme court found that there had been no hitchcock error because the trial judges later instruction clearly informed the jurors that they were not limited to consideration of the statutory mitigating circumstances ferguson iv 593 so2d at 512 because it made this finding the court did not address the issue of harmless error on federal habeas review the district court determined that the florida supreme courts statements regarding whether the sentencing judge limited consideration to statutory mitigating factors constituted findings of fact since the record supported the florida supreme courts finding that there had not been such a limitation in the carol city trial the court denied fergusons claim neither the florida supreme nor the federal district court addressed the issue of harmless errorfn21 as a preliminary note we cannot consider as part of our harmless error analysis any mitigating evidence that robbins failed to produce in performing the harmless error analysis for a hitchcock claim we must consider both the mitigating evidence presented at sentencing as well as mitigating evidence that could have been presented but which the state trial court prevented the petitioner from presenting smith 61 f3d at 817 quotation marks and citation omitted in other words must consider all potential mitigating evidence that would have been presented but for the hitchcock error id in this case there is no indication that the trial court inhibited fergusons ability to present the missing mitigating evidence and ferguson identifies no case law supporting the notion that a harmless error analysis for a hitchcock claim should examine such evidence fn23 2 the hialeah trial d brady claim even though breedlove i is not controlling ferguson has failed to provide a rationale for us to reach a different conclusion with respect to materiality the purported connections between fergusons offenses and the detectives crimes are too attenuated to meet the materiality test the criminal scheme in which the detectives took part included a range of drugrelated felonies not seen in the carol city murders ie racketeering possession of various drugs with the intent to distribute money counterfeiting and tax evasion see alonso 740 f2d at 865 n 1 additionally the conspirators used a falsified police warrant to gain entry to the home a modus operandi distinct from and likely unavailable to ferguson and his compatriots during the carol city murders see id at 866 the detectives also may not have been aware of the investigations at the time of fergusons trials and thus would not have had a reason to implicate ferguson for their crimes see breedlove v state 580 so2d 605 607 fla1991  breedlove ii per curiam if as ferguson asserts the detectives were motivated by a desire to implicate others for their crimes he has not identified particular facts to indicate why the detectives would have had a reason to present false testimony in his specific case reed 875 so2d at 431 since florida courts would have treated such evidence as inadmissible it is immaterial for brady purposes we therefore find that ferguson has not stated a valid brady claim and that the district court thus properly denied ferguson habeas relief for this claimfn33 e failure to correct false testimony as a preliminary matter there may have been no giglio violation here because the prosecutor arguably corrected the false testimony by entering into evidence fergusons correct conviction record which included a reference to the not guilty verdict however no party called attention to the discrepancy in any event assuming there was a violation fergusons claim would be procedurally barred the motion to supplement was filed twelve years after the completion of trial and a month after the court denied fergusons 3850 motion fergusons counsel contends that neither they nor any of his prior counsel had knowledge of the incorrectness of hartmanns testimony until july 1990 when they discovered documents indicating a contrary set of events even if we accept these facts and there are reasons to doubt themfn35 ferguson has not explained why his attorneys could not have obtained evidence of the discrepancy at an earlier date in light of the extreme time gap between trial and the filing of the motion to supplement along with the fact that evidence of the factual discrepancy was in the trial record we find that ferguson has not shown that he meets the due diligence requirement for the exception to rule 3850s time bar we therefore conclude that fergusons giglio claim is procedurally barredfn36 f jury separation claim g resentencing by a new judge h racebased peremptory challenges i ex parte contacts during postconviction proceedings fn45 in particular judge snyder stated to the state attorney i am not worried about mr prettyman doesnt like it thats okay i never worry about ex parte because i dont ex parte anybody if there is anything that ever has to be done mr prettyman youll be notified immediately but i am not going to let that stand in the way to have an entire hearing and bring a lawyer in from washington and we still havent accomplished anything app nn at 103031 in this case fergusons counsel was aware of the ex parte contacts as early as january 1988 yet failed to file the motion seeking disqualification until more than a year later furthermore in that motion he admitted that he decided to file the motion only after suffering an adverse ruling on the motion to stay accordingly the motion would be untimely under florida law unless ferguson can show good cause for the delay in filing see fischer 497 so2d at 243 ferguson asserts that this delay was acceptable because his counsel detected judge snyders potential bias only when that ruling came out however this contention is belied by the fact that his counsel had objected on multiple prior occasions to the ex parte contacts but did not file a motion in those instances in light of this background the decision to wait until after the adverse ruling appears to be the kind of delaying tactic that florida courts have frowned uponfn51 see id at 242 noting that a recusal motion was designed to frustrate the process by which petitioner suffered an adverse ruling see also marcotte v gloeckner 679 so2d 1225 1226 fladistctapp1996 per curiam deeming timely a recusal motion filed after an adverse ruling where the underlying facts were discovered only after that ruling given this precedent there is no indication that the circuit court arbitrarily applied the procedural bar see judd 250 f3d at 1313 since ferguson has not alleged cause or prejudice for the procedural default other than the contention that the procedural rule was not regularly followed nor does there appear to be any fundamental miscarriage of justice we cannot hear the claim see zeigler 345 f3d at 1304 the district court thus correctly denied fergusons habeas claim with respect to this issuefn52 j issues relating to fergusons competency 1 competency to proceed with 3850 postconviction claim 2 competency to proceed with federal

respondentappellee appeal from the united states district court for the southern district of florida before vance henderson and clark circuit judges by the court before the court are appellants motions for certificate of probable cause for stay of execution pending appeal and for oral argument we deny the certificate of probable cause we deny the motion for oral argument the briefs have been excellent and the court finds that oral argument is unnecessary the court denies the motion to stay the execution beyond the 24 hours already granted the enmund issue does not give rise to a conclusion of constitutional violation francois v wainwright no 851918  f supp  sd fla 52585 it is true that in this case trial counsel did put several family members on the stand and asked them a few questions regarding whether they believed francois could be rehabilitated and whether he had a violent personality see francois v wainwright 741 f2d 1275 1285 n 10 11th cir 1984 however this was also true in hitchcock the panel majority in hitchcock stated petitioner argues that greater details as to his upbringing in an environment of extreme poverty his solid character traits devotion to hard work willingness to contribute to the familys support and respect for adults should have been presented as evidence of nonstatutory mitigating factors all of this was developed however to some extent for the jury 745 f2d at 1338 emphasis added despite the surface similarity of hitchcock we conclude that a stay should not be granted it is our opinion that the proffered evidence of nonstatutory mitigating evidence would not have affected the sentencing outcome in this case had it been submitted to the jury4 our review of the evidence convinces us that the jury found that francois shot six persons intending to kill them to eliminate them as witnesses to a robbery five died the survivor identified francois from a police lineup at which francois counsel was present the proffered evidence shows that francois was the product of a sordid and impoverished childhood environment his parents were not married his father was a habitual heroin addict who never worked who brought other addicts into the home for the ingestion of heroin in front of francois when a child and who beat francois because he would not fight with other children when he was a boy francois mother often worked as a prostitute and was of little benefit to francois during his childhood she married but francois stepfather abused him francois grew up as a child of the street at the same time he was smart and although not finishing school he obtained his ged the behavioral scientists in their affidavits posit that  some offenders like marvin francois are themselves victims of circumstances that shape their lives in ways beyond their deliberate control they suggest that given francois chaotic antisocial upbringing clear mitigation of punishment compellingly surfaces at the time of the crime francois was 31 years of age he had been convicted of two felonies involving violence we conclude that granting a stay would serve no justiciable purpose we can conceive of death penalty cases where the nonstatutory mitigating evidence proffered here might affect the sentencing outcome this is not one of those cases we conclude that the appellant has no chance of changing the outcome of the five death sentences in this case even if he prevailed on appeal and received a new sentencing hearing 1 in proffitt v florida 428 us 242 96 s ct 2960 49 l ed 2d 913 1976 the supreme court upheld the statute as facially valid the court however suggested that the mitigating circumstances provision of the statute might be open ended 428 us at 250 n 8 96 s ct at 2965 n 8 2 the court went on to say in any event the legislature chose to list the mitigating circumstances which it judges to be reliable for determining the appropriateness of a death penalty  and we are not free to expand the list 336 so2d at 1139 3 panels of this circuit as well as various opinions by justices of the supreme court have recognized the effect lockett had on the florida statute see eg ford v strickland 696 f2d 804 812 11th cir 1983 en banc foster v strickland 707 f2d 1339 11th cir 1983 en banc spaziano v florida  us   n 4 104 s ct 3154 3158 n 4 82 l ed 2d 340 347 n 4 1984 the florida supreme court has itself recognized that cooper could have been misconstrued by trial courts to limit the consideration of mitigating factors see eg perry v state 395 so 2d 170 fla1981 4 the state trial court instructed the jury as follows with respect to mitigating evidence the aggravating circumstances which you may consider are limited to those upon which i have just instructed you however there is no such limitation
