{"id": 73392240, "key": "Port of Whitby", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port%20of%20Whitby", "text": "The Port of Whitby is an ancient and historic seaport on the North Yorkshire coast of England. The port lies at the mouth of the River Esk, where it enters into the North Sea. A port has been in existence at Whitby since at least the 7th century, when it was used to bring in supplies for Whitby Abbey. The port is famous for being the port of origin for the sailings of Captain Cook, and some of the ships that he sailed on were also built in the harbour.\n\nCommercial cargo ceased in the late 20th century, however, the port is still an important location for the landing of fish.\n\nHistory \nNo records exist of actual dates when the port started, but fish were being landed at Whitby during the time that the first abbey had been built in 657. It is thought that the port was in what is now the upper harbour (south of the swing bridge, as coastal erosion had not yet subjected the lower harbour cliff walls to collapse, making that side of the estuary too steep to house piers). William de Percy granted the port to the abbey at Whitby, a grant which was confirmed by William II sometime before 1096. In 1122, a dispute was recorded in the collection of tithes from fishermen due to the abbot, which also noted that coal was imported into Whitby.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the ports of England were administered by the Exchequer, who divided the ports into the main ports, with lesser ports on the coast near to them being labelled as creco or creek ports. Whitby was a creek port of Newcastle with a reach to what is Spital Bridge in the town, but the authority of the port later reached upstream to the tidal limit of Ruswarp.\n\nThe port was never equal to other ports in the area such as Hull or Middlesbrough. This is due to the hinterland that surrounded the port, with Whitby being largely cut-off from overland travel until the 18th and 19th centuries, it had no great industries to export or import for, being surrounded on all sides of the river by moorland (except for the coast to the north). Trade through the port accelerated with the coming of the railways, but its main function was either as a shelter for ships from storms in the North Sea, or as a re-supply point. Between 1702 and 1704, the number of collier ships alone totalled 98, Bridlington, Hull and Scarborough only hosted 48, 28 and 54 respectively. The safe haven almost guaranteed at Whitby (and at Scarborough and Bridlington too), allowed the port to charge a levy towards the upkeep of the harbour and piers. The levy also applied to passing trade of coal from many north-eastern locations, with the levy not being rescinded until 1861.\n\nDuring the era of timber shipbuilding (mid 16th–late 19th centuries), vessels would arrive from the St. Lawrence Rivercarrying timber, masts and bowsprits. These vessels were too large to enter the harbour, and would unload their cargo onto smaller ships in the Whitby Roads. The smaller craft would then enter the harbour to unload the delivery on the dockside. Another method of offloading goods from the ship without actually entering Whitby harbour was to beach the vessel on the sand. This was a common practice for delivering coal to places such as Sandsend, and for which, the Whitby Cats (a flat-bottomed boat), was specifically designed for.\n\nA survey in the 1950s determined that the port at Whitby was not as successful as other neighbouring cargo ports such as Hull, Teesside and West Hartlepool, on account of its lack of urban sprawl, and the absence of warehouses on the dock side with which to store goods in a safe manner before onward export, or inward transportation. It also suffered a loss of traffic due to the depth of the water in the harbour; as the sailing ships gave way to first paddle steamers, and then steel boats of even bigger sizes, the newer ships could not negotiate into the harbour.\n\nWhitby's port was divided into two main sections; the upper harbour south of the swing bridge, and the lower harbour, north of the swing bridge. The lower harbour has been the location of the fish markets during the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1956, a new fish quay was built adjacent to Pier Road on the west bank of the River Esk. Dredging along the lower harbour had damaged the previous fish quay which had been built in 1914. The fish market in Whitby port increased after the railways arrived in the town as this allowed fresh fish to be dispatched across the country at a faster pace than delivered by boat.\n\nPart of the upper harbour area was converted into a marina between 2008 and 2010.\n\n21st century port \nThe maximum DWT in the port is , with a length of , a beam of  and a draught of . However, cargo trade, except for fish-landing, ceased in the year 2000.\n\nCommodities \nHistorically, the port was known for its involvement in the export of alum, and the importing of timber, nominally for building ships. Timber, flax and hemp were imported from the Baltic states during the 18th and 19th centuries, but this was to further the shipbuilding, and during the winter months even more importantly, the ship repairing trade due to Whitby's location as a safe port. However, its most lasting and notable trade has been in the landing of fish and the whale industry. In the 17th century, herring were being exported to Scotland, and the associated herring industry required the import of salt.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the record books begin to show more and more trade within the port due to the accelerated demand of the alum industry. Coal is shown as increasing rapidly, though peat burning was still being used in domestic capacities, so the increase in coal volumes is tied to the alum-making. A storehouse for coal was built near Haggersgate, a road in the town on the west bank of the harbour where the new fish quay is. Also imported were malt, rye and wine. Exports were finished alum, the bark stripped from timber being used for shipbuilding, and sailcloth. One of the oddest commodities imported into the harbour was human urine. The alum industry required ammonia as part of its process, and the easiest source of this at the time was human urine. Whilst some came in from local areas, it was brought in from as far afield as Newcastle and London.\n\nIn 1675, the port was handling alum, ham, butter, salt and fish. Several alum works existed in the area around Whitby, and so the port offered a natural point of offloading. This in turn generated export of alum, and the import of timber, so that Whitby could build its own ships to transport the goods needed, and export the finished alum itself. The landing of whales at Whitby flourished between 1753 and 1835, concentrated on the Northern Whale Fishery around Greenland. No attempt was made by Whitby boats to try whaling in Antarctica , the favoured region by whalers sailing from Hull and London. However, the whaling industry in Whitby was described as a \"losing concern\" in a government report of 1833 as oil was available from other sources. Between 1753 and 1835, a total of 2,687 whale carcasses were brought back to the port, an average of 32 per year. The rendering of whale blubber was undertaken further upriver than the port, around the area where Larpool Viaduct now stands. The waste from the blubber to oil process, known locally as Fenks, was exported from the port as a manure.\n\nA sample of imports and exports from 1790 shows that imports consisted of fruit, wine, spices and other foods, but most critically, the greatest tonnage came in the form of oars, anchors, pitch, oakum, timber, hemp, rope, cordage, linen and hessian canvas, all of which were essential to the shipbuilding industry. The balance in the exports was a less comprehensive list but included wines, tar, alum, bacon, ham, butter, oats, ale, whale products and dried fish. Again, items associated with the shipbuilding industry are present, but the most interesting export was sleepers and pit props, of which nearly 17,000 were dispatched by ship. \n\nIn the 19th century, coal which was formerly offloaded at Whitby, started to arrive in the town via the railway. As most collieries were connected to the railway, and the loading charges for taking wagons over the railway had already been paid by the colliery, having to then trans-ship the coal to a boat to deliver within the UK was uneconomically viable at that time. Iron ore and iron products were exported through Whitby by the South Cleveland Iron Works, who had a smelter at Grosmont, some  south of Whitby accessible by the Whitby & Pickering Railway. Smaller iron ore concerns also used the port, with most being transferred to either Teesside or Tyneside by ship, but this was short-lived in the face of the increasing railway network and the quick exhaustion of iron ore seams in the area. Buoyed by the arrival of the railways, minerals were exported through the port, and local sandstone from Aislaby was sent to London to build London Bridge and the Houses of Parliament. \n\nWhilst ferries are not known to have operated from Whitby, shipping did take passengers in the form of convicts transported to Australia and emigrants to Canada, usually to St Lawrence in the 1820s and 1830s.\n\nOwners \nWhitby Harbour Commissioners (1702–1906)\nWhitby Urban District Council (1906–1974)\nScarborough Borough Council (1974–2023)\nNorth Yorkshire Council (2023–)\n\nSee also \nShip and boat building in Whitby\nPiers of Whitby\nEskdale Anticline\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\nWhitby\nWhitby\nWhaling in the United Kingdom", "unikey": "Port of Whitby", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["History", "21st_century_port", "Commodities", "Owners", "See_also", "Notes", "References"], "contents": ["No records exist of actual dates when the port started, but fish were being landed at Whitby during the time that the firstabbeyhad been built in 657.It is thought that the port was in what is now the upper harbour (south of theswing bridge, as coastal erosion had not yet subjected the lower harbour cliff walls to collapse, making that side of the estuary too steep to house piers).William de Percygranted the port to the abbey at Whitby, a grant which was confirmed byWilliam IIsometime before 1096.In 1122, a dispute was recorded in the collection of tithes from fishermen due to the abbot, which also noted that coal was imported into Whitby.\nDuring theMiddle Agesand into the 18th century, the ports of England were administered by theExchequer, who divided the ports into the main ports, with lesser ports on the coast near to them being labelled ascrecoorcreek ports.

vulnerability many of the features associated with the alum coal jet ironstone shipbuilding industries will be particular to this stretch of coast and therefore nationally rare some of the historic structures are protected as listed buildings recommendations sustainable uses should be found for any surviving structures reuse should incorporate as much of extant structures as possible abandoned

near port or harbour areas is complicated and often archaic  some of the legislation dates back two centuries or more defra march 2007 59 it recommends that wherever possible a straightforward and consistent system of regulation applies in future antiquated rules and complicated provisions are particularly prevalent in local harbour acts and it is important that local navigational provisions should meet modern regulatory standards ibid out of date local rules need to be modernised to also include operations outside harbour areas as well as works within them where they are all part of the port infrastructure or operations this will reduce the overlap of harbours and environmental legislation and the duplication of licensingwhere local powers to control the environmental or navigational

held responsible for failure to maintain an adequate service the discharge of such functions by a cha even if it concludes that no pilotage is needed in its area involves a level of responsibility on

in december 2018 the secretary of state received an application from the chief executive of the council requesting the removal of its status as a cha for the harbours of scarborough and whitby and filey coble landing as the only facilities which the council manages given that pilotage services have never been offered at filey coble landing this consultation will concentrate on the harbours or whitby and scarborough the application notes that following careful consideration and a recent comprehensive review the council has concluded that pilotage  which is currently mandatory for vessels greater than 37 metres in length  is no longer required to ensure the safe navigation of the types of the craft that now use its facilities and that there is no prospect of that situation changing the

the rock created scenes that might have come from a medieval artists depiction of hell with 60ft pyres smouldering for nine months at a stretch the trade reeked not just of smoke but of stale urine which was the readiest source of the ammonia needed for the complex chemical process bizarrely human waste became a valuable commodity and barrels to collect it were left in every village for miles around with residents encouraged to support the industry which was a major employer by passing water for the common good advertisementhide adadvertisementhide addespite their best efforts they just couldnt produce enough so a public toilet was opened in hull neither for convenience nor hygiene but as a collection point there still wasnt enough and so buckets appeared on street corners in the poorest areas of london and newcastle the alum trade was a pioneer of reverse snobbery being of the opinion that the poor produced a better class of urine purer because it was less likely to be tainted by alcohol which they couldnt afford they dutifully gave of their best and it was collected weekly in barrels for shipping to yorkshire the industry went into decline in the 1850s as new dyes were developedthe clifftop path tells the story of the alum industry but so do its remains the peak alum works at ravenscar are the most complete a production line laid out like any modern industrial complex but there is another legacy of this strange and stinking industry that jeer of derision heard daily around the country originally aimed at the workmen who had the lousy job of collecting

with townparish councils cllr greg white whitby is now under a 2tier system of councils since 1st april 2023 north yorkshire council nyc is comprised of 6 area committees one of these is the scarborough and whitby area committee whitby additionally has its own town council and the surrounding 16 parishes have parish councilsprevious to this whitby was under a 3tier system of councils since 1974 north yorkshire county council nycc was comprised of 7 boroughs one of which was scarborough borough council sbc which was responsible for an area on the east coast from filey in the south and beyond whitby in the north under this system local residents considered that decisions were made far from whitby and district affecting the lives of local people without sufficient real consultation or consideration for the needs of residents and typically prioritising the visitor to the area north yorkshire council nyc has a declared aim of being built with local at its heart and aims to be the most local large council in the country the implication of this is that local communities will be at the heart of the decision making process being better able to shape their own communities rather than having them dictated from northallerton area committees nyc has whitby placed in an area committee with scarborough with filey being part of an area committee with thirsk and malton shown below this was not subject to any discussion just imposed so that it aligns for the convenience of the member of parliament the fact is that there is no legal basis for requiring alignment with parliamentary boundaries this scarborough and whitby area committee has either met remotely online or in scarborough since its inception in 2021 to date  up to june 2023 with no live streaming of meetings effectively meaning that should any whitby district resident want to ask a question and be guaranteed that the question will be answered they would have to travel 20 miles just for thatthere is a significant swell of opinion that whitby has been unfairly disadvantaged over more than 40 years by being in a group with scarborough losing out on funding and being subject to prioritisation coming from scarborough against the wishes of the whitby residents a couple of examplesthe east pier extension connecting bridge took 20 years to be replaced and only with significant funding from whitby town councilwith cycling infrastructure scarborough gained a local cycling walking infrastructure plan along with many other north yorkshire towns some smaller than whitby yet whitby by being in a borough with scarborough ended up with nothing and subsequently still has next to no cycling infrastructureit will come down to how these area committee groups are defined in terms of their powers and what processes they operate to as to whether whitby councillors will be outvoted continually and the town continue to be disadvantaged the fact is that the residents of this town have made it clear they will not tolerate it furtherregarding how the area committee operates we need to mention that the scarborough and whitby area constituency committee almost always met in scarborough it also doesnt seem to stream its proceedings over the internet for whitby residents to have access how this provides anything like an opportunity to participate in the democratic process we are not sure it certainly does not serve the people of this districtwe contacted cllr david chance about this in march 2023 and he replied that he had asked nyc officers to find a venue in whitby and consider alternating the meetings this was subsequently passed as a motion for that committee and the first meeting in whitby for 5 years took place on 22nd sept 2023 thanks to cllr chance for addressing this problemfor the record here are the dates and venues of the meetings of this committee since 2018 2018  20 jun scarborough 26 sep whitby 12 dec scarborough2019  20 mar scarborough 19

more meetings happen poll  same area committee as scarborough in june 2022 how the new council would operate was still open to discussion and we felt  as underlined in the history of the area that whitby had been unfairly disadvantaged over more than 40 years by being in a group with scarborough and the executive of sbc with facilities being provided to scarborough as the normal course of action the visitor being targeted over the resident and whitby subsequently missing out on funding for facilities that would have benefitted the local population this cannot be allowed to continue with a unitary authority on 13th june 2022 whitby parish convened a poll including the question do you want to stay in the same area committee as scarborough in the new north yorkshire unitary councilnote that the leadership of the north yorkshire unitary council said previously that they will listen to what the people want to happen with this new authoritythis poll resulted in 887 of votes being cast against whitby remaining in the same area committee as scarborough change is needed and we wait for the north yorkshire council to respond to this request for action though havent yet seen anything to think that they will nyc area committees  more of the same an opinion piece by joyce stangoe  the views expressed are those of the authorthe biggest change to local government in north yorkshire since 1974 is about to take place the elections on the 5th of may 2022 has selected the councillors who will serve on the new north yorkshire unitary council once it comes into full effect from april 2023this single council will replace the present eight district borough and county councils the nycc document a unitary council for north yorkshire the case for change  final business case december 2020 promised thatwe are committed to seizing the significant opportunities available to us through a single unitary authority and we will deliver a transformative agenda for the benefit of our local people infrastructure and economyafter watching the nyccsbc virtual roadshow i have to ask if they are really seizing the opportunity or have they simply missed the boat the new authority intends to establish six area committees based on parliamentary constituencies this means that whitby will stay in the same area committee as scarborough whilst filey and hunmanby will come under the thirsk  ryedale area committee the whitby area will have 4 councillors and scarborough will have 11 councillorsthese area committees will have devolved responsibility from the unitary council for the discharge of statutory functions and services at the local level including planning licensing public rights of way highways and potentially other areas will this really deliver a transformative agenda for the benefit of our local people infrastructure and economyas their submission to the government claimed so proudly north yorkshire is unique in having two national parks and three areas of outstanding natural beauty ninety eight percent of the county is either sparsely 13 or supersparsely 85 populated with just over a third of the population living in these areasit is generally more expensive to deliver services to sparsely and supersparsely populated rural communities their residents often experience physical and digital isolation with difficulty in accessing services jobs transport links and education whitby is one of only 6 towns in england classed as an urban settlement set in a sparselypopulated rural areathe nycc locality profiles 201516 identified that those communities living within or on the fringes of the national parks such as whitby share a distinctive demographic profile plus significant geographic and environmental constraints the needs of such communities differ substantially from those living in less isolated towns and villages with much easier access to the a1 a19 a64 corridors  main rail routes or from the selby area with its good transport links and proximity to the city of york do the proposed area constituency committees really offer the best option has the new unitary considered creatingarea committees that focus on the national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty together with their service towns such a structure would highlight and support the new authoritys environmental credentials and their ambition to become the first carbonnegative regionthe existing national park authorities have wellestablished environmental protection and improvement programmes significant planning expertise and a good network of parish forums and local contacts whitby is one of the service towns serving the north york moors national park and it is surrounded by the national park would it not make more sense for whitby to be included in a more rural area committee rather than one serving a much larger town like scarborough simply because it has shared the same mp for the last 30 years parliamentary boundaries can and do change they are reviewed every five years surely the new area committees should group together those communities with common geographic and demographic characteristics which have a major effect on the local communitys access to the services provided by the unitary authority such as education transport health and social care etc these services are far more relevant to residents daily lives than whether or not they happen to share the same mpthe 2023 local government reorganisation could offer significant opportunities but the hopedfor transformation will not happen if whitby  district is still subordinate to scarborough as it was before planning authority for whitby and district the scarborough and whitby area constituency planning committee rules over planning issues for whitby sleights and sandsend being outside the north york moors national park nymnp and the nymnp rules over all other planning issues for whitby and districtthere has been discussion over many years about whitby sleights and sandsend becoming part of the national park being the only settlement totally enclosed by a national park in the uk see this document from whitby town council in 2010 for exampleregarding a possible change of national park boundary the natural england guidance includes marine boundaries in coastal areas where a marine boundary is to be drawn the boundary should follow the mean low water mark or the county boundary in the case of estuaries community networks the formation of nyc states there willbe newpowers and money for local people across communities market towns andparishes to drivelocal change local enterprise and local solutions and that local priorities willbe decided by around 30 community networks initially based around market town areas but how many and where they cover will be decided in consultation with local communities it is in part from this that whitby community network started by establishing our own community network in advance to take advantage of this purported greater power on 30th may 2023 nyc approved the community network concept but called it community partnerships and their proposal has nyc councillors taking a leading role in shaping the community partnership ie picking who is on it with no provided funding and claiming it is independent clearly the idea of nyc councillors taking a role in shaping these groups will negate any independency claim with little ability to hold nyc to account when handpicked individuals  groups and as such be completely unsatisfactory from our perspective maybe the formation of whitby town deal team is effectively the model they are basing this off where they had a team of 23 people only 2 or 3 of which were actual residents in the town and who never reported back to anyone in the town about what it was doing the fact that there is no operational funding means these groups have to magically do things voluntarily and apply for their own funds so much for the new money in the above statement then so maybe some other group in the hierarchy gets the money where the new power is exactly we arent sure either is this parishes taking charge of devolved assets and nothing to do with community networks anyway the concept is a dead duck as currently defined we have to hope that is not what was intended nor how it remains assets nyc took over all assets of nycc as well as those of sbc in april 2023 we have compiled these into a spreadsheet aug 2023 this contains some listed as community asset typically open spaces car parks some houses as well as depots and tourist facilities town  parish councils each parish council has a town  parish council to manage limited local assets  services town  parish councillors are not generally paid whitby parish has whitby town council wtc and has full council meetings every 2 months as well as individual committees for specific areas every 13 months a similar situation applies to other parish councils around the district though they do not have individual committees and their meeting tends to be once per monthwhilst all parish councils in the district are bound by the same set of overriding rules as wtc they may interpret those rules more flexibly the majority of parishes do have websites though some do not and some are much more fastidious in updating their information for residents more promptly than wtc are whitby town council specific to wtc agendas for meetings are put here typically 35 days before the meeting whilst members of the public can attend these meetings they have a limited role to play wtc manages most local toilets via a contractor a few of the smaller allotments christmas lights and christmas market and little more amongst the problems that have been raised by local electors about the way wtc is currently runmeeting atmosphere  the atmosphere for members of the public is not what one would call friendly saying people are welcome is one thing but more is needed for that to come across as welcoming and encouraging participation there is little advertisement of an upcoming meeting to encourage participation some councillors have their back to the public this could be easily remedied if they used a horseshoe table arrangement as used by several local parishes and the meeting room is unsuitable from an acoustic perspectivepublic interaction in meetings  members of the public can only speak at the start of the meeting up to 5 people for a maximum of 3 minutes each members of the public cannot ask questions later on during a debate of an issue or even contribute to the debate unless standing orders are suspended if a member of the public is better informed about a subject than councillors and cannot contribute how is the council going to reach an optimal conclusionminutes  meeting minutes only ever seem to get published on their website just before the next meeting of that type and only ever in with the agenda go figure why it doesnt make the minutes section of the website for several months sometimes as much as a year this can be nearly 2 months after the meeting in question this presents a significant barrier to local democracy since if a resident could not make a meeting they have to wait til just prior to the next one to see what happened and by then it is too late to get something added to that agenda draft minutes of meetings need putting on the website within say 5 working days of a meeting and at worst case 10 working days  the public pay for this servicenot voted in  the majority of whitby town councillors have never been elected via a contested vote abbey ward had an election in 2011 west cliff ward had elections in 20152016 and stakesby ward in 2012 it was proposed at a town assembly in 2023 that the number of councillors be reduced to something like 12 which would facilitate more chance of a public vote but this has not yet happened presumably awaiting a governance review by nyc to quote cllr carl les nyc it would be healthier if more parish and town councillors making significant financial decisions on behalf of taxpayers had a democratic mandatecommittees  members of committees are chosen based on popularity not experience in the particular aspect of the committee as an example as of august 2023 93 of council committee places were taken up by just 58 of councillors with 8 councillors having 1 or fewer committee role and just 5 councillors having more than 50 of the committee places the fact that a move to correct this deficiency was voted against in august 2023 says much about the dysfunctionalitynumber of committees  there are way too many committees and committees impose a significant load on clerking resources a first step would be to remove all subcommittees a solution would be to reduce committees down to a minimum and with it change the full council to meet once per month which would free up clerking time to better provide services this would follow the path that malton tc takes the council that is the only gold rated council in north yorkshirecommunication  communication with the public is amiss an example of lack of communication is that it does not announce changes to its precept to the public along with a clear statement of why it is needed and what is being provided for that a lack of respect for the people it is supposedly representing its social media accounts and website could be put to much greater use to keep the public informed of events or topical issues reported to it and that would have the added benefit that people would have greater regard for their town councilwe have made several proposals to whitby town council with a view to remedying some of these shortcomings all have been ignored and instead the current practices continue for the record our proposals have beenthat whitby town council meeting minutes record all actions agreed and that agendas of meetings have a section for all currently open actions from all previous minutes where such actions can be discussed as necessary and closed when considered complete if an action is still open after the subsequent meeting then it should be carried forward to the subsequent meeting until such a time that it is decided that it is either closed or no longer requiredthat whitby town council adopts a policy of informing their residents of any change to precept and the reason for the change by way of a post in the news section of the wtc website as well as to the wtc social media accountsthat whitby town council adopts a policy of publishing minutes of meetings within 5 working days of the meeting so that residents involved in local democracy the town mayor for 20232024 had a casting vote and voted against this in a council meeting we consider this contrary to

town council we simply look at the precept being levied on whitby residents all figures are from approved budgets history here is a potted history of the significant democracyrelated events affecting the whitby areawhitby urban district council wudc was formed in 1894 and first met in jan 1895the wudc act of1905 was a private bill they then put through parliament to allow them to take over the running of the harbour from the port  harbour trustees who owned the piers quays harbour walls etc the act also allowed them to purchase the bed of the river and harbour from the lord of manor as far as to ruswarp road bridgefrom 1905 to 1974 wudc was the local government authority for the town of whitby with some wider functions such as highways being provided by nyccthe 1968 maud report on local government reorganisation had proposed that the whitby area be included in the tees valley functional economic area and thus cease to be part of north yorkshire after much local controversy and resistance the whitby rural and urban districts instead became part of sbc in 1974 it remained part of the whitby  cleveland parliamentary constituency until 1992 when it was moved into the scarborough  whitby constituencyafter 1974 sbc operated through a committee structure which allowed local councillors from the whitby area to participate fully in decisions taken which affected their local area for example in 1985 local whitby councillors defeated property development plans for the upper harbour area of whitby by securing a resolution at sbc full council that in any development of the upper harbour the land reclaimed from the harbour shall be used for marine purposes only further land reclamation was to be reserved for use as a yachting marina and servicesin may 1997 the australianbuilt replica of captain cooks whitbybuilt ship hms endeavour sailed into her home port the resultant national and international media coverage transformed whitbys economic fortunes it became a leading tourism destination sbc estimated that there were 45 million visitors to whitby during the endeavour stay in may 1997 the replica endeavour made four repeat visits to whitby before returning to australia in 2004following the visit in 1998 sbc brought forward proposals to redevelop the remaining upper harbour  marina land the waterfront development project would add further pontoons provide better onshore facilities for marina users and regenerate the area by allowing commercial property development of the remaining land for residential hotel and retail useslocal residents again objected most strongly a town poll was eventually called on the issue in may 2000 the turnout was higher than for a general election and showed that 86 of voters opposed any commercial development on the upper harbour site the land was to be used for marine purposes onlyin response sbc commissioned consultants to hold a community planning weekend several years of dispute ensued but a town meeting held in 2004 voted 4001 against the revised plans sbcs preferred commercial development partner withdrew from the scheme and sbc finally conceded that the proposed development would have required a harbour revision order under the harbours act 1964 the sbc chief executive acknowledged that given the level of local opposition such an application was unlikely to be successful after several further iterations and an appeal to the local government ombudsman the new marina services building finally opened in june 2010 the upper harbour land was developed for marine purposes only in accordance with the sbc council resolution of 4 march 1985the remaining reclaimed land in the upper harbour was used for car parking those car parks became a major revenueearner for sbc since the number of visitors to whitby has continued to increase steadily throughout the decades following the kickstart provided by the visit of the replica hms endeavour objections to sbcs financial treatment of the income from the land in whitby harbour have resulted in sbcs annual accounts not having been signed off by the external auditor since the 2014  2015 financial year that issue is due to come to court shortly for the court to decide what is actually harbour land how can a council be responsible for a town from 1974 and not actually know what is harbour landfrom 2001 sbc implemented executive governance by a cabinet comprising eight portfolio holders to replace the committee structure which had allowed much wider participation in sbc decisionmaking about local areas by local councillorsanother town poll was called in 2009 and again in 2010 to answer the question would the people of whitby like to be part of a local authority independent of scarborough borough council but given very limited publicity plus the fact that no polling cards were issued and no postal votes were allowed the turnout was too low to carry the overwhelmingly clear message of the town poll held in 2000continued dissatisfaction resulted in whitby town council and filey town council passing votes of no confidence in sbc in dec 2017 since scarborough town is unparished thousands of its residents instead signed an online vote of no confidence in its administrationlocal electors in whitby again called for a town poll at the annual town assembly in 2018 the poll question submitted was do you want whitby to leave scarborough borough council and north yorkshire county council to become part of the new tees valley combined authority the wording was rejected by sbc as unlawful so the poll did not take place the editor of the whitby gazette newspaper used his editorial comment column to slam the leadership of sbc wg fri 04 may 2018 saying  but in all the chatter there is a single question why why would people want a town poll its not borne from a sudden desire to join redcar etc as nice as that is it sprouts from a deep dislike of sbcs leadership  and that is the message that needs to be heeded and dealt with whitby people should not take sbcs lack of engagement or public diplomacy personally though sbcs leadership emits contempt for all and sundry and its current manner and style is the talk throughout scarborough among everyone and every organisationapril 1st 2023 north yorkshire council replaces north yorkshire county council and scarborough borough council legislation
