The Court, split four-three dismissed an appeal from the State over the release of three dissident prisoners (political prisoners). According to Section 9 of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995, the Court ruled that it did not have the right to increase the prison sentences of three people who had been sent from England to Ireland to finish their sentences. This case is important as it showed a flaw in the way the Irish prison system carried out prison sentences handed down by courts in other countries. This led to the early release of a number of prisoners.\n\nBackground  \nAfter a failed attempt to get the Iraqi Secret Service to help the Real Irish Republican Army, the appellant and two others were found guilty of plotting to commit a number of terrorist crimes. The accused went to Slovakia thinking that they would meet with Iraqi arms dealers to talk about buying weapons and explosives. It turned out that the meeting was actually a 'sting operation' set up by members of the British Secret Service. The people who were accused were caught and sent back to the UK, where they pleaded guilty in Woolwich Crown Court. They were given a sentence of 30 years in prison, which started when they were caught in 2001. In July 2015, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales reduced their sentences to 28 years. \n \nIn August 2005, the appellant and the co-accused(s) Â asked for a transfer under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 so that they could finish their sentences in Ireland. The State had to do what was required by the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This Act made sure that happened. This is a mostly humanitarian measure that is meant to help prisoners who are serving jail time in a foreign country get back on their feet by letting them finish their sentences in their own country. A person from the Department of Justice wrote to the prisoners and told them that if they took advantage of the transfer, they would have to stay in jail longer. This was because the way sentences are handed down in the two countries are different. At the time, the Criminal Justice Act said that prisoners with sentences longer than a year had to spend two-thirds of their time in jail and then do community service. Under the terms of the English sentence, the prisoners would have been able to get out after 18 years and 8 months. Under the Irish system, a 25% reduction is the most that can be given. In a letter sent back to the Minister of Justice, the prisoners agreed to that condition due to  the transfer. In July 2006, the High Court was asked for warrants so that each prisoner could be relocated to Portlaoise Prison. \n\nWhile the transfers were pending, the sentencing differences between the two jurisdictions in the context of the Transfer of Persons Act 1995 was considered by the Supreme Court in Vincent Sweeney v Governor of Loughlan House Open Centre and Others. In this particular case the appellant had been sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment by an English Court, half of which was to be served in custody with the remaining half on licence. The appellant who had transferred from the United Kingdom to Ireland under the Transfer of Persons, contested his continued detention after his eight years in custody had been served. The Supreme Court came to the conclusion that since there was no facility in Ireland for the appellant to serve his supervised release on licence, he was entitled to be released once he served his custodial sentence. \n\nIn Vincent Sweeney v. Governor of Loughlan House Open Centre and Others, the Supreme Court looked at how the Transfer of Persons Act 1995 affected the differences in sentencing between the two places. In this case, the appellant was given a sentence of sixteen years in prison by an English court. Half of that time was to be served in prison, and the other half was to be served on parole. The appellant, who had moved from the UK to Ireland under the Transfer of Persons Act, argued against his continued detention after his eight years in jail had passed. The Supreme Court decided that since the appellant couldn't serve his supervised release on license in Ireland because there wasn't a place for him to do so, he was entitled to be freed once he finished his prison sentence. \n\nHigh Court \n\nAs a result of the Sweeney decision, O'Farrell filed a habeas corpus petition with the High Court. He said that the warrant justifying his sentence was flawed because it didn't say that he was eligible for release after 18 years, which was part of the original sentence. Article 40.4 of the Constitution says that the High Court has to \"look into\" complaints from prisoners that they were held illegally. In September 2014, Hogan J. ordered that the prisoners be set free because the warrants were flawed because they \"incorrectly\" recorded the sentence was for 28 years instead of 18 years and 8 months.\n\nHolding of the Supreme Court \nSeven judges reviewed appeal from the High Court, who all agreed that the warrants were defective, because of the Sweeney decision. The question was whether the warrants could be altered to demonstrate that the sentences under Irish law were for just over 18 years and would start on the day they were arrested in 2001.\n\nConcurring   \n\nThe State's appeal was dismissed by the majority of  the judges. Laffoy J, MacMenamin J, and O'Malley J all agreed that the High Court could only use section 9 of the 1995 Act to change one or two small parts of the warrants, not the length of the original sentences. Since the sentences given by the English Court were for 28 years and could be overturned after 16 years, the Irish Court did not have the capacity to extend them. MacMenamin J came to the decision  that the way the respondents were detained in Ireland was 'fundamentally defective,' so the warrants were void from the start.   \n\nLaffoy J. agreed with the High Court's reasoning and found that the Minister for Justice had tried to add new conditions to the sentences, which should have happened during the adaptation process before the transfer.   \n\nUsing the trial judge's method, he was under pressure to come to the decision that the changes requested by the Minister, which completely eliminate the \"release on licence in the community\" portion of the sentence and change, and  change, the legal nature and length of the state that handed down the sentence. This required the creation of an adoption order in 2006 and cannot be handled by an order to change the sentence under Section 9.   \n\nDissenting  \n\nIn a decision that O'Donnell J, Clarke J, and Denham CJ wrote together, they said that they would have let the State's appeal go through. O'Donnell J. and Clarke J. looked at the Convention's main humanitarian goal, which was to make it easier for prisoners serving prison sentences in other countries to go back to their home countries to be near their relatives. Even though they agreed that the warrants were wrong, they also said that the sentencing court had a valid order to hold the prisoners. It was also said that s. 9 of the 1995 Act allows for changes so that the goals of the Convention can be met. It was decided that a change to the warrant that made the jail part of the English Sentence work but took away the license part would have been permissible.\n\nSubsequent developments \nIn May 2015, the Irish Examiner reported that a number of prisoners who had been sent from Britain to Ireland under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 had been released on similar terms In 2016, the Minister for Justice put out a statement saying that no more transfer requests could be made under this law until it was clearer. This meant that no more requests could be made, no matter where the prisoner was being held, until the law was made clearer. As of May 2018, transfer requests for countries have been accepted again, and the Chief State Solicitors Office is now working on them. Requests to move from the UK are still on hold because no law has been passed to make it easier to adapt these sentences into Irish law.\n\nReferences \n\nSupreme Court of Ireland cases\n2016 in case law\n2016 in Irish law", "unikey": "O'Farrell and Others v Governor of Portlaoise Prison", "summary": "O'Farrell and Others v Governor of Portlaoise Prison, [2016] IESC 37,[1] [2016] 3 IR 619[2] is a reported Irish Supreme Court decision.

michael christopher mcdonald and declan john rafferty applicantsrespondentsand 2 in furtherance of this international commitment the oireachtas pursuant to article 1521 and article 296 of the constitution enacted the transfer of sentenced persons act 1995 and carried through some amendments in 1997 the 1995 act unless otherwise stated whilst based on and fundamentally reflecting its provisions the legislation did not as such incorporate the convention into domestic law accordingly it is the 1995 act which confers whatever jurisdiction there is on both the relevant minister of government and the superior courts 3 by availing of both these statutory provisions mr ofarrell and the other applicants in the joined proceedings above entitled were transferred to this jurisdiction on the 29th september 2006 to serve the balance of sentences previously imposed upon them in england challenging the legality of their continuing detention they instituted habeas corpus proceedings in june 2014 which were later followed by plenary proceedings in which the constitutionality of s 7 of the 1995 act was impugned those proceedings were held over until all the issues in the article 40 application were dealt with background 5 from the evidence tendered at his trial the applicant who was a member of an illegal organisation styling itself as the irish republican army travelled with others to slovakia in july 2001 in the belief that he and those with him would meet with agents of the iraqi intelligence service from whom they had previously sought arms and financial support over the course of several meetings they outlined details of the munitions and ordinance which they required the agents in fact were members of the british security services who had managed to infiltrate the illegal organisation in question they were arrested on the 5th july 2001 and following their extradition to the united kingdom were charged with a number of grave offences relating to terrorism including conspiracy to cause explosions the accused persons pleaded guilty to such charges at woolwich crown court in may 2002 and were sentenced to thirty years imprisonment in respect of the most serious charge and twelve years on the other charges to run concurrently with the longer sentence the presiding judge directed that the commencement date of all sentences should be the date of their initial incarceration in slovakia namely the 5th july 2001 on appeal the lengthier sentence was reduced to a term of twenty eight years by the court of appeal of england and wales criminal division on the 15th july 2005 it is not suggested that the substituted term should commence from any date other than that as directed by the trial judge 6 in august 2005 the applicant through the appropriate authorities in the united kingdom engaged with the minister for justice equality and law reform the minister seeking to avail of the provisions of the 1995 act the department responded by letter dated the 24th march 2006 in which its officials set out what they considered would be his expected release date if transferred to this jurisdiction allowing for time served or deemed to have been served in england and having due regard to the normal remission of 25 available under rule 59 of the prison rules 2007 si no 2522007 the prison rules that specified date was easily capable of calculation the only variable related to the precise date of transfer which had not yet been ascertained and its effect on the period of remission it was also pointed out in such correspondence erroneously it must be said that as the regime in england provided for one third remission the expected release date for the prisoner if he stayed would be the 29th april 2020 noting those differences in the respective regimes it was thought highly likely in fact a certainty that the actual incarceration period to be served in this jurisdiction would be longer than in the united kingdom 7 on the same date mr ofarrell was also written to based on a hypothetical transfer date of the 1st july 2006 his estimated release date was given as the 20th january 2022 acknowledging that he had read this correspondence and that he had been informed inter alia that i will continue to serve my sentence of 28 years imprisonment as reduced from 30 years imprisonment  and other concurrent sentences as advised in letter of 24th march 2006 he furnished his consent to the requested transfer on these terms and did so by signature verification on the 27th june 2006 being otherwise satisfied that the qualifying criteria had been met and that the sentencing state had so agreed the minister thereafter made an application to the high court seeking the necessary warrant pursuant to s 7 of the 1995 act so that the transfer and subsequent detention could be lawfully validated 8 the high court on application being made issued the warrant on the 27th july 2006 because of its central role in this case its relevant terms which are as follows should be noted warrant the high court warrant pursuant to section 7 of the transfer of sentenced persons act 1995  1997 applicant the minister for justice equality and law reform sentenced person fintan paul o farrell sentencing state the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland crime i conspiracy to cause explosions ii inviting another to provide money or property for the purposes of terrorism iii entering into an arrangement to make money and property available for terrorism sentences in sentencing state a twenty eight years imprisonment for conspiracy to cause explosions at i above b twelve years imprisonment concurrent to the said twenty eight years imprisonment for the offences ii and iii above date of commencement of sentences 7th may 2002 9 thus in clearcut terms allowing for no ambiguity the charges in respect of which sentences were imposed were set out likewise with the terms of imprisonment so imposed firstly on the conspiracy offence the term was twenty eight years and secondly on the offences described at nos ii and iii above the respective terms were twelve years both to run concurrently with the longer term finally the due date for the commencement of the sentences was stated to be the 7th may 2002 10 in july 2014 this court delivered judgment in sweeney v governor of loughlan house open centre  ors 2 ilrm 401 sweeney which both legally and factually had a background not dissimilar to that of the instant case murray j and clarke j in separate judgments held that where a person had been transferred from the united kingdom to ireland under the 1995 act it was only the balance of the actual incarceration period of the imposed sentence which he would have to serve in this jurisdiction and not the remainder of the sanction which under uk law he would be entitled to serve in the community as a statutory right subject to strict conditions permitting his recall in certain circumstances by a combination of how the word sentence was defined in the 1995 act and by reason of the fact that service of a sentence under community licence was not known to irish law that part of the imposed sentence simply fell away and was not enforceable therefore mr sweeney who had been sentenced to sixteen years in england but who under that jurisdictions criminal justice act 2003 was entitled to automatic release from incarceration after eight years could not be detained in this jurisdiction for any period longer than that hence in the particular circumstances and as he had already served this period of time his immediate release was justified 11 in june 2014 after mr sweeney had won his appeal but before this court had given its reasons therefor mr ofarrell initiated an article 40 inquiry into the legality of his continuing detention very much relying at a general level on the arguments previously advanced and very shortly thereafter accepted by the court in sweeney 12 being bound by that supreme court decision hogan j was of the view that since mr ofarrell was in accordance with the statutory regime then applicable entitled to automatic release after two thirds of his sentence was served the s 7 warrant which ex facie specified the sentence term as being twenty eight years was defective in a fundamental way and thus subject to a possible successful application to vary the warrant was of the view that the legality of the applicants ongoing detention could not rest on such basis 13 however the learned judge deferred making an order for the applicants immediate release instead adjourning the article 40 inquiry for what transpired to be two weeks so as to permit the minister for justice if she saw fit to make an application under the relevant statutory provision to amend the warrant such an application was in fact made two variations were sought the first was that the period of imprisonment should be specified as eighteen years and eight months and not twenty eight years as stated this to reflect both the uk situation which would have meant automatic release for the prisoner after serving two thirds of his sentence and the sweeney interpretation of the 1995 act the second was to correct the date of the commencement of the sentence which by common case was undoubtedly the 5th july 2001 applying principles similar to the slip rule hogan j acceded to the latter application however because of the fundamental nature of the first variation sought he declined to so vary the warrant immediately on delivering such decision he ordered the release of the applicant accordingly he and the other named individuals in these proceedings have been at large ever since 14 the governor as the respondent to the habeas corpus application has served a notice of appeal in which several grounds are raised the applicant has also served a notice of cross appeal alleging that the trial judge was in error in not directing his immediate release upon finding that the warrant was defective alleging that thereafter he had no jurisdiction to continue the inquiry in the circumstances which he did both the relevant grounds of appeal and cross appeal appear through and emerge from the stated position of all parties as subsequently discussed in this judgment 15 in order to fully understand the issues in this case and my decision thereon it will be necessary to consider in some detail both the convention and the 1995 act these are the measures which i will first deal with the convention 16 the principal motivation behind the convention was an attempt under the aegis of the council of europe to achieve some measure of international cooperation in a particular area of criminal law so that both the ends of justice and the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons might better be served this could be accomplished it was thought by permitting such persons to serve their sentences in their home state and within their own communities this step was designed to alleviate the added problems which foreign prisoners endured such as difficulties in communication in coping with customs and cultural differences and the infrequent or even absence of any visitation by their family and friends all of these matters have a detrimental effect on such prisoners accordingly the steps taken to address those issues were soundly based on humanitarian grounds 17 the proposed regime was also considered satisfactory from the point of view of the transferring state provided it was satisfied by the mutuality of the measures agreed upon that the penal aspect of the sentence imposed by its criminal justice system would be maintained subject to such integrity being preserved that state by and large had no further direct interest in those previously convicted and sentenced in its courts there was therefore no impediment from its point of view subject to appropriate safeguards being in place to accommodating this type of programme indeed noting the number of countries which since inception have participated in the convention it seems quite clear that it has widespread general approval amongst nations accordingly all participating states undertook to afford each other the widest measure of cooperation in the implementation of the scheme article 2 18 to achieve its underlying aim the convention in a number of articles makes provision for the effective administration of the proposed scheme some of the matters so covered would be common to all countries but not so in every area from a general perspective there were some overriding provisions for example none of these matters are in controversy in this case 19 realising that there would inevitably be differences between the penal systems existing amongst contracting states including the structure of sentences the convention provided for a choice of model by which its terms could best be implemented further again in the realisation of the diversity which undoubtedly existed at the time  and which would almost certainly further increase in subsequent years  between different administrations in this area of the law provision was also made by which countries when utilising the continuing enforcement model could regulate the imposed sentence if such became necessary so as to avoid any inconsistency or incompatibility with its domestic laws article 102 this process of adjustment was called adaptation a process which features quite prominently in this case 20 two such regimes were outlined one was what is commonly referred to as the continuing enforcement regime with the other being described as the conversion regime basically the difference between both was that in relation to the former the enforcement of the original sentence was to continue subject to the concept of adaptation to which i have just alluded and which i will later return to whereas in the case of the conversion model the administering state substituted for the sanction imposed a sanction prescribed by its own laws for the same or a similar offence this would have the effect that the original sentence would no longer be the direct legal basis for the detention of the transferred individual but rather in its place now stood the domestic sanction so substituted the continuing enforcement regime had its details set out in article 10 of the convention with the conversion model being subject to the provisions of article 11 21 each contracting party had the option of operating either one or the other regime and could do so either on a case by case basis article 92 or alternatively on signing the convention could deposit with the secretary general of the council a declaration which would have general exclusionary effect article 33 this state by invoking the latter opted for the continuing enforcement model in both its capacity as a sentencing state and as an administering state accordingly the conversion model was not provided for in the implementing legislation even as an option in any individual case in the absence of any such provision and given that the convention is an international instrument with no direct effect fresh legislation would be necessary to utilise that model in any given case 22 article 9 of the convention sets out the general provisions which apply to the administering state when enforcing the sentence imposed these provisions in the regime preferred by this country are further referenced in article 10 which in its material form reads as follows article 10  continued enforcement from both articles two points must be noted firstly that the enforcement of the sentence is governed by the laws of the home state which alone is competent to make all appropriate decisions in that respect article 93 and secondly that the administering state is bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as per the laws of the sentencing state article 101 the 1995 act 23 as important in all as the convention is it of course has no direct effect in this jurisdiction much like many other agreements entered into at intergovernmental level a prime example of which is the european convention on human rights which although signed up to by ireland in 1953 only became directly associated with irish law in 2003 apart from matters covered by european union law all international agreements which are intended to have the force of law in this jurisdiction are subject to oireachtas approval article 296 of the constitution re Ã³ laighlÃ©is ir 93 even when such approval is forthcoming what becomes law is the act as passed and not the preceding agreement para 2 supra accordingly it is to that extent only that the convention on the transfer of sentenced persons applies in this jurisdiction 24 the procedure put in place by the legislation applies to both the possible transfer into and out of the state the former to cover irish nationals or nationals so regarded and the latter to cover sentenced persons regarded as foreign nationals it provided in respect of the inward flow that either the sentencing state or the individual concerned could make an application seeking the consent of the minister for justice to such a transfer the criteria by which such a prisoner qualified were pretty much identical to those set out in the convention so too was the definition of a sentence which was a key issue in sweeney a case very much in point on this appeal thus a sentence was described as meaning obviously the act also included a requirement that the sentencing state would have to agree to any suggested or proposed transfer 25 in order to facilitate the transfer and the lawful taking into custody of a qualifying person and his or her subsequent detention in this state the process put in place was set out in s 7 of the 1995 act that involved obtaining from the high court a warrant thereby validating the steps necessary to effect such a transfer and detention a s 7 warrant the section with subs 5 and 6 in their original form read as follows 26 the transfer of sentenced persons amendment act 1997 the 1997 act substituted new subsections for subs 5 and 6 and added an additional provision immediately after the existing subs 9 all are of relevance some of considerable relevance in that at least in one respect the amendments have real significance and they must thus be noted 7  5 a on an application to the high court under subsection 1 of this section if the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned is by its legal nature incompatible with the law of the state the court may adapt the legal nature of the sentence to that of a sentence prescribed by the law of the state for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed b the minister may in his or her absolute discretion if he or she thinks it appropriate to do so include in an application to the high court under subsection 1 of this section an application that the court adapt the duration of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned to that of a sentence prescribed by the law of the state for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed and if the minister does so and the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned is by its duration incompatible with the law of the state the court may adapt the duration of that sentence as aforesaid 6 a the legal nature of a sentence adapted under paragraph a of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the legal nature of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either b the duration of a sentence adapted under paragraph b of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the duration of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either 27 there is one other provision of high significance it is contained in s 9 of the 1995 act and enables the minister in relation to a s 7 warrant and in order that effect may be given to provisions of the convention to apply to revoke or vary such a warrant it reads 9  1 if at any time it appears to the minister appropriate in order that effect may be given to the provisions of the convention  the minister may a  b in the case of a warrant under section 7 of the act interpretative approach to domestic legislation 28 it is entirely well established that in seeking to interpret irish legislation either of a primary or secondary level which has been designed to reflect an international commitment previously entered into the same should be informed by and interpreted in a manner consistent with the international law obligations undertaken by this state in becoming a signatory to such convention see for example bourke v attorney general  anor 3 ir 251 thus both the 1995 act and the amending provisions of the 1997 act will have to be looked at and considered in this light summary of essential provisions 29 approaching the act as informed by the convention in this way but disregarding the decision in sweeney for a moment it seems to me that the following can be said at a general level i that at the heart of the convention was a desire backed by humanitarian considerations to make provision for a foreign national to be repatriated to his home country so as to serve the sentence or the balance of the sentence imposed upon him in the transferring state the benefit to such person was that his detention would be within the familiarity of where he was a national and where his family and friends were likely to be ii it was never the aim of the convention at the level of principle that any prisoner would otherwise benefit from such transfer in particular it was not intended that the regime by which he would serve the balance of the sentence would be less onerous than that of the transferring state or that its duration would be more beneficial to him iii however given the likely diversity of the regimes in different contracting states it was clearly recognised that a strict equivalence of either regime or duration may not be possible or indeed even legally achievable so a working compromise was put in place whereby the legal nature and duration of the sentence would still be governed by the laws of the sentencing state whereas the enforcement and administration of the sentence would be covered by the receiving country iv there were good grounds to justify this approach at both ends of the process central to the mutual trust and cooperation between the contracting parties was an obligation on the administering state to uphold the values of the penal regime and the integrity of the sentencing structure which operated in the sentencing state no such state with reputational honour or with due respect for the victims of crime could accept less v however it would not be possible or feasible outside the union and even then only if harmonising measures were in place to expect that the laws of each contracting state regarding the enforcement of a sentence would be the same as this case clearly demonstrates even with a jurisdiction which so closely shares many of our cherished common law values the diversity can be great so subject to the preceding obligation to respect the legal nature and duration of the sentence the laws of the host country were given command over its administration 30 continuing with the effect of the act in the context of the convention but now at a specific level i the steps preparatory to a s 7 application must be in place accordingly the applicant must be or must be deemed to be a national of the state the sentencing process must be at an end as determined by final court order the duration to be served must meet the minimum threshold there must be the necessary correspondence under the laws of england and wales and under irish law concerning the offences of which the applicant had been convicted and the jurisdictions involved must agree to the transfer as obviously must also the prisoner in question s 6 of the 1995 act ii before an applicant can be brought into the state a successful application must be made to the high court for the issue of a warrant a s 7 warrant which if obtained would validate all of the other steps necessary so as to give full effect to the underlying provisions both at domestic and international level iii in particular the statutory effect of such a warrant would be to authorise the continuing enforcement of the sentence in this state in its legal nature and duration as provided for by the law of the transferring state otherwise however the warrant shall have the same force and effect as one imposing a domestic sentence following conviction by an irish court iv it is not contested but that the start date will be that as specified by the trial judge or in default will most likely be the sentencing date and that any time served and remission earned if any before transfer must be allowed for as must be the results of any analogous or similar provisions in the receiving state the former will be governed by the laws of the sentencing state and the latter by those of the administering state these and other similarly categorised relieving measures are well defined and create no difficulty v provision is also made for the suspensioncessation of the power of the sentencing state to enforce the sentence an issue i will return to later in this judgment all of these measures are to be found in ss 6 and 7 of the 1995 act the adaptation process 31 as above stated and as both the convention and the 1995 act make clear a state which opts for the continuing enforcement model is bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as those terms are understood by the laws of the sentencing state however it was also recognised in both of these measures that the sentence informed by its legal nature and duration may be legally or even constitutionally incompatible with the laws of the administering state this difficulty would most likely arise between states which have different legal systems regarding for example a particular sentence such as the death penalty the component parts of penalties in general or the minimummaximum length of sentences the convention would thus be at an end at this point unless the incompatibility could be addressed at least in principle no state could be expected to underpin detention provisions backed by the force of its institutional bodies which were intrinsically inconsistent with its own laws hence the adaptation process provided for in article 102 of the convention and domestically by ss 75 and 6 of the 1995 act 32 in their original wording ss 75 and 6 of the 1995 act were uninformative as to the distinction between legal nature and duration however in the 1997 act these concepts were differentiated and separately dealt with this for a definite purpose para 33 infra as amended the resulting situation can be described as follows i where the imposed sentence is incompatible with the laws of this state by virtue of its legal nature the court on a s 7 application may adapt the legal nature of the sentence to that of a domestic sentence prescribed by irish law for a similar offence ii where the imposed sentence is incompatible with the laws of this state by virtue of its duration the court may subject to the paragraph next following likewise adapt the duration in a manner similar to that set out at subparagraph i above iii both the legal nature and the duration of a sentence so adapted under this process shall correspond as far as practicable to the legal nature and duration of the original sentence as provided for by the sentencing state but shall not in any event either 33 a crucial point of distinction between the original version and the amended version of the subsections in question should be noted prior to 1997 the court of itself when dealing with an application for a s 7 warrant had the power to invoke the adaptation process relative to either or both the legal nature of the sentence or its duration such jurisdiction and its exercise was thus vested in the high court the purpose of the amendment so far as duration was concerned was to make the minister for justice the controlling individual in this regard as appears from the express wording of s 75b of the 1995 act as amended the minister has an absolute discretion when applying for a s 7 warrant as to whether she will or will not seek to include in her application any reference to duration if she doesnt it would appear that the court has no power to issue an adaptation order in that respect even if it was otherwise minded to so do 34 it is said by professor kevin boyle in the annotations made by him on section 7 of the 1997 act iclsa r62 august 1998 that these changes were introduced in the context of the good friday agreement of 1998 so as to facilitate the transfer from england to ireland of certain prisoners who had been sentenced in respect of specified offences to terms of imprisonment sometimes far in excess of that provided for by domestic law in relation to the same offences he continued otherwise that is in the absence of the legislative change grave doubts existed as to whether or not the sentencing state would consent to the transfer of this at the time identifiable cohort of prisoners whether or not that is the case it seems quite clear that in the absence of making an application for and obtaining an adaptation order on the duration aspect of the sentence a prisoner who seeks repatriation may have to serve a custodial term in excess of the maximum prescribed for the same offence by the laws of this state if the sentencing court should have so ordained if however such process has been successfully engaged with the restriction which travels with such an order namely that the domestic maximum cannot be exceeded will apply 36 there is also one other matter which must be mentioned it is entirely impossible in my view to suggest under any disguise that a transferred prisoner can be forced to serve a sentence in excess of the term specified by the final court of the sentencing state murray j in sweeney so confirmed and i am entirely in agreement with this view so if the deadline period is say ten years that cannot be increased this in my opinion is a fundamental pillar of the whole functional mechanism put in place at both international and national level the contrary is neither permissible nor justified and has no basis in the model preferred by this state even where an adaptation order has been made this principle applies therefore it is in my view fundamentally wrong to suggest that a transferred prisoner can be forced to serve in this jurisdiction a sentence in excess of that passed down by the trial court in the sentencing state the difference between the laws of england  wales and those of ireland in this area 37 the law of a foreign jurisdiction is for the purposes of any domestic case a question of fact and like all others must be established in the ordinary way normally affidavit evidence is filed from lawyers who can testify as to their competence and expertise in this area such a course was followed in this case with mr hamish arnold solicitor giving such evidence via an affidavit procured by john m quinn  company solicitors acting on behalf of the applicant and by ms valerie ailes representing the views of both herself and those of mr david perry qc which were contained in an affidavit filed by the chief state solicitor 38 there is no dispute between either deponent as to what the uk statutory regime referable to mr ofarrell would have been if he had continued to serve his sentence in that jurisdiction the position is as follows i under the criminal justice act 1991 as amended those serving a determinate sentence of four or more years were liable to be released after serving one half of their sentence provided the same was approved by the parole board having reached the two thirds point they were automatically entitled to release ii that regime was altered by the criminal justice act 2003 as later amended where those serving determinate sentences for offences committed after 4th april 2005 were automatically entitled to release having served 50 of their sentence at that point the requisite custodial period would have been served and as a result it was the duty of the relevant secretary to release the prisoner ss 2 and 4 of the act such release was on licence with the remaining period being served in the community subject to strict conditions which if breached could in certain circumstances result in the persons recall to prison iii pursuant to the transitional provisions of the 2003 act the applicant who in any event was convicted in 2002 was a person whose crime fell into a particular category where automatic release would only take place at the two thirds point and not at the halfway stage that release would likewise have to be served under community licence again subject to the same conditions including that of recall as earlier mentioned iv accordingly he would have had to serve a custodial period of eighteen years and eight months from the commencement date of his sentence v however the sentence is defined as including the aggregate of both the custodial period and the community licence period s 227 of the act 39 the conditions under which the residue of a sentence has to be served in the community were not extensively dealt with in the evidence nor is it necessary i think to dwell upon them at any great depth in this judgment the reason for this is that the significance of the point under discussion does not rest at a detailed level but rather centres on the structural nature of the sentencing regime in the uk an important part of which is undoubtedly that period served under licence in the community however if one should be so minded reference can be made to the judgment of clarke j in sweeney para 42 for such detail which i have no reason to believe would differ in any way from that pertaining to the instant case 40 in r v governor of brookhill prison ex parte evans no2 2 ac 19 the house of lords in classifying the legal basis on which such conditional freedom rests described it as a right a breach of which is justiciable and can be enforced by the prisoner concerned as can thus be seen the entitlement to release at the point identified is conferred by way of statutory right and is not dependent on the exercise of any discretion nor is it related to any process similar to that of earning remission by good conduct or being deprived of such remission by improper conduct or the like similarly so it is not contingent on or otherwise affected by anything which may occur during the enforcement service or administration of the underlying sentence in addition it is neither subject to the views of any third party nor controlled by the power or authority of any such individual subject to court review the right to automatic release having been given by parliament can be withdrawn or modified only by parliament 41 whilst the case of regina west v parole board regina smith v parole board no 2 1 wlr 350 was centrally concerned with the procedure which the parole board should follow when it was sought to revoke a licence under which the sentenced prisoner had previously been conditionally released nonetheless it is also of interest because lord bingham addressed the nature of a custodial sentence which gives rise to this automatic release entitlement his observations equally apply whether the release date is triggered at the halfway point or at the two thirds stage of the sentence having stated that save in an exceptional case the relevant provisions of the 2003 act should not influence the length of the sentence passed lord bingham at para 24 of the report continued the sentence passed is not as it has not within living memory been a simple statement of the period the defendant must spend in prison the sentence is in reality a composite package the legal implications of which are in large measure governed by the sentence passed that this is a statement of high authority on how such sentences should be viewed is not in doubt 42 the penal system operating in this country has no provision comparable to that which operates in the neighbouring jurisdiction consequently the concept of a prisoner being released to serve a predetermined portion of his sentence under community licence is not known to our law perhaps the nearest which we have is the process of suspending a portion of a sentence which is distinctly different in many respects firstly there is no automatic right in this regard secondly it is not mandated by statutory provision thirdly it is judicially driven and when permitted will necessarily form part of the order of the sentencing judge and finally whilst there is a tendency to attach the same conditions in all such cases nevertheless many individual ones may be added so as to reflect the particular circumstances of the presenting case 44 as is thus self evident the changes or differences between the penal regime operating in england and wales on the one hand and that operating in this jurisdiction on the other are highly significant at certain critical junctures in the process relevant to this case accordingly there is very little reality in suggesting that a meaningful comparison can be made between these two very different systems discussiondecision the estoppel waiver or acquiescence point 45 following the finality brought to the sentencing process by the order of the court of appeal criminal division of the 15th july 2006 mr ofarrell indicated his intention to seek to avail of the provisions of the 1995 act the correspondence in this regard is adequately set out at paras 6 and 7 supra therefrom there can be no doubt whatsoever but that the applicant freely and with full knowledge consented to his transfer to this jurisdiction on the basis of the departments calculations as to his expected release date as set out in its letter dated the 24th march 2006 having referred to the different regimes operating in both jurisdictions it was perfectly evident that he was seen by the department as having to serve the term of twenty eight years in prison less time served in the united kingdom and less remission obtained in this jurisdiction his estimated discharge date was given as january 2022 some twenty months longer than his anticipated release date if he had remained in england the fact that the department was not au fait with the english regime though difficult to understand and never explained is not germane it is therefore suggested on behalf of the appellant that by reason of mr ofarrells full acceptance of this situation he should thereby be prohibited from asserting the illegality of his detention on the grounds so advanced on his behalf 46 this virtually identical point was raised in sweeney and rejected by murray j the learned judge at para 30 of his judgment said i respectfully agree with this view and find considerable difficulty in identifying any basis in law for the contrary suggestion whilst i fully recognise and thoroughly agree that the underlying application in this particular case is without personal or humanitarian merit nonetheless the rule of law must prevail ones consent to an illegal detention cannot change its nature neither can ones objection to a lawful detention concepts such as those under discussion cannot make lawful that which is unlawful if detention is in accordance with law it is valid if not it is invalid 47 this issue was considered by the supreme court in caffrey v governor of portlaoise prison 1 ir 637 caffrey where the chief justice held that a prisoner could not by consent or acquiescence convert or render a detention valid which otherwise was not so she was affirming the decision of the high court in this respect in addition to consent and acquiescence may i add waiver and other analogous concepts whilst these may indeed have a part to play in the lawful exercise by a court of its discretionary jurisdiction they could not act as a substitute for the validity of law accordingly i do not entertain for a moment any doubt but that the conclusion reached in caffrey is entirely correct and can see no justifiable basis for doubting or even questioning its authority i therefore cannot agree with any suggestion that this principle is one appropriate for review in the future as has been proposed elsewhere in conclusion therefore this argument advanced on behalf of the governor is not in my view well founded 48 could i perhaps add one further observation on this matter presumably any argument advanced by a respondent on this point howsoever phrased would relate to the personal conduct of the applicant and based thereon it would be submitted that he or she should be prevented by some principle of law from asserting the suggested illegality of his detention such conduct however could only take effect in personam and could not bind the world at large lets suppose a close member of the prisoners family a minor son and dependant for example made a habeas corpus application could he or she be met with the same point it is at least strongly arguable that he could not one could thus potentially end up with a situation whereby a third party would have the standing to establish the illegality of a prisoners detention whereas the person himself by personal conduct would be prevented from so doing i could not accept that such a situation could be countenanced by law particularly in the context of constitutional liberty the influence of sweeney v governor of loughlan house open centre  ors 2 ilrm 401 sweeney in this case 49 at the date of his conviction for serious drug offences in england mr sweeney in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions then in place was entitled to automatic release from custody after serving 50 of the imposed sentence with the balance to be served under licence in the community that in the circumstances translated into an incarceration period of eight years having been repatriated under the provisions of the 1995 act he was detained in this jurisdiction under a warrant which issued pursuant to s 7 of the act and which specified the term of imprisonment as being one of sixteen years having served 50 of that term he challenged the continuing validity of his detention and the supreme court agreed with his submissions he could not therefore be held for any period in excess of 50 of the original 16year term imposed that is to say 8 years 51 murray j in his judgment was of the view that the issues raised centred on what was or should be regarded as the correct expiry date of the sentence imposed in the united kingdom in effect what form of punishment constitutes a sentence for the purposes of the convention and more importantly for the purposes of the statutory definition of that term in the 1995 act did it in the particular circumstances relate to a term of sixteen years or to the lesser period reflecting only the actual incarceration which mr sweeney would have had to serve under the laws of the sentencing jurisdiction the learned trial judge took the view that the word sentence related solely to deprivation of liberty which in turn could only equate to the actual term of imprisonment which had to be served he was thus satisfied that such in the case of mr sweeney extended only to the eight year period and accordingly after its expiry his continuing detention could not be legally sustained consequently the applicant was entitled to be released or if already released to his unrestricted freedom in effect the balance of the aggregate sentence fell away and was not enforceable under irish law 52 an important point to emphasise was the view of the learned judge expressed on more than one occasion that it was not legally possible for the administering state to insist upon a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment in excess of that which had originally been provided for by the sentencing state para 36 supra 53 clarke j in arriving at the same conclusion analysed the issue in a slightly different way and did so by considering whether or not the conditional release period of the sentence could properly be regarded as part of its enforcement or whether it was governed by english law as affecting the legal nature and duration of the sentence if the former then at least an argument could be made for suggesting that the remission principles applicable in this jurisdiction would take precedence over the community licence portion of the sentence and therefore mr sweeneys detention for a period in excess of eight years might be capable of justification however the learned judge was of the view that given the statutory framework within which the penal regime now operates in the united kingdom the release period could only be regarded as touching upon the legal nature of the sentence and accordingly was subject to uk law in addition he was also of the view that the term sentence as used in the 1995 act referred solely to the period of actual imprisonment paras 411 and 412 of the judgment being thus satisfied in such circumstances that mr sweeney could not be detained in this jurisdiction for any period in excess of that for which he could lawfully have been detained in the united kingdom it followed that only the eight year incarceration period would have to be served in this country as that period had expired mr sweeneys freedom was guaranteed 54 it has not been suggested during argument that the decision in sweeney should be revisited by this court in fact the governor with whom the minister for justice can be associated sought to operate its provisions in the instant case by suggesting that the relevant term of imprisonment set out in the high court warrant should be regarded as referring to a term of eighteen years and eight months only this to reflect the two thirds provision then applying to the offences under the united kingdoms law the appellant would only therefore seek to detain mr ofarrell for this length of time to underpin the point it was suggested that the warrant even in its original form could be viewed to this effect a submission which i must say i did not understand it was also suggested in the alternative that the power to vary under s 9 of the 1995 act was such as to enable the leave court and certainly this court to amend the warrant so as to reflect the governors current thinking in this respect the meaning of sentence 55 as referred to above the meaning of sentence was critical to the sweeney decision it is described in the 1995 act in precisely the same terms as in the convention and is said to mean any punishment or measure involving deprivation of liberty emphasis added in holding that a punishment or measure could only be a sentence insofar as it related to actual incarceration the sweeney decision equated a sentence solely and exclusively with the deprivation of liberty indeed it treated the word sentence as being synonymous with the phrase deprivation of liberty the consequences of so doing were stark there was simply no place for the community licence obligations which had to be and were disregarded whilst of course i fully respect the decision it might be said to reflect quite a narrow view of the concept of a sentence which against the background of an international convention might have merited a wider or more general interpretation furthermore the qualifying word involving deprivation of liberty does not appear to have been directly addressed in any event this question of a sentence is a point to which i will revert again when considering the adaptation process 56 disregarding the observation last made for a moment there can be no doubting the fact that in the circumstances and by virtue of sweeney the applicant in this case cannot be forced to serve or otherwise be detained in this jurisdiction for any period longer than the date upon which he would have been entitled to automatic release if he had remained in england in other words after eighteen years and eight months had been served that inevitable conclusion feeds directly into a central point in this case which is that irrespective of what the correct period may be the applicant can only be detained in accordance with law hence the validity of the high court warrant is directly in issue is the high court warrant defective 57 i do not understand that any of my colleagues who share a similar view to that which i express or those who have a different view including that as to outcome believe that the warrant is otherwise than defective i entirely agree 58 a warrant issued under s 7 of the 1995 act a s 7 warrant can almost be classified as a sui generis warrant in the sense that it is designed to cover a number of steps or events not normally associated with the type of warrants which are regularly issued as part of the criminal justice system certainly it is quite different to a search warrant or a remand warrant or to a warrant issued postconviction whereunder the governor normally of a particular institution is authorised to detain a named individual for the purposes of serving the sentence imposed upon him a s 7 warrant has wider import it authorises the bringing into the state of the sentenced person from a place outside the state and thereafter the continuing enforcement in this state of the sentence imposed in a foreign jurisdiction these are unique features of a s 7 warrant however it must also be noted that even with those features and subject only to the question of remission which is not presently relevant such a warrant by virtue of s 74 of the 1995 act is otherwise ir 73 59 i feel there can be no argument but that such a warrant must ex facie or at least when read in conjunction with accompanying or associated documents specify not only for the governor concerned but also for the sentenced person the term of imprisonment which the authorising court had previously imposed on that person the term as recorded must accurately reflect what was handed down by the sentencing court it is a fundamental requirement upon which the legal authority to detain a convicted person in custody is based that the jailer should know precisely the term of the sentence imposed and the date of its commencement there is no room for genuine ambiguity or uncertainty in either regard it is equally essential that the prisoner should likewise have access to this information such a requirement seems so obvious as not to require authority but if authority is needed there is much of it 60 in his judgment in carroll v governor of mountjoy prison 3 ir 292 peart j reviewed some of the earlier authorities and stated at 303 34 a fundamental requirement for any authority to detain a person in custody is that the person detaining and the person detained should know precisely the duration of such detention 35 as stated by haugh j in the state caddle v judge mccarthy  ors ir 359 at p 365 those warrants seem to possess a twofold purpose when a sentenced person is still at liberty they enable the court through the police to apprehend and detain by force if necessary such person  their second function is to inform the governor of the identity of the prisoner the offence of which he has been convicted and the nature and duration of the sentence 36 in the same case kingsmill moore j while concurring with the judgment delivered in that case by odaly j took the opportunity to say the following at p 379 in relation to the need for precision in the warrant as to the duration of sentence it seems to me that an authority to keep a man in prison must state with precision and without possible ambiguity the duration of the imprisonment and that such duration and any other incident of the imprisonment stated in the warrant must correspond with the sentence legally imposed i am not satisfied that the warrants in this case answer these requirements 37 the topic is referred to in prison law by paul anthony mcdermott albeit in the context of an order of transfer of a prisoner by the minister for justice under s 17 of the criminal justice administration act 1914 where the author states the following at para 1110 no reference to period of detention since the order of transfer is the authority under which the governor of the receiving prison detains the transferred person it should show on its face or by reference to some other document accompanying it the period for which the prisoner is to be detained a failure to do this will mean that the transferred prisoner is not being lawfully detained mr mcdermott refers also to the judgment of murnaghan j in the state holden v governor of portlaoise prison reported sub nom the state dickinson v kelly ir 73 at p 80  again in the context of the ministerial transfer of prison order  where the importance is stressed of specifying on the face of the document or by reference to some accompanying document the period for which a person is to be detained 61 in j og v governor of cork prison 2 ir 203 the same judge said inter alia that see also mullen v governor of midlands prison ieca 26 16th december 2014 subject to the following observation which is added for clarity only i respectfully agree with the review and with the authorities cited in carroll and with these passages in j og 62 the reference in the cases above mentioned to the duration of the sentence must of course be understood as referring to the term of imprisonment as handed down by the trial court that is what both the governor and the prisoner need to know as well as being essential to the court on any article 40 inquiry the actual period of incarceration served will of course take into account any remission which the prisoner may be entitled to on foot of the prison rules this however was always considered a matter of administration and thus fell to be determined by the governor who was presumed to know the regulations and who on request could calculate an expected release date on the basis of full remission earned for these reasons it was never a requirement that a release date be specified in the warrant what was essential and what the case law demanded was that the term so imposed would be specified with no uncertainty as would be the correct date of its commencement 63 at a more general level the requirements for a valid warrant were also discussed by denham cj in giving the judgment of the supreme court in ge v governor of cloverhill prison iesc 41 ge although the warrant in that case had been issued under s 5 of the immigration act 2003 the statement of principle by the chief justice applies with equal force to all warrants at para 31 she said 64 a warrant should not be vague uncertain or cause confusion it must of course be accurate and in a case such as the instant one should reflect the true nature and duration of the sentence where an adaptation order has been granted certain adjustments may have to be made that is not the case here i cannot see how a warrant specifying a term of twenty eight years can be said to reflect a term of eighteen years and eight months which the governor says is the correct term it cannot be so regarded in the absence of extraneous documentation capable of being read as explaining this difference the warrant in my view is flawed in a fundamental way and thus is seriously invalid no such documentation exists in addition another matter of deep concern is demonstrably apparent from the draft corrected warrant which was exhibited as part of the section 9 application and which the appellant seeks to have substituted for that which was issued by the high court on the 27th july 2006 under the heading sentence of imprisonment imposed in the sentencing state is inserted the first description at subparagraph a without explanation is entirely false and fundamentally misstate the true and accurate position it would have to be rejected even on that basis in any event it follows from what i have previously stated that in my view the existing warrant in its current form cannot establish the necessary basis to withstand an article 40 inquiry into the legality of mr ofarrells ongoing detention 65 leaving aside for a moment the possible consequences of the warrants invalidity the question now arises as to whether the defects outlined can be cured for certainly they cannot be overlooked i could not for a moment regard them as inconsequential or without effect a point i will return to in more detail when dealing with the cross appeal paras 101104 infra i am of course speaking specifically about the duration point as i am satisfied that the high court was correct in believing that it had the power under s 9 of the 1995 act to vary the warrant by substituting the correct start date of the prison term even though the appellant at least at one stage submitted that the high court and as would follow this court had inherent jurisdiction to effect the necessary variation that avenue very properly in my view has not now been pursued the power of correction if the same should exist is to be found only within the provisions of the said s 9 of the act 66 however before turning to that issue i would like to go back to one aspect of the adaptation process with which i wish to deal is the imposed sentence incompatible with irish law 67 at paras 3744 of this judgment i have set out the relevant ingredients of the penal system in the united kingdom and also those which pertain in this jurisdiction considering the former i have had due regard for the relevant statutory provisions as well as how lord bingham in regina smith v parole board no 2 described the nature of a sentence which is subject to the automatic release provision followed by release on community licence it seems to me that such a sentence for english law purposes cannot be properly described as one consisting only of the incarceration aspect of it to do so is a direct contradiction of statute law and lord binghams description of it being  in reality a composite package para 41 supra the package even if in two parts and with two elements must be considered as one as a unitary sentence or punishment imposed on the convicted person by a court of competent jurisdiction i would have little doubt but that a sentence involving a jail term only is quite different to one involving such combined restrictions on personal liberty and would be so regarded by both the judiciary and parliament alike 68 such sentences apart from the judicial imposition of the original term have been structured in a particular way by parliament for specific reasons which at a general level are in part deducible from the role which the parole board plays in any attempted revocation of the community licence that structure at the level of principle which is not as such punitively driven is unrelated to the conduct or behaviour of the prisoner during his prison term or to any other aspect of that terms enforcement or management to that extent it therefore differs from incarceration per se however both merge to form the imposed sentence in my view therefore the licence aspect cannot but be regarded as forming an essential part of the legal nature of the sentence as that term is understood in both the convention and the 1995 act clarke j so held in sweeney and i agree 69 the process of adaptation of a sentence such as is permitted by and referred to in sections 75 and 76 of the 1995 act arises only in the context of a sentence which by its legal nature or duration is incompatible with the law of the state article 102 of the convention uses the same language incompatible with the law of the administering state what then is meant by incompatibility in this context the term is not defined in either the convention or the act nor is it mentioned in the explanatory report to the convention as generally understood the term denotes an inconsistency an inability to coexist with something else it means that when the measures in question are put side by side they are substantially irreconcilable used in this way and noting the legal context involved the term strongly suggests that a sentence which could not validly be imposed by or exist under irish law should be described as incompatible with the law of this state though lawful in the sentencing state the sentence imposed would in such circumstances be incongruous within the legal regime of the administering state it is as a result of any such inconsistency with irish law that the adaptation provisions become relevant 70 this phrase legal nature is of wide meaning and evidently even without the express provision of s 710 of the 1995 act is distinct from duration it was considered in caffrey where the applicant had been given in the united kingdom a mandatory life sentence for murder such a sentence has two distinct elements to it in that jurisdiction the first sometimes called the tariff requires the judge to nominate a minimum period which must be served by way of punishment and general deterrence once that has expired any further detention is justified on preventative grounds that is on grounds of public protection this aspect of the life sentence was in the opinion of fennelly j with whom murray j agreed related to the legal nature of the sentence it seems to me that similar considerations apply between that and the community licence aspect of the applicants sentence in relation to the mandatory life sentence for murder the tariff represents the general punitive or retributive aspect of the sentence with further detention justified on preventative grounds in respect of the unitary sentence at issue in the present case the period of incarceration similarly serves the primary punitive function with the period of release on community licence satisfying an essentially rehabilitative purpose i am therefore in no doubt but that such falls within the legal nature of the sentence imposed this was in any event the conclusion of the clarke j in sweeney para 53 supra consequently each signature state is internationally and through its domestic laws nationally bound to uphold the sentence as so structured unless the same is incompatible with the laws of its own state that in turn raises two questions firstly how is that to be determined and secondly if established how if at all can it be addressed 71 it may be asked whether article 501 of the constitution can shed any light on the meaning of incompatibility that provision reads of course it is acknowledged that as adverted to by walsh j in his judgment in state sheerin v kennedy and others he situation which is being examined in that article is whether a law which is valid on a certain date may cease to have effect because notwithstanding its initial and original validity it is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution nothing more informative comes from that decision indeed the situation remains very much the same from a perusal of subsequent cases which despite the observations of walsh j have largely held that the term inconsistent in article 501 may be regarded as synonymous with the term incompatible 72 a single reference will illustrate this point in murphy v the attorney general ir 241 henchy j stated at p 306 that the issue to be determined when assessing a law under article 501 is whether when the impugned provision is set beside the constitution or some particular part of it there is disclosed an inconsistency in substance therefore very little assistance is obtained from this source consequently i think that first principles apply 75 based on this analysis and having due regard to the composite structure of the imposed sentence both aspects of which must be recognised i am entirely satisfied that the sentence handed down to mr ofarrell is incompatible with the laws of this state as previously outlined there is no provision in our national laws for accommodating facilitating implementing or otherwise reflecting the second stage of the unitary sentence imposed by the english court i am fortified in this regard by what the court did in sweeney even if determined on a different basis simply to have to disregard the licence aspect of the sentence is self evidence of its inconsistency with irish law i therefore have no doubt as to this conclusion obiter remarks 76 it is of course fully acknowledged that no application was made to the court under s 75 or 6 of the 1995 act to have the imposed sentence adapted under the provisions of these subsections it is also accepted that any such application would have to form part of the initial application made to the high court for the issue of a s 7 warrant not having been done at that time it is now too late to contemplate it there is simply no longer any scope for its use 77 although in such circumstances the issue does not strictly arise nonetheless i would have considerable doubt that the court even had such an application been made could have adapted the structure of the english sentence in such a way firstly as to preserve the integrity of the underlying regime and comply with the provisions inter alia of these subsections and secondly and more importantly to put in place a result which could with any legal reality be said to correspond as far as practicable to the legal nature of the imposed sentence s 76a of the 1995 act the 1995 act does not require the adapted sentence to be a mirrorimage of the original one  this is inherent in the concept of adaptation  but in my view even adapting the sentence as far as practicable is not sufficient if the sentence as adapted does not in any meaningful way correspond with the legal nature of the sentence as originally imposed to correspond denotes a particularly close degree of similarity or equivalence thus if the adapted sentence could not be said to bear any real correspondence with that imposed in the sentencing state then notwithstanding that the adapted sentence is as close in legal nature to the original as could be imposed under irish law i take the view that the adaptation process cannot be utilised at all 79 noting the international background to the 1995 act and the obligation on participating states to accord each other the widest possible cooperation in implementing the provisions of the convention i would be prepared to adopt any recognisable interpretative approach to achieve the desired end if the same was constitutionally plausible and legally possible but not in such a manner as to breach the contra legem rule that being so it seems to me that a major difficulty arises with the community aspect of the sentence in my view considering how such sentences are regarded in england it is not legally possible for section 7 purposes to simply ignore that aspect of the sentence it forms a critical part in the overall structure without which it is highly unlikely that automatic release would have been provided for at all or that it would be available after 50 of the term or as in the case of mr ofarrell 75 of the term has been served thus it is a key aspect of the overall punishment or sanction and whilst it may be driven by considerations not directly based on punishment or deterrence but rather on social rehabilitation nonetheless it remains a crucial element 80 as is common case it is not possible in accordance with our domestic law to give any effect to such provision this remains the situation whether an adaptation order has or has not been made i therefore have grave doubts that even if the minister in the original application sought relief under ss 75a and 6 of the 1995 act that it would have been possible for the court to craft an order to reflect what in my view are the essential elements of the sentence see also what laffoy j had to say on this point at paras 52 and 53 of her judgment in this case 81 it must also be remembered that the power to adapt applies to the sentence not to the warrant whilst no doubt conferring a wide jurisdiction the exercise is not without limit as the command in s 76a of the 1995 act shows it would not be possible in my view to convert the imposed sentence into one that effectively captures the core elements of the sanction as prescribed by the sentencing court the essentials of the sentence must be preserved if radically different the process becomes ineffective and will not sustain the nucleus of the international scheme or the cohesion of the original sentence the approach of the court when asked to adapt must therefore have regard to this fundamental driver of the overall project 82 in the instant case how could one in any way reflect the community licence aspect of the sentence i fear one would have great difficulty in doing so short of embarking on an exercise which appears strikingly close to legislating in making these observations i am doing no more than simply pointing out the obvious namely that the uk regime has developed in a fundamentally different way to our system and so stands at the present time 83 finally may i say that with the radical differentiation which now exists between the respective penal systems as operating in england and in ireland it may not be possible within the parameters as outlined to achieve any feasible outcome following the adaptation process which could sustain a credible challenge even with a court exercising the greatest permitted degree of flexibility however i recognise that these observations are obiter and will have to await definitive decision if and when such an issue should arise in any given case perhaps in the intervening period some reassessment or reevaluation is called for power to vary 84 under s 9 of the 1995 act the minister at any time may apply to the high court to revoke or vary the s 7 warrant or any of its provisions the purpose of both the application for and the granting of such an order is to give effect to the provisions of the convention the court is empowered to make whatever order it considers appropriate 85 following the delivery of the main judgment in august 2014 the learned judge who alluded to this provision in that judgment continued the article 40 inquiry so as to permit the minister for justice to issue a motion under the section if she so wished she did so and hogan j having considered the application delivered a second judgment solely on this issue on the 11th september 2014 for the reasons therein set out he stated that he did have the power under the section to substitute the correct commencement date of the sentence but did not have the power to alter the period of the sentence by substituting for the term of twenty eight years a term of eighteen years and eight months and for the lesser sentences correspondingly reduced terms see para 64 supra he thus declined to do so having reached that conclusion and in light of his earlier decision regarding the invalidity of the warrant he directed the immediate release of mr ofarrell and the other applicants named above 86 as i have mentioned earlier in the scheme of the 1995 act a sharp distinction was made by the oireachtas between the powers conferred by s 7 on the one hand and by s 9 on the other the former in subs 5 and 6 relate to the sentence the latter deals with the warrant again the former speaks of the power to adapt whereas the latter refers to the power to revoke or vary whilst no question of revocation arises in this case it might occur in a pardon amnesty or commutation situation it might also be appropriate as a result of any judicial review by the sentencing state of the conviction andor sentence likewise for example if parliament intervened in such a way that a particular cohort of prisoners should be unconditionally released after a certain time period and that period had already been served see s 78 of the 1995 act these are but illustrations in any event the point does not arise what concerns us however is what the power to vary means when seen in the contextual setting of the act as a whole and in particular s 7 thereof 87 to vary connotes a change or an alteration of some term or provision which does not go to the essence of the subject matter itself the analogy which hogan j drew with order 28 rule 11 of the rules the slip rule bears a reasonable relationship to the kind of meaning and intended use of the power given in s 9 of the 1995 act i am satisfied that the distinction between the power to adapt and the power to vary must be maintained these terms as the learned trial judge said are not interchangeable and are not intended to have the same meaning the conditions for their exercise are individual to each other not simply in respect of timing but also relative to the correspondence obligation and the nonaggravation and capping requirements of s 75 and 6 of the act the contrast between both should not therefore be judicially collapsed evidently the power to adapt would include the power to vary but the converse is not the case the breadth of what the governor seeks from this court under the s 9 application can be instantly seen from a direct comparison between the issued s 7 warrant para 8 supra and the suggested amended version which i have referred to above para 64 supra it entails a fundamental alteration to the most critical command contained in the warrant not only that but in reality it also seeks by way of judicial declaration to have declared that the courts of trial and appeal did not impose a 28year sentence but rather a term of 18 years and 8 months this is not simply a correction to the warrant it amounts to a complete substitution of the term this to me cannot be achieved under the guise of a variation i therefore cannot accept that such a provision can be utilised in the most farreaching way as the appellant suggests accordingly the defects in the original warrant as above outlined cannot be cured in this manner 88 if such result is at all attainable involving as it does the discarding of an aspect of the aggregate sentence it could only possibly come about via an adaptation order made under s 7 of the 1995 act as i understand it all of my colleagues who form the majority of the court believe that such is the only possible avenue to this end that the imposed sentence is in its entirety incompatible with irish law is scarcely in doubt paras 6775 supra indeed it is inherent from and formed an essential part of the sweeney judgment therefore any change as radical as that proposed could only conceivably emerge from a s 75 and 6 application however for the reasons above given i firmly believe that even if such an application had been made the suggested result was not legally achievable the consequences of the defect 89 there is no doubt but that the only lawful authority upon which mr ofarrell could be detained in this jurisdiction rests on the s 7 warrant for the above reasons i am satisfied that it suffers from a substantial infirmity which cannot be regarded otherwise than in a manner commensurate with its importance consequently in my view it is invalid the majority of the court so agree and the same conclusion is obviously inherent in the judgments of the other members of the court this inescapably follows because if the established defects did not in the first place merit a release order then there would have been no necessity to consider the potentially curative provisions of s 9 therefore the warrant cannot be relied upon to further mr ofarrells incarceration 90 in coming to this conclusion i am not to be taken as expressing any view as to what other consequences if any such a conclusion leads to i am satisfied that it can no longer be relied upon as a legal basis for detaining mr ofarrell and that is the extent of my finding there has been no debate in this case on any wider or further consequences if such should exist the warrant disregarding the start date was issued in terms which reflected what was then regarded as the correct legal position that continues to be so in england in respect of the committal warrant but following the decision of this court in sweeney not so in this jurisdiction for the s 7 warrant the invalidity identified in the instant warrant is intrinsically linked to that decision what further consequences may exist will be a matter for another day 91 on a related matter i should also say that the consequential effect of my conclusion in this case must also await further debate the point which i refer to is this under article 8 of the convention the taking into charge of a prisoner by the administering state has the effect of suspending the further enforcement of the sentence in the transferring state it is only when the enforcement of the sentence has been completed that the residual power of the sentencing state inherent in the suspending measure is spent provision is made by which that information is exchanged between the states involved if there are domestic measures in either or both jurisdictions which reflect this provision it remains to be seen which exactly these are likewise with how either state will view the situation resulting from this judgment the cross appeal 92 the applicant has crossappealed one aspect of hogan js judgment of the 26th august 2014 wherein the learned judge held that as the defects in the warrant in the present case fell into an intermediate category of error he would adjourn the article 4042 application for a short time to allow the minister to apply to the high court under s 91b of the 1995 act to have the terms of the existing warrant varied to reflect the correct duration of the sentence accordingly hogan j did not at that time order the release of the applicant from custody it was not until this issue had been determined in his judgment of the 11th september 2014 that hogan j directed the release of the applicant in accordance with article 4042 the applicant submits that the learned judge fell into error in declining to order his release from custody upon being satisfied that the warrant was invalid on the 26th august 2014 93 article 4042 of the constitution provides as follows 94 with the rarest of exceptions in fact with no exception as such that i am aware of see para 97 infra the position is that a complainant whose detention is found not to be in accordance with law is to be released immediately otherwise this mandatory constitutional bedrock is in effect being neutralised finlay cj in state trimbole v the governor of mountjoy prison ir 550 at 567 stated that further at p 570 of the report it is stated that 97 notwithstanding that the default position in a successful article 4042 application is that of immediate release there may be some exceptional circumstances in which the court will depart from this general rule in n v health service executive 4 ir 374 referenced in the judgment of denham cj above murray cj stated that 98 on the facts of the case murray cj concluded that 99 thus the situation may be summarised as follows the default position upon a finding that a complainant under article 4042 is not being detained in accordance with law is that the high court should order the immediate release of that complainant it is established law that there is no provision in the constitution for a stay on such an order or for a deferral of the persons release however there may be special circumstances such as those outlined by murray cj in n v hse in which the court may need to make ancillary or interim orders as part of an orderly release process so as to protect the rights of the article 4042 complainant pending the making or implementation of the substantive order 101 with the utmost respect to the learned judge whose breadth and scope of constitutional knowledge i wish to acknowledge i must differ from him in the decision which he arrived at on this aspect of the case firstly i am not aware of any line of authority so classifying defects in a committal or detention warrant and i doubt the utility of such an exercise secondly and of more significance is what appears to be the situation namely that the defect in the warrant seems to have a different classification for different purposes intermediate so as to continue the inquiry whilst at the same time sufficiently serious if unremedied as to render the prisoners detention incompatible with law thirdly it seems quite clear that the legality of mr ofarrells detention had been established at the end of the first hearing certainly it does not appear that any further evidence or submissions were made on that issue thereafter accordingly the warrant was not any more or less defective after the second hearing than it was at the conclusion of the first in any event hogan j himself so confirmed at para 43 of the first judgment where he said it is thus therefore beyond doubt but that the inquiry as to the current legality of the respondents detention had concluded at that point fourthly the stated purpose of the adjournment was to afford the minister an opportunity of trying to rectify that illegality if it was possible to do so fifthly the move under s 9 of the 1995 act was by a different party in different although admittedly related plenary proceedings therefore the rather illdefined power to retroactively validate a defective warrant in habeas corpus proceedings would be very difficult to apply in fact given the nature of the established defect such recourse would in any event have been inappropriate finally no discussion regarding the classification of defects took place in miller where the issue was whether other documents could be joined with the warrant in determining the legality of the applicants detention furthermore the learned judge delivered her final judgment after an overnight consideration of the case judgment of mr justice john macmenamin dated the 12th day of july 2016 introduction 1 on the 19th june 2014 the high court hogan j directed an inquiry into the legality of the respondents detention in portlaoise prison 2 thirteen years earlier in the year 2002 all three respondents pleaded guilty before the english courts to terrorist offences they were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 30 years later reduced on appeal to 28 years duration they commenced serving their prison terms in england in 2006 they availed of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 1995 to 1997 the acts these two statutes were enacted by the oireachtas to allow irish prisoners in other jurisdictions to be transferred to serve out their sentences in irish prisons an application was made to the high court in 2006 for warrants to allow each respondent to be transferred to custody in ireland and thereafter to be detained in portlaoise prison to serve the balance of their sentences 3 the application to the high court on the 19th june 2014 was accompanied by a challenge to the constitutionality of s7 of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 1995 to 1997 however in light of the conclusions which he reached on the article 404 enquiry the high court judge did not consider it necessary to proceed with the constitutional challenge in two judgments consequent on the inquiry delivered successively on the 26th august 2014 and 11th september 2014 the judge held the detention of the respondents was not in accordance with law and directed their release the governor now appeals those decisions the warrant 4 this appeal concerns warrants issued pursuant to s7 of the acts of 1995  1997 it will be helpful now to refer to the relevant terms of the high court warrants the facts of each case do not differ in any material way the relevant sections of the warrant referred to below are those issued in the case of the first named respondent fintan paul ofarrell the other two adopt the same format as follows 39 on closer reading a certain ambiguity is to be found in the second and third emphasised sentences in article 102 are legal nature and duration to be treated as entirely distinct as will be shown this is a matter which was addressed in national legislation 40 what is entirely clear is that the effect of a transfer is to suspend the enforcement of the sentence in the sentencing state article 81 of the convention what occurs in the continued enforcement model must occur under recognition of the ongoing existence of the original sentence no new sentence is substituted for that sentence the sentence is not converted article 9 of the convention provides that prior to a transfer the administering state is to inform the sentencing state as to which procedure it will follow it further provides that the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering state and that that state alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions as the majority of this court held in caffrey enforcement of the sentence is a matter for ireland as the administering state this necessitates the application of the irish parole system enactment of the convention the acts of 1995 and 1997 41 in 1995 the oireachtas legislated so as precisely to identify the sequence and stages of the transfer procedure in this state later by the amending the act of 1997 the oireachtas legislated inter alia to distinguish between the concepts of legal nature and duration one may legitimately infer that one of the objects of the 1997 amendments was to permit the transfer of prisoners while maintaining the integrity of the sentences imposed a further intent then was to ensure a court would be permitted to adapt a sentence that was incompatible by its duration with the laws of the state only where an application in that regard was made by the minister for justice in his or her absolute discretion the motivation behind the amendment was to facilitate the negotiation of transfers with states which insisted that sentences imposed in their own courts could not be reduced while at the same time allowing a mechanism for the adaptation of the duration of the sentence if the state in question had no objection to such a procedure see iclsa cited earlier 42 in consideration of the two statutes it is necessary to be clear at the outset that what is in question is a sentence defined in article 1 of the convention as meaning 1a any punishment or measure involving deprivation of liberty ordered by a court for a limited or unlimited period of time on account of a criminal offence and 1d in referring to an administering state as being that state to which the sentenced person may be or has been transferred in order to serve his sentence section 1 of the act of 1995 refers to sentence in very similar terms as meaning any punishment or measure involving deprivation of liberty ordered by a court or tribunal for a limited or unlimited period of time on account of the commission of an offence whether this definition may be interpreted broadly to encompass remission is not an issue which need arise the scheme of the legislation 43 the acts of 1995 and 1997 obviously deal both with transfer procedures for incoming and outgoing prisoners section 5 of the former deals with the procedure to be adopted for a prisoner being transferred from ireland to another jurisdiction and is not material however the provisions of s6 and s7 as amended are essential to the situation of the incoming respondents in this appeal section 65 of the act the legal status of the high court warrant 44 section 65 of the 1995 act deals with the procedure for prisoners being repatriated to ireland it provides that the minister will not consent to a transfer unless he or she is satisfied that  all reasonable steps have been taken to inform the sentenced person concerned in writing in his or her own language the sentenced person is to be made aware as to the effect on them of their detention on foot of a warrant issued by the high court  emphasis added the warrant then is the keystone for lawful detention in ireland it must correspond with the conditions laid down in the two acts the existence of a valid warrant is a necessary precondition to transfer and detention within the state such warrant should set out as conditions precedent for jurisdiction both the legal nature and duration of the sentence alternatively such matters should be readily ascertainable from supporting documentation or records only then can the bringing of a prisoner into the jurisdiction and his or her subsequent detention be rendered lawful section 7 application to the high court 45 the preliminary stages of an application for transfer are dealt with in ss 71 to 4 of the act of 1995 these remain unamended and provide as follows and s76 provides b the duration of a sentence adapted under paragraph b of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the duration of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either one might well envisage by reference to s7 8 why a revocation of enforcement might arise as a consequence of a decision such as amnesty or review in the sentencing state but in order further to emphasise the distinction between legal nature and duration the oireachtas then provided at s7 10 of the amending act that 9 1 if at any time it appears to the minister appropriate in order that effect may be given to the provisions of the convention that a warrant under this act for the transfer of a person in or out of the state should be revoked or varied the minister may  a in the case of a warrant under section 5 of this act  and b in the case of a warrant under section 7 of this act judgment of ms justice laffoy delivered the 12th day of july 2016 residual controversy 1 each of the applicantsrespondents the respondents on these appeals had spent approximately thirteen years in prison in the united kingdom and in this jurisdiction when on 18th june 2014 each brought an application for an inquiry into the legality of his detention pursuant to article 4042 of the constitution the detention of the respondents in portlaoise prison in this jurisdiction had been on foot of warrants issued pursuant to s 7 of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 1995 the act of 1995 as amended by the transfer of sentenced persons amendment act 1997 the act of 1997 which will hereafter be referred to collectively as the amended act of 1995 it is obvious that what triggered those applications under article 4042 was the decision of this court in sweeney v the governor of loughan house open centre  ors 2 ir 732 sweeney while the judgments of this court in sweeney were delivered on 3rd july 2014 it is clear from the judgment of murray j at para 47 that the court decided on the hearing of the appeal in sweeney on 28th may 2014 that the appellants appeal should be allowed and that reasons for the decision would be given later 2 the underlying chronology and the factual and legal circumstances on these appeals differ from the circumstances in sweeney in particular due to the fact that the sentence in issue in sweeney had been imposed by a court in england and wales after the coming into operation of the criminal justice act 2003 the uk act of 2003 whereas the respondents on this appeal were sentenced by a court in england and wales prior to the coming into operation of that act in broad terms the application of the uk act of 2003 to the sentenced person in sweeney mr sweeney and to the respondents differed in that under the law of england and wales the former who had been sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment would have been entitled to be released on licence having served half of his sentence whereas each of the respondents would have been entitled to be released on licence having served twothirds of his sentence nonetheless the decision of this court in sweeney is determinative of some of the issues which arise on the respondents applications under article 40 although significantly it does not address other issues which arise as a consequence in the judgments delivered by the other members of the court on these appeals there is consensus on many of the issues which have arisen significantly there is consensus that the warrants issued pursuant to s 7 of the amended act of 1995 on foot of which the respondents were detained in prison in this jurisdiction are defective there is also consensus that in 2014 the high court did not have jurisdiction to adapt the warrants because  a the final sentence imposed on mr ofarrell by the court of england and wales was in truth a sentence of approximately 18 years and 8 months inasmuch as the s 7 warrant issued by the high court on the 28th july 2006 under which mr farrell was detained recorded the sentence as one of 28 years the warrant was defective b as the sentencing system in england and wales is so appreciably different from that which obtains in this jurisdiction the sentence in mr ofarrells case should more properly have been adapted pursuant to s 75 of the amended act of 1995 there was a necessity for the sentence to be adapted at the time of the transfer of mr ofarrell to this jurisdiction c the high court can direct the release of an applicant on an application under article 4042 where the warrant is so defective that no proper basis for the current detention has been made by the detainer while the trial judge at that stage in the process characterised the defects in mr ofarrells case as falling into an intermediate category he found that they were too serious to be dismissed as harmless however he concluded that the defects were not at that stage so pervasive as to destroy the validity of the warrant 7 on the basis of those findings the trial judge then stated at para 50 that he proposed to adjourn the application under article 4042 to enable the minister for justice and equality the minister to apply separately to the high court pursuant to s 91b of the amended act of 1995  to vary the existing s 7 order so that the english sentence can be properly adapted into our law and especially that the duration and commencement of the sentence be properly recorded although rule 31 of order 128 of the rules of the superior courts the rules which governs applications under s 9 of the amended act of 1995 provides that an application by the minister pursuant to s 91b shall be made ex parte to the court it was specifically directed that any application brought by the minister should be on notice to mr ofarrell which was appropriate because rule 32 provides that an order may be made by the court for service upon the sentenced person concerned where that person is likely to be adversely affected in any way by the making of an order under s 9 the trial judge made it clear that he envisaged that the ministers application if brought would be determined expeditiously which in fact occurred 8 the order of the high court on the ofarrell application under article 40 dated 26th august 2014 recited that the court had found that the warrant as it stood was defective in the curial part of the order it was ordered that  eighteen 18 years and eight 8 months imprisonment for the offences sic at i above and a that the warrant incorrectly stated that the date of commencement of the sentences imposed on mr ofarrell was 7th may 2002 rather than the correct date 5th july 2001 and b that the warrant stated that the sentence imposed in the sentencing state on mr ofarrell for the first of the three crimes listed was twenty eight years imprisonment and that the minister was seeking that the duration of the sentence be changed from that to eighteen years and eight months so the authority given by the warrant issued by the high court on the ministers application relates to  a bringing the sentenced person into the state b taking that person to the specified place of detention in the state and c detaining the person in the state at the specified place in short what is to be authorised by the warrant is continued enforcement of the sentence both in its legal nature and duration continued enforcement is one of the two procedures provided for in the convention at article 9 for giving effect to the transfer to the administering state the other being conversion of the sentence that the effect of the warrant issued under s 7 is expressly subject to subs 5 and subs 6 is of considerable importance on these appeals in the determination of the extent of the jurisdiction conferred by s 9 in the context of the amended act of 1995 as a whole having regard to the provisions of article 10 of the convention by contrast neither s 75 and 6 nor article 10 were considered by this court to be of particular relevance to the determination of the issue which arose in sweeney 24 viewing s 7 from the perspective of the convention the template for the authority conferred by the oireachtas by virtue of subss 5 and 6 is article 102 thereof article 101 provides that in the case of continued enforcement  25 accordingly while article 102 makes provision for an adaptation process where necessary when the administering state is implementing the continued enforcement of the sentence by availing of power to adapt the sentence in addition to the requirement that the sentence as adapted shall as to its nature correspond as far as possible to the sentence to be enforced that is to say the sentence imposed by the sentencing state article 102 imposes limitations on the manner in which the administering state may effect such adaptation those limitations are the requirements that the sentence as adapted by its nature or duration  the legal nature of a sentence adapted under paragraph a of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the legal nature of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either  33 it is unnecessary to consider the concerns of counsel for mr ofarrell arising from the foregoing very troubling submission which concerns are premised on the proposition that the minister in 2006 intended to give effect to a sentence of twenty eight years imprisonment and that the warrant issued under s 7 by the high court reflected that reality the reason why it is not necessary to do so is because immediately following the passage in the submissions on behalf of the governor which i have quoted above it is stated that by virtue of the decision of this court in sweeney  if at any time it appears to the minister appropriate in order that effect may be given to the provisions of the convention that a warrant under this act for the transfer of a person in    the state should be revoked or varied the minister may  a    b in the case of a warrant under s 7 of this act  subsection 2 provides that on an application under para b of subs 1 the high court may make an order  39 as outlined at the beginning the residual controversy is whether s 9 confers jurisdiction on the high court and on this court on appeal to vary the s 7 warrants issued on 28th july 2006 in the manner sought by the minister and proposed to be ordered in the joint judgment of odonnell j and clarke j at para 911 that is to say to provide for imprisonment for a period of days calculated by eighteen years and eight months less the period served in england and the period served in ireland plus remission earned in this jurisdiction it may be observed that the formula suggested in the joint judgment differs ex facie from the wording of the terms of the variation which the minister sought by reference to the draft amended warrant exhibited in mr mcdonaghs affidavit having regard to the wording of the terms of the varied warrant as suggested in that exhibit what the minister was seeking was to have both the legal nature and the duration of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state fundamentally changed what the minister sought was that the varied warrant would describe the sentences in the sentencing state as sentences of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing state and would describe the duration of the sentence for the first crime as eighteen years and eight months that description merely includes the requisite custody period in accordance with the uk act of 2003 that is to say as regards each of the respondents twothirds of his sentence but not the period of release on licence with the possibility of recall as applicable in accordance with the law of england and wales that raises the question whether the formula suggested in the joint judgment although worded differently is in substance any different from the terms of the variation sought by the minister in substance it is not in that it merely makes it easier to identify the end point of the varied period of detention sought by the minister and it properly records that remission earned must be factored in in identifying the end point 40 therefore the core issue which must now be considered is whether s 9 confers jurisdiction on the high court to make the fundamental changes sought by the minister to the warrants issued under s 7 in 2006 on the motion to vary 41 before addressing that issue it is convenient to consider submissions which were made by counsel for one of the respondents declan john rafferty mr rafferty on the rehearing of the appeal which focused on the sequence of the provisions of the amended act of 1995 dealing with transfers into the state and their proper application on these appeals having regard to the judgments in sweeney therefore i propose to take an overview of ss 6 and 7 in the light of those submissions overview of sections 6 and 7 42 section 6 provides that the minister may accede to a request either by the sentencing state or by the sentenced person to serve the sentence or the balance of the sentence in the state on acceding to such a request the minister is directed by s 71 to apply to the high court for the issue of a warrant authorising inter alia the bringing of the sentenced person into the state the high court in turn is directed by s 72 to issue such a warrant if it is satisfied that the requirements stipulated in that subsection have been fulfilled where a warrant is issued its effect under s 74 is to authorise the continued enforcement by the state of the sentence    in its legal nature and duration subject however to the provisions of inter alia subss 5 and 6 of s 7 as counsel for mr rafferty emphasised in a situation such as arose in the case of each of the respondents where the sentence is not adapted the only effect of a warrant issued under s 7 is to authorise the continued enforcement of the sentence or the balance of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state in its legal nature and duration 43 when the high court on foot of the ministers application on 28th july 2006 made orders authorising the bringing of the respondents into the state taking the example of mr rafferty the sentence imposed by the sentencing state in accordance with the law of the sentencing state to use the words of lord bingham quoted by murray j in sweeney at para 41 was a composite package the composite package comprised two components a period of imprisonment equivalent to twothirds of the sentence and a period of release on licence in the community equivalent to the remaining onethird of the sentence counsel for mr rafferty submitted that in those prevailing circumstances all the high court had jurisdiction to do on 28th july 2006 was to issue a warrant authorising the continued enforcement of both components of the sentence however in the absence of adaptation the second component could not be enforced in this jurisdiction because as murray j stated in sweeney at para 43 there is no provision in irish law for such a form of licensed release counsel identified in my view correctly the source of the problem with which this court is now confronted as being that the high court could not in the absence of adaptation make the appropriate order in accordance with s 74 that is to say an order issuing a warrant which authorised the continued enforcement of both components of the relevant sentence indeed he suggested that if the legal nature of the sentence is incompatible with the law of the state there must be either adaptation or refusal by the high court to issue a warrant to focus here on the warrant it was submitted is wrong rather the source of the problem is the nature of the sentence and the failure in 2006 to address it in the order of the high court 44 in general insofar as the issues which arise on these appeals are concerned i think those submissions in relation to the proper application of s 74 are correct again taking the example of mr rafferty as a matter of law the only jurisdiction the court had on 28th july 2006 by virtue of the operation of s 74 was to order the issuance of a warrant which would have the effect of authorising the continued enforcement of the sentence imposed in england and wales on mr rafferty in its legal nature and duration in the absence of an order adapting that sentence the high court had no jurisdiction to issue a warrant merely giving effect to part of the sentence that is to say authorising the detention of mr rafferty in prison in the state for a period equivalent to twothirds of the sentence imposed by the sentencing state while ignoring the remainder of the sentence that is to say the on licence in the community component 45 to purport to do so would be contrary to the provisions of s 7 to purport to do so would also be in contravention of the convention and in particular article 101 thereof which is a factor which in my view is of prime importance on the application of s 9 against that background i will consider the application of s 9 on the ministers motion to vary application of s 9 on the ministers motion to vary 46 insofar as they are applicable to the situation which arises here that is the detention of the respondents in the state under warrants issued under the amended act of 1995 the combined effect of subs 1 and 2 of s 9 is that  12 the learned high court judge discussed the difference between the power to adapt and the power to vary a warrant under the act of 1995 defect in the date of commencement of the sentence 13 a defect in the s 7 warrant was the date of the commencement of the sentence the high court took the view that this error could be corrected by the making of a variation order under s 91 of the 2005 act the learned trial judge stated that such a corrective order is akin to an order under the slip rule o 28 r 11 defect in the sentence 14 the defect in the sentence referred to was then addressed counsel for the state submitted that the sentence could be varied reflecting the nature of the english sentence as interpreted in sweeney v governor of loughan house open centre 2 ir 732 from a sentence of twenty eight years to one of eighteen years and eight months however the high court held decision 15 the issue for decision is whether the high court erred in holding that it did not have power to vary the warrant in relation to the defect in the sentence thus it is a question of the interpretation of the statute in particular the analysis of the power to vary the act of 1995 16 the act of 1995 enabled the state to ratify the council of europes convention on the transfer of sentenced persons 1983 which is referred to as the convention the convention was ratified by ireland on the 31st july 1995 and came into force on 1st november 1995 the purpose of the convention is to enable prisoners serve their sentences imposed abroad in their home state thus it is for the benefit of prisoners so that they may serve their sentences where the language and culture are their own and where they are near family and friends thus a sentenced person may be transferred pursuant to the convention only on the conditions inter alia i that the person is a national of the administering state ii that the person still has at least six months of the sentence to serve or it is indeterminate iv that the sentenced person consents to the transfer v that the acts or omissions for which the sentence was imposed would constitute an offence in the administering state and vi that the sentencing and administering states agree to the transfer adaption 17 section 7 of the act of 1995 was amended in the transfer of sentenced persons amendment act 1997 to make specific provision for the adaption of the sentence by the high court it provides 6 a the legal nature of a sentence adapted under paragraph a of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the legal nature of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either b the duration of a sentence adapted under paragraph b of subsection 5 of this section shall as far as practicable correspond to the duration of the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned and shall not in any event either i aggravate it or ii exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the state for a similar offence and vary 19 thus the issue then became and is now whether the warrants may be varied the high court analysed the difference between the power to adapt a warrant under s 7 and the power to vary under s 9 and concluded that the court did not have the power to vary the sentences on the warrants 20 section 9 of the act of 1995 provides 91 if at any time it appears to the minister appropriate in order that effect may be given to the provisions of the convention that a warrant under this act for the transfer of a person in or out of the state should be revoked or varied the minister may a in the case of a warrant under section 5 of this act and b in the case of a warrant under section 7 of this act this section has not been revisited by the oireachtas 21 this section applies at any time thus it is not limited as the adaption provision is to the initial process 22 under this section a court may make profound decisions a court may revoke a warrant it is thus a fundamental jurisdiction to exercise a power provided by the legislation 23 in the same section the court is given power to vary the provisions of a warrant it is thus aligned with another fundamental power and i consider it to be of an equal stature 24 in this section the court is given jurisdiction to revoke or vary the provisions of a warrant the procedure is protected by being provided for within the jurisdiction of the court being the administration of justice by a judge 25 further the jurisdiction given to the court is given in order that effect may be given to the provisions of the convention it follows that the section may be interpreted so as to give effect to the convention which is for the benefit of the prisoners it is clear that the court is given the power to vary warrants it may be presumed that this is to give effect to the operation of the transfer of prisoners in accordance with law 26 the provisions for adaption and revoking or varying are made for different times adaption is a provision which may be invoked initially the warrant for the transfer then enables the transfer of prisoners the fact that a different word is used for a jurisdiction and power at a different time reflects that it is occurring at a later time thus events may have occurred that require the revocation of a warrant which would not have occurred on the initial application similarly circumstances may arise which require an application to a court to vary a warrant the fundamental authority to imprison the prisoner the initial sentence was imposed by the sentencing state the warrants that follow are to enable the application of the convention this is administered by the state to which the prisoner wishes to transfer the terms adapt and vary relate to different times it is consistent with the convention that at both such times the warrant could be altered so as to give effect to the convention the act is premised on the grounds that it is to give effect to the provisions of the convention 27 the provisions of the act of 1995 enable the process of transferring a prisoner so as to give effect to the convention 28 i do not consider that the use of different words limits the power to vary the fact that the term adapt is used in relation to the initial process and the power to adapt a warrant does not reduce the power to vary it is entirely logical that the term adapt be used in relation to the initial processing of the warrant and that once that has occurred the legislation speaks of to vary the warrant 29 in its ordinary meaning the word vary is clear it is a departure from a former position the term vary means to change or to alter and this plain meaning is endorsed by the definitions from the dictionaries the word vary is defined in the concise oxford english dictionary tenth edition revised as a further clear indication from the actual text of the statute that where as here the sentence imposed by the foreign court is greater than the maximum penalty prescribed by our law in respect of the corresponding offence an adaptation order under s75 is requiredwhy else would s76a contain a prohibition of this nature governing the making of an adaptation order if the oireachtas had also thought that a change of this kind could be achieved by the making of a variation order under s91 if however this sentence is by its nature or duration incompatible with the law of the administering state or its law so requires that state may by a court or administrative order adapt the sanction to the punishment or measure prescribed by its own law for a similar offence as to its nature the punishment or measure shall as far as possible correspond with that imposed by the sentence to be enforced it shall not aggravate by its nature or duration the sanction imposed in the sentencing state nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering state 910 again this statement was made in the context of prisoners challenging their detention post conviction and trial the statements are however consistent here the prisoners must be taken to have been lawfully convicted after trial and appeal not only are the conviction appeal and sentence beyond challenge in these courts they are an essential building block of the prisoners entitlement to seek transfer to serve the english sentence in an irish prison where the regime permitting such transfer also contains a mechanism for variation of the warrant detaining the prisoners in an irish prison rather than an english jail if it contains a defect it cannot be said that the judge was wrong to permit the relevant state authorities to seek variation of the warrant so as to cure such a defect put in another way there may have been a defect or illegality attaching to the detention but it was not such a default of a fundamental requirement that the detention could be said to be wanting in due process of law so that the court had to proceed immediately to release the prisoners without considering the question of whether the defect or illegality attaching to the detention could be cured under the statutory regime providing for their detention finally it could be said that this is consistent with the result and approach of this court in sweeney even if the matter was not the subject of detailed consideration the court and the relevant applicant appear to have considered that the detention of the applicant was not fundamentally flawed until such time as mr sweeney was detained in an irish prison at a point by which he would have been released in england in the particular circumstances of these cases therefore we agree that the high court was entitled to take the step of not proceeding to make a final order under article 404 until it had the opportunity to consider an application for variation under s9 which application in the light of this judgment ought to have succeeded 911 accordingly we would order that the warrant here be varied to provide for imprisonment for a period of days calculated by 18 years and 8 months less the period served in england and that period served in ireland plus remission earned in this jurisdiction this would result in a significant reduction in time served and avoidance of release on strict terms which would have been the case if the prisoners had served their sentence in the uk 912 finally while the provisions of the 1995 act as amended may be superseded in relation to countries who are members of the european union and subject to the provisions of the framework decision of 2008909jha and it is not apparent that this has been separately implemented in irish law the 1995 act will remain of importance in relation to transfers to or from to countries which are not subject to the framework decision or those countries who rely on the convention and any implementing legislation as compliance with the framework decision and to transfers between european union countries which predate the coming in to force of the framework decision the convention does not appear to have given rise to legal difficulties in most of the other convention states the purpose of the 1995 act and the convention is essentially humanitarian and seeks to pursue the rehabilitative object of permitting prisoners to serve their sentence in an environment which is both more familiar and permits more ready interaction with their family and friends hitherto it may not have been thought to be in the interests of such prisoners to challenge the regime which allows for such transfers however one of the likely consequences of these proceedings will be to slow up if not indeed to halt such transfers to ireland if sentencing states cannot be confident that the sentences will be enforced it is clear therefore that the terms of the 1995 act may require revision in that regard it may be appropriate to point out that while s71 clearly contemplates that any adaptation must take place on the initial application for transfer that limitation does not seem to be required by the convention furthermore the decision in sweeney necessarily involved the irish courts in the uncomfortable exercise of analysing and seeking to determine the essential legal nature of a sentence imposed in another jurisdiction under the convention it is contemplated by article 101 that in the case of continued enforcement the administering state shall be bound by the legal nature and duration of the sentence as determined by the sentencing state the convention also provides for the exchange of information from the administering state to the sentencing state which would include a statement of legal nature and duration of the sentence 913 in principle therefore any statutory regime for enforcing the convention should make a similar provision so that disputes as to the correct legal nature and effect of a sentence should have to be brought and determined in the courts of the sentencing state here the fundamental problem arose because of the dichotomy between the sentence as announced in the court and the provisions of uk statute law as to the meaning of such a sentence together with the manner in which such a sentence should be recorded for the purposes of a transfer such matters should clearly be resolved in the courts of the sentencing state and perhaps in circumstances where all parties know and are bound by the determination 914 finally there are some comments in sweeney which might suggest that a sentence for the purpose of the act only means a sentence of imprisonment while this did not arise for decision in sweeney it is perhaps important to point out that sentences which involve terms of imprisonment and a term of supervised release are not excluded from the convention or the 1995 act what is required is that the sentence contains a current custodial element and in the words of the convention be a punishment or measure involving deprivation of liberty if the sentence has some component of direct deprivation of liberty then it appears to come within the convention even though there may also be an element of suspension on terms such a sentence may be continued in ireland under the terms of the act if it is compatible with irish law and with the irish sentencing and probation regime and if not it may be adapted into terms which are we address these matters as it is desirable that the convention and any replacement provision should operate in irish law to provide for a clear and smooth transfer of prisoners to and from ireland it is in the long term interests of all irish prisoners abroad and their families as well as in the public interest that the regime under the 1995 act should have clear and effective application on the ground rather than give rise to complex and protracted litigation in courts bailii

the state in appeal over the release of dissident republicans 14 jul 2016 reading time 4 minutes about this case judgmentexternal link fintan ofarrell declan rafferty and michael mcdonald all from louth had travelled to slovakia in 2001 for the purposes of purchasing very substantial quantities of arms and explosives for an organisation styling itself the irish republican army or real ira in 2002 all three respondents pleaded guilty before the english courts to terrorist offences including conspiracy to cause explosions they were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 30 years later reduced on appeal to 28 years and commenced serving their prison terms in england in 2006 they availed of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 1995 to 1997 two statutes were enacted by the oireachtas to allow irish prisoners in other jurisdictions to be transferred to serve out their sentences in irish prisons an application was made to the high court in 2006 for warrants to allow each respondent to be transferred to custody in ireland to be detained in portlaoise prison to serve the balance of their sentences the sentencing system which operates in england and wales is appreciably different from that which obtains under irish law having regard to the relevant english law the three men would automatically have been entitled to release on licence following completion of twothirds of their sentences ie 18 years and eight months the irish system does not allow for release on licence but provides for onequarter remission the significance of these differences between the two sentencing regimes was at the heart of the supreme courts decision in sweeney v governor of loughan house open centre iesc 42 as a result of the decision in sweeney on the 19th june 2014 justice hogan in the high court directed an inquiry into the legality of the trios detention in portlaoise prison under the 2006 warrants applying the principles identified in sweeney under article 404 of the constitution justice hogan was obligated to enquire into the complaint that the prisoners were being unlawfully detained the application to the high court was accompanied by a challenge to the constitutionality of section 7 of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 19951997 in two judgments consequent on the inquiry in august and september 2014 justice hogan held the detention of the respondents was not in accordance with law and directed their release in light of the conclusions reached on the article 404 enquiry justice hogan did not consider it necessary to proceed with the constitutional challenge appealing justice hogans decision to release the men the states appeal concerned the warrants issued pursuant to section 7 of the transfer of sentenced persons acts 19951997 the warrants the sentencing judge in england had indicated the sentences should take effect from the 5th july 2001 the date of the slovakian arrests  whereas the warrants issued pursuant to section 7 of the acts of 1995 to 1997 stated that the commencement date of the sentences was 7th may 2002 in addition the warrant included the recorded sentence of 28 years imprisonment for conspiracy to cause explosions in the high court it was found that the warrant incorrectly recorded that the sentence imposed was of 28 years and were to that extent defective the objective reality of the sentences should have had a true duration of approximately 18 years and 8 months and that this term should have been recited in the warrant the question before the supreme court was whether pursuant to section 9 of the 1995 transfer of sentenced persons act the court could vary the 2006 warrant issued by the high court under section 7 of the act so that the sentence imposed by the english courts could lawfully be modified all seven judges in the supreme court agreed the detention warrants were defective and that the sentences in those warrants could not be retrospectively adapted under section 7 of the transfer of sentenced persons act however they disagreed whether the sentences could be varied under section 9 of the act the majority comprised judges mckechnie macmenamin laffoy and omalley while the minority comprised chief justice denham and judges clarke and odonnell in dismissing the appeals justice macmenamin concluded that the process whereby the respondents were placed in detention in ireland was fundamentally defective and the warrants were void ab initio neither section 9 of the act nor the inherent jurisdiction of the court can be invoked to cure the jurisdictional deficiencies fundamental in these cases by rÃ³ise connolly for irish legal news subscribe 353 1695 0328 newsdeskirishlegalcom news appointments universities financial regulatory climate and finally
