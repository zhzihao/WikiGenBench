Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman returned as hosts, while Janette Manrara returned to host Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, alongside Fleur East, who was announced as the new co-host after Rylan Clark's departure in April 2023. In April 2023, the BBC announced that Shirley Ballas, Anton Du Beke, Motsi Mabuse, and Craig Revel Horwood would return to the judging panel.\n\nFormat \n\nThe couples dance each week in a live show. The judges score each performance out of ten. The couples are then ranked according to the judges' scores and given points according to their rank, with the lowest scored couple receiving one point, and the highest scored couple receiving the most points (the maximum number of points available depends on the number of couples remaining in the competition). The public are also invited to vote for their favourite couples, and the couples are ranked again according to the number of votes they receive, again receiving points; the couple with the fewest votes receiving one point, and the couple with the most votes receiving the most points.\n\nThe points for judges' score and public vote are then added together, and the two couples with the fewest points are placed in the bottom two. If two couples have equal points, the points from the public vote are given precedence. As with the previous series, the bottom two couples have to perform a dance-off on the results show. Based on that performance alone, each judge then votes on which couple should stay and which couple should leave, with Shirley Ballas, as head judge, having the last and deciding vote if needed.\n\nProfessional dancers \nIn April 2023, the BBC announced that Dianne Buswell, Nadiya Bychkova, Vito Coppola, Graziano Di Prima, Amy Dowden, Carlos Gu, Karen Hauer, Katya Jones, Neil Jones, Nikita Kuzmin, Gorka Márquez, Luba Mushtuk, Lauren Oakley, Giovanni Pernice, Jowita Przystał, Johannes Radebe, Michelle Tsiakkas, Kai Widdrington, and Nancy Xu would be returning to the series. The only professional dancer who did not return was Cameron Lombard, who had been part of the professional group routines since the nineteenth series.\n\nIn May 2023, Dowden announced she had been diagnosed with grade III breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy, but added she was \"determined\" to get back on the dance floor and that she was hoping to take part in the series if she was able to. Despite her initial plans to return for the series, Dowden confirmed in July that she had been diagnosed with \"another type of cancer\" and would be unable to partner a celebrity due to undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nDuring the launch show, Lauren Oakley received a celebrity partner for the first time, while Neil Jones, Nadiya Bychkova, and Michelle Tsiakkas did not receive a partner. The rest of the pros were paired to a celebrity, including Luba Mushtuk, who did not have a celebrity partner for the last two series.\n\nCouples\nThis series features fifteen celebrity contestants. On 4 August 2023, the first three celebrities announced as participants in the series were Amanda Abbington, Angela Rippon, and Layton Williams. Celebrity contestants continued to be revealed until 11 August 2023, when the full line-up was announced.\n\nOn 23 October, it was announced that Amanda Abbington had withdrawn from the competition after having missed the previous week.\n\nScoring chart\nThe highest score each week is indicated in  with a dagger (), while the lowest score each week is indicated in  with a double-dagger ().\n\nColour key:\n\nNotes\n\nAverage chart\nThis table only counts for dances scored on a traditional 40-point scale.\n\nWeekly scores\nUnless indicated otherwise, individual judges scores in the charts below (given in parentheses) are listed in this order from left to right: Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Shirley Ballas, Anton Du Beke.\n\nLaunch show\n\nMusical guest: Jessie Ware — \"Free Yourself\"\n\nWeek 1\nThere was no elimination this week; all scores carried over to the following week.

made a ton of mistakesdu beke also gave a bonkers 9 to thomass backstreet boys couples choice  which wasnt even that good in its own terms as a juvenile copycat street dance thomas didnt remotely match his partner for impact groove or grounded delivery let alone as a competitive dance on a ballroom showperhaps he means well but du beke is doing a disservice to this talented cast  and to
