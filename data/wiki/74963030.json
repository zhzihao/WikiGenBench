It was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's NXT brand division. Unlike the previous year, which was held as a livestreaming event, the 2023 event returned NXT Halloween Havoc to being a television special like the 2020 and 2021 events. The 2023 event, however, was expanded to a two-part special episode of NXT on the USA Network, taking place on October 24 and 31, 2023, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. SmackDown wrestlers Shotzi and Scarlett served as the hosts of the event, marking Shotzi's third time hosting the event, after 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe card comprised a total of 16 matches. Thirteen of these matches were televised, with seven on the first night and six on the second, as well as three dark matches, with one on the first night and two on the second night. In the main event of Night 1, Lyra Valkyria defeated Becky Lynch to win the NXT Women's Championship. In another prominent match, Chase University (Andre Chase and Duke Hudson) defeated The Family (Tony D'Angelo and Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo) to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. Night 1 was also notable for the in-ring debut of Lexis King (formerly known as Brian Pillman Jr. in All Elite Wrestling). In the main event of Night 2, Ilja Dragunov defeated Carmelo Hayes to retain the NXT Championship. In other prominent matches, \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio defeated Nathan Frazer to retain the NXT North American Championship and Bron Breakker defeated Mr. Stone. Rock band New Years Day also performed their songs, \"Vampyre\" and \"Hurts like hell\", to open both Night 1 and 2.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground \nHalloween Havoc is a professional wrestling event currently produced by WWE. As the name implies, it is a Halloween-themed show held in October. It was originally produced as an annual pay-per-view (PPV) by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from 1989 until 2000 as WWE purchased WCW in 2001. The 2000 event was the final Halloween Havoc until WWE revived the show as an annual event for their developmental brand NXT in 2020. The 2020 and 2021 events were held as television specials of the NXT program on the USA Network, but for 2022, it was held as a livestreaming event.\n\nAt NXT No Mercy on September 30, 2023, it was announced that NXT Halloween Havoc would return as a television special, but expanded to a two-part special of NXT on the USA Network. The fourth annual NXT Halloween Havoc, and 16th Halloween Havoc overall, was scheduled to take place on October 24 and 31, 2023, at NXT's home base, the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. SmackDown wrestlers Shotzi and Scarlett served as the hosts of the event—Shotzi previously served as host of the 2020 and 2022 events, and in 2023, she and Scarlett began hosting a paranormal series on WWE's YouTube channel called Chamber of Horrors. It was also announced that the rock band New Years Day would perform their song, \"Vampyre\", at the event, which was the theme song of the two-part show.\n\nStorylines \nThe card included 13 televised matches, with seven on the first night and six on the second, that resulted from scripted storylines. There were also three dark matches, with one held the first night and two the second. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television program, NXT, and the supplementary online streaming show, Level Up.\n\nOn the October 3 episode of NXT, Lyra Valkyria defeated Roxanne Perez and Indi Hartwell in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for Becky Lynch's NXT Women's Championship during Week 1 of Halloween Havoc.\n\nOn the October 10 episode of NXT, NXT Tag Team Champions The Family (Tony D'Angelo and Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo) proposed to guest NXT General Manager Cody Rhodes to set up a tag team battle royal where the last two remaining teams will compete in a standard tag team match to determine a number one contender for their titles during Week 1 of Halloween Havoc. Rhodes accepted the proposal and called this match the Bada Bing Bada Boom Battle Royal. The following week, the Battle Royal was won by Chase University (Andre Chase and Duke Hudson).\n\nOn the October 10 episode of NXT, guest NXT General Manager Cody Rhodes announced a triple threat match between Baron Corbin, Dijak, and the winner of Carmelo Hayes vs. Bron Breakker to determine the number one contender for Ilja Dragunov's NXT Championship at Halloween Havoc. Later that night, Hayes defeated Breakker to be added to the match. The following week, the triple threat match was won by Hayes.\n\nOn the September 5 episode of NXT, during Gigi Dolin's match against Thea Hail, Dolin was attacked by Blair Davenport, costing her the match. The following week, Dolin and Davenport engaged in a brawl backstage. Two weeks later, a scheduled match between Dolin and Davenport never occurred after Davenport attacked Dolin backstage. At the NXT No Mercy pre-show, after Davenport defeated Kelani Jordan, she was attacked by Dolin, and a match between them was set up for following episode of NXT, where Dolin won. After the match, Davenport choked the referee and yelled that her feud with Dolin was not over. Two weeks later, Davenport challenged Dolin to a match at Halloween Havoc, which Dolin accepted. Later that night, Dolin unveiled the Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal Wheel, and spun the wheel with it landing on a Lights Out match, which was later made official.\n\nOn the September 5 episode of NXT, Lyra Valkyria and Roxanne Perez were chatting in the locker room before being interrupted by Kiana James, where Perez hit her with a forearm to start a brawl. On the October 3 episode of NXT, during a triple threat match to become the number one contender for NXT Women's Championship, James pulled Perez to ringside, costing both James and Perez the match. The following week, James tried to attack Perez after her match with Asuka, but Shotzi appeared and attacked James. On the October 17 episode of NXT, Perez distracted James during her match with Shotzi, costing her the match. Later that night, a Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal match was announced between Perez and James, where Perez spun the wheel and it landed on Devil's Playground Match.\n\nThe NXT Women's Breakout Tournament is a tournament composed of eight female wrestlers from the NXT brand. The tournament began on the October 3 episode of NXT. The winner earns a contract and can cash-in for a NXT Women's Championship match at any time.\n\nOn the September 5 episode of NXT, Bron Breakker severely injured Von Wagner after crushing his skull with steel steps. At NXT No Mercy, Wagner's manager, Mr. Stone interfered in Breakker's match against Baron Corbin, ultimately costing him the match. On the October 17 episode of NXT, Mr. Stone stated that Wagner has a long way to go in his recovery and took issue with Breakker's lack of remorse. Mr. Stone challenged Breakker to a match at Halloween Havoc, which was later made official.\n\nOn the October 17 episode of NXT, Fallon Henley was giving advice to competitors in the NXT Women's Breakout Tournament before being interrupted by Tiffany Stratton, who mentioned she defeated Henley to advance to the finals in the previous year's tournament. The following week on Week 1 of Halloween Havoc, Henley cosplayed as Stratton and mocked her which lead to a brawl between the two. A match between Henley and Stratton was scheduled for Week 2 of Halloween Havoc.\n\nOn the October 17 episode of NXT, The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed) and Angel Garza and Humberto Carrillo competed in the Bada Bing Bada Boom Battle Royal. Garza and Carrillo eliminated the Creed Brothers before the latter cost them the match. The following week, the Creed Brothers asked for a match against Garza and Carrillo and spun the Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal wheel, landing on a Tables, Ladders, and Scares match.\n\nIn a digital exclusive on the October 16 episode of Raw, \"Dirty\" Dominik Mysterio interrupted an interview with Nathan Frazer, who wanted a match for the NXT North American Championship, but Mysterio declined, saying Frazer didn't deserve a title match. A brawl then ensued between Mysterio and Frazer. The next night on NXT, Mysterio and Frazer brawled again before Rhea Ripley, Mysterio's Judgment Day stablemate came to his defense. A title match between Mysterio and Frazer was later scheduled for Week 2 of Halloween Havoc.\n\nOn Week 1 of Halloween Havoc, Chase University (Andre Chase, Duke Hudson, Thea Hail, and Jacy Jayne) were celebrating Chase and Hudson winning the NXT Tag Team Championship before Chelsea Green and Piper Niven took issue with their loud voices. Green threatened to file a formal complaint and asked to be directed to Shawn Michaels's office. Hail and Jayne offered to take them there and ask for a match for the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against Green and Niven, which was scheduled for Week 2 of Halloween Havoc.\n\nResults\n\nNXT Women's Breakout Tournament\n\nSee also\n\n2023 in professional wrestling\nList of WWE NXT special episodes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2023 in professional wrestling in Florida\n2023 in professional wrestling\nEvents in Orlando, Florida\nHalloween Havoc\nOctober 2023 events in the United States\nProfessional wrestling in Orlando, Florida\nHolidays themed professional wrestling shows\nWWE NXT", "unikey": "NXT Halloween Havoc (2023)", "summary": "The 2023 NXT Halloween Havoc was the fourth annual Halloween Havoc professional wrestling event produced by WWE, and 16th Halloween Havoc event overall.

and the meta four were in the vip lounge seating vic joseph assumed it was oceans eleven themed they were dressed fancy with noam holding money bags no time limit for this match 1 butch vs joe coffey wmark coffey wolfgang in the finals of the global heritage invitationalbutch started off with a slap right to joes face this led to a you got butch slapped chant from the crowd which vic joseph acknowledged vic also noted that butch pete dunne vs joe coffey was the first nxt uk takeover main event butch then hit coffey with his usual joint manipulation into an elbow stomp joe recovered and used an armbar to grind his knee into butchs face butch used a kip up to get back to his feet for a separation joe slammed butch to the mat and softened up butch with knees to the chest joe took down butch with a running gallus pose butch slammed joe to the mat with an armbar and mocked the gallus pose butch gave joe another elbow stomp butch then gave joes elbow a double stomp butch put joe in an armbar mark coffey distracted the referee which allowed wolfgang to break the hold by punching butch joe went for a springboard crossbody but he was punched out of the air by butchs right hand joe went to regroup with gallus gallus got wiped out by a triangle moonsault back in the ring butch hit joe with a snap german hand stump and buzzsaw kick wolfgang and mark tried to interfere again but were ejected by the referee heading into pictureinpicture during the pictureinpicture commercial break joe and butch were trading ora ora ora punches back from break butch set up and hit joe coffey with about 20 beats of the bodhran butch then gave joe a ddt on the apron coffey recovered and gave butch some fatigued right hands and a springboard crossbody joes arm gave out on him when he when for a german suplex joe then fought through and gave butch a german while selling the arm pain joe hit hit butch with a flying knife edge strike butch hit joe with an eznguiri and joe stumbled into a

joe turned butch inside out with a discus lariat butch kicked out of joes finisher joe went for another flying knife strike at ringside but flew into the steel steps back in the ring butch nailed joe with the bitter end for the clean win butch defeated joe coffey via pinfall in 1242 to win the global heritage invitational tournament butch yelled at the meta four at a distance while vic joseph plugged no mercy tickets johns thoughts decent enough match with the most logical result noam dars a heel and everyone expected a babyface out of group a to be the one going to face him wwe did a good job making butch bate and axiom feel all like contenders i only wished they gave them about 5 more minutes as vic noted butch vs joe coffey was the first nxt uk takeover main event and that one had a lot more drama throughout the match go out of your way to see that if you have time now the question is will another main roster star in butch pick up an nxt title mckenzie mitchell interviewed dominik mysterio about his recent win against dragon lee last night dom noted that since he took care of dragon lee he has a free saturday he said now he can rest at home with mami on a couch eating chicken tendies mckenzie mitchell informed dom that shawn michaels announced a triple threat for this weeks show to find doms opponent for no mercy due to mustafa ali being released from his wwe contract dom said what mckenzie showed doms hbks twitter which announced axiom vs tyler bate vs dragon lee for the title shot dom ranted about hbk and adam pierce always trying to screw him over trick williams made his entrance to his new theme which allowed the crowd to chant whoop dat trick to the cadence of the song tony dangelo and channing stacks lorenzo were eating food at an italian restaurant with their nxt tag team title belts on the table they met up with angel garza and humberto carrillo tony said they had a 6 course dinner coming humberto said they came for the tag titles stacks noted that the rest of the tag teams will be joining them for dinner joe gacy and ava made their entrance 2 trick williams vs joe gacy wava both men ran the ropes with trick getting the upper hand with a shoulder tackle trick hit joe with a body slam and dropkick trick hit joe with a right hand uppercut combo joe came back with a knee and ddt joe got trick on rear mount and gave him forearms to the back of the neck joe then put trick in a crossface trick got to his feet but was immediately slammed to the mat trick dodged an elbow drop and gave joe a boot trick gave joe another right hand combo trick gave joe a side crescent kick joe came back with a back elbow trick reversed joes lariat finisher with a shoulder tackle for the win trick williams defeated joe coffey via pinfall in 226 booker was vibing to tricks theme kelly kincaid congratulated trick after the match for his victory trick noted that hes ambidextrous and can whoop ass with both hands kelly asked trick for a prediction for the melo vs ilja match at no mercy trick said lets not talk about this someone elses match but rather tricks biggest win yet trick then talked about how hard ilja hits and said he will be a fool to bet against him and him is carmelo hayes trick said trick melo gang will always be here trick said while melo already has a championship its about time i get mine johns thoughts simple stepping stone match for trick williams whos on the comeup im actually a fan of nonfinisher finishes as they do catch the viewer off guard and prove that a person can pluck out a win out of nowhere trick is still developing but hes developing smoothly and steadily the guy is already top tier in terms of look and voice hes athletic and smooth enough to get that inring up there in no time i like that theyre also turning his singles development into a storyline that takes the crowd along with him on his journey if they do break up trick melo gang maybe melos the one that turns heel maybe mckenzie mitchell interviewed blair davenport blair called gigi dolins last attack feeble blair said that imitation is the best form of flattery but gigis imitation was pathetic blair said when she sneak attacks people they dont come back blair told gigi to watch what she does tonight burn the ships baron corbin made his entrance andre chase and duke hudson walked into jacy jayne and were looking for thea hail jacy introduced the new thea hail who wore new leather clothes that showed skin duke said holy shit chase was about to disapprove but then faked saying that the clothes looked good hail said jacy turned her into a grown ass woman and shes looking forward to her match against dani palmer jacy jayne hyped up thea debuting new ring gear too josh briggs brooks jensen and fallon henley made their entrance 3 josh briggs wbrooks jensen fallon henley vs baron corbin briggs dumped corbin to ringside with a clothesline josh then tossed corbin around at ringside briggs then gave corbin a nice looking big boot corbin used a sweep kick and chokeslam on briggs for a two count briggs came back with a chokeslam and splash for a two count briggs staggered corbin with a yakuza kick corbin pulled the referee in as a human shield corbin gave briggs a diving strike and an end of days for the victory baron corbin defeated josh briggs via pinfall in 301 corbin took a mic and hyped up his match against bron breakker on saturday he said well find out if bron will break or bite bron breakker made his entrance wearing all black and an underarmor shirt bron teased talking but instead gave corbin a right hand developmental security ran out for a pull apart brawl vic then hyped up the becky lynch vs tiffany stratton preview for after the break johns thoughts a short match to give corbin a win heading into his no mercy match but i thought josh briggs really made the most of the three minutes briggs dominated 80 of the match and it was just corbin coming out of nowhere with the ref shield and end of days briggs is someone i hope gets a chance as a strong singles wrestler down the road he looks a legit 68 and hes great in the ring briggs is someone who has that kane or undertaker type of skillset that can be very valuable to wwe if they want to go that direction trick williams knocked on hbks office door hbks voice then welcomed trick into the office vic joseph thanked the band ryan oakes and loveless for providing the song heavyweight as the theme for no mercy vic then sent the show to a becky lynch vs tiffany stratton no mercy hyped package hank walker and tank ledger were in the middle of their entrance lucien price bronco lima and scrypts got their full televised entrance their entrance was grand theft auto san andreas themed booker asked vic wheres the beef and said here it is 4 bronco lima and lucien price wscrypts vs hank walker and tank ledger hank tossed around price early on hank and tank used tags to swarm lucien with agile power moves lima got a cheap shot on tank off the distraction bronco hit tank with a running big chest boot bronco then hit tank with a reverse bronco buster on the 2nd rope price tagged in and gave tank a corner lariat tank staggered lima and tagged in hank who cleaned house hank gave lima a stinger splash and snake eyes hank gave lima a bicycle boot scrypts distracted hank which distracted tank lima tagged in and hit tank with an assisted alabama slam for the victory lucien price and bronco lima defeated tank ledger and hank walker via pinfall in 248 vic noted that lima and prices catchphrase is out tha mud gigi dolin was warming up backstage the lights went out and she was jumped by blair davenport blair called gigi pathetic johns thoughts good win for lima and price i hope we see a lot of these big ol dudes because theyve really impressed me with their work on nxt level up yes theyre grand theft auto san andreas themed but that was one hell of a good game they have this really inglewood vibe about them too which im a bit biased because it reminds me of home as per the promo recently scrypts is starting to really fit in well with them too as i also mentioned before he does give them legit street cred because scrypts was a real life crip gangsta east coast crip but all the same vic joseph hyped up elimination chamber in australia joseph noted that former nxt stars indi hartwell grayson waller and rhea ripley were from australia back at the italian restaurant stacks asked carrillo and garza why it looks like their chest were mauled by a sabertooth tiger garza and carrillo then flashed their painted own claw marks eddie edwards and davey richards would be proud garza told them not to disrespect their grandfather carrillo said they have those tattoos as a reminder of who they are which their grandfather left on their chest garza said that message equals winning the tag team titles tony d said itll be a while before they give him a return message julius creed and brutus creed joined the dinner tony d said they ordered extra spicy meatballs for them brutus said he heard that this was the restaurant where someone died of food poisoning which scared carrillo before he ate tony d said that was the italian restaurant down the street the dinner ensued johns thoughts oh no dont tell me humberto and angel are going to wrestle with those stupid claw tattoos on their chest they were distracting when eddie edwads and davey richards wore them as the american wolves and itll be distracting now axiom and tyler bate were backstage in the locker room bate said no hard feelings axiom accepted trick williams showed up and informed axiom and bate that hbk inserted him into the match to turn it into a fatal four way entrances for the strap match took place 5 eddy thorpe vs dijak in a strap match dijak tried to drag eddy to ringside but eddy used the strap to drag dijak into the ringpost eddy gave dijak a suicide dive dijak came back by yanking eddy into the apron eddy then used the strap to trip up eddy dijak went high but eddy pulled him with the strap and gave him an enzuigiri eddys family was shown in the crowd vic noted that dijak was wearing the belt that he beat up eddys tree with dijak dodged a yakuza kick and then lashed eddy in the back with the strap eddy was tossed to ringside heading into break dijak fishhooked eddys mouth with the strap and taunted eddy thorpe and eddys family eddy got to his feet both men paintbrushed each other with slaps eddy gave dijak a back kick eddy and dijak took each other out ot ringside dijak landed on his feet with eddy in his hand dijak gave eddy a chokeslam on the apron eddys family yelled at dijak eddies niece and maybe mother were yelling at dijak eddys niece was crying and told eddy to get up as dijak smacked him with the strap vic clarified that it was his mom dad eddy powered up and gave dijak lashes eddy went to town on dijak eddy hit dijak in the face with the strap too eddy wrapped the belt on his fist and punched dijak eddy thorpe gave dijak an elbow drop for the victory eddy thorpe defeated dijak via pinfall in 1009 eddys niece was shown happy that her uncle won dijak recovered and gave eddy a feast your eyes dijaks face was bruised from a strap shot earlier dijak put eddy on the top rope and superkicked him into a tree of woe dijak used the strap to trap him in the tree of woe dijak took the belt and beat up eddy like he beat up eddys tree jacy jayne was outside of thea hails locker room acting super hyped about theas new ring gear johns thoughts a good strap match that got more violent then most wwe pg matches no blood but those lashes looked brutal big assist goes to dijaks mom and niece i believe his family either lives in reno or san francisco so they made the trip all the way out there the dad and sister didnt really sell but the mom was great in getting all angrymad at dijak the niece was great throughout selling fear when eddy was losing and showing relief when eddy won these wrestler family members are doing a great job these days adding to the stories of their wrestler counterparts dani palmer made her entrance first vic joseph and booker t checked in on commentary vic was about to announce that gigi dolin wasnt able to compete tonight but had his headset taken away by blair davenport who promised that the next time she sees gigi it would be much worse booker told vic that he just got manhandled by blair thea hail and jacy jayne made their entrance thea has new ring gear and music the ring gear is leather and black with lingerie straps her new theme music is rock themed i think shes using jody threats current impact wrestling theme im pretty sure that it is because i review that show too and hear that theme most weeks 6 thea hail wjacy jayne vs dani palmer dani got thea with a side headlock takedown dani got a armdrag in palmer hit hail with a huracanrana hail came back with a huracanrana of her own hail put dani in an armbar hail gave dani a enzuigiri and exploder suplex for a two count dani came back with a front dropkick and handstand kick hail avoided a corkscrew moonsault and put dani in a kimura for the win thea hail defeated dani palmer via submission in 222 duke hudson and andre chase looked disappointed at the crows nest watching hails change johns thoughts solid makeover for thea hail whos getting a chance to show off a heel side to herself what works here is nxt took their time hyping up this transformation so it worked well in that sense dani palmer looked solid showing off some of her athleticism in this match and shes someone to look out for as for theas theme its actually pretty good but i looked it up and yes its jody threats entrance music on impact its royalty free i get it but maybe wwe might want to change that because threat had it first trick williams was hyped up with carmelo hayes backstage trick was more hyped then melo who was distracted by his phone trick asked melo what was up melo said hes busy with the contract signing and everything trick said he can handle his own business after trick left melo looked a bit remorseful at not paying attention to trick dragon lee made his entrance an interviewer tried to interview baron corbin who shut her up bron breakker then jumped corbin another pullapart ensued axiom was in the middle of his entrance back to the ring bate and trick made their entrance during the break 7 axiom vs dragon lee vs tyler bate vs trick williams to become number one contender to the north american championship axiom and bate dumped trick to ringside bate hit trick with a plancha axiom and dragon traded lucha moves axiom caught dragon with a jump kick axoiom took down trick with a rough looking trust fall dragon hit all three opponents with a tope con hilo trick reversed a power bomb into a boston crab bate put dragon in a armbar at the same time axiom put trick in a sleeper at the same time bate broke up the sleeper and his own hold with a chop to axiom dragon reversed bop and bang with a bang bate hit dragon with a dropkick trick hit bate with a big boot trick hit axiom with a punch and took out dragon with a lariat trick hit bate and axiom with a double flapjack the show went to picture in picture axiom caught bate with a half and half suplex axiom hit trick and dragon at the same time with a huracanrana and armdrag axiom got a two count on bate after a strike dragon caught axiom with a slingshot boot dragon hit axiom and trick with hesitation dropkick dragon hit bate with a sitout power bomb for a nearfall bate broke up dragons pin trick dumped dragon to ringside trick caught a diving axiom with an uppercut trick hit bate with a body slam trick then gave dragon and bate a double book end for the nearfall on both men vic joked that some call it a double rock bottom booker said why you gotta go there bate reversed tricks suplex into a ddt bate lifted up dragon and grabbed axiom he hit both opponents with a helicopter spin and giant spin bate press slammed dragon on axiom and hit dragon with a deadlift german axiom broke up bates pin on trick axiom hit dragon with a canadian destroyer bate hit axiom with bop and bam trick hit bate with a uppercut everyone traded strikes dragon was the last man standing to hit axiom with a superkick bate caught dragon with a gamengiri axiom hit dragon with a super spanish fly dragon kicked out a holy shit chant ensued lading to the sensors kicking in dragon hit axiom with destino dragon headbutted trick but stumbled into bates head to knock himself out trick fell on axiom for the win trick williams defeated dragon lee tyler bate and axiom via pinfall in 1059 trick celebrated the win like it was the biggest win of his career highlights form the match aired johns thoughts a really hectic and fun four way match where everyone looked good and was protected coming out of it that headbutt sequence was tricky but it worked out to keep bate axiom and dragon looking strong props to dragon for taking jobs two nights in a row and looking good coming out trick hung in there with a bunch of wrestlers with decades of wrestling experience he didnt have to be to fancy and it really fits into his whole plucky storyline on top of that he passed the test of not being gassed after two matches back at the italian restaurant price scrypts and lima joined the dinner tony joked that scrypts needs a booster seat price said not to disrespect his mans like that scrypts said its ok because he brought cheese for the rats lima said hes not here to break bread brutus said he really liked the ketchup bread they all then wondered which team gets the title shot at no mercy brutus meanwhile wanted more chicken because the food was better then his mom each team then said they should face tony d and stacks price threatened that this place bout to get dirty real quick tony d called in security stack said everyone makes a good case tony d said he doesnt want their first ple defense look easy tony said theyll face all the teams and if they disagree they can leave they all stayed they then all did a toast mckenzie mitchell interviewed dominik mysterio about facing trick on saturday at no mercy dom said that hbk threw him a curveball but hes going to whoop that trick like he did to dragon lee the prior night dragon lee then ran in and punched dom out dragon was dragged away by referees trick williams caught up with melo backstage to share a dap melo said he and trick are about to leave no mercy both as champs trick told melo go go handle his thing a vignette aired for an unseen person he was watching wcw saturday night an old cincinnati bengals game and an old newscast on an old crt television update as one of the commentators on the free side pointed out this is probably a brian pillman jr vignette pillman sr being from ohio and a former linebacker for the bengals being the giveaway that on top of the vignette being legacy themed vic joseph ran through the advertised nxt no mercy card ilja dragunov and carmelo hayes made their entrance for the nxt championship contract signing there was no moderator one thing i did notice is that ilja wasnt wearing his red contacts melo took the mic first and said there is nothing to talk about and should just sign the contract ilja said that hes convinced that melo is the wrong man for the nxt championship melo talked about how he didnt plan that spot last time where ilja put his face into the title but at no mercy hell prove once and for all that he can beat ilja ilja said that he can see that melo struggles outside of his comfort zone he said melo will witness unbearable pain from the dragon melo cut off ilja and said that ilja is buying into his own hype that he didnt lose to melo at great american bash ilja said the crowd and melo know that melo didnt truly win ilja then asked melo what will melo do when he throws everything at ilja and ilja doesnt stay down and if melo shoots and misses ilja asked if melo can answer those questions melo said the reality is being nxt champion is not how much pain you can endure how man veins you can pop out of your head its about being undeniable its about being him melo said hes not like iljas past opponents like wes lee oro mensah and trick williams melo stuttered saying his best friends name melo said hell push ilja to his limits because hes nxt champ for a reason ilja signed the contract first ilja told melo that you cant do nothing because you cant do nothing huh ilja said melo wont forget saturday for the rest of his life ilja said then melo will realize that his dynasty has fallen ilja said long live the tzar melo signed the contract melo got in iljas face and told ilja that the nxt championship if bigger than both he and ilja melo said for him the title is a beacon of hope for those that look like melo for anyone that shot their shot and prayed it went in he said he knows ilja can carry the responsibility as champion but ilja cant do it better than carmelo hayes melo and ilja then had a faceoff to end the segment vic joseph and booker t checked in on commentary vic announced that dragon lee will be the special guest referee for the dominik mysterio vs trick williams match vic then sent the show to the nxt parking lot where bron breakker and baron corbins pullapart brawl was still going on bron had the upper hand but then corbin sidestepped a spear to send bron into an open car door the brawl continued bron gave corbin a spinebuster on the hood of a van corbin came back with a low blow corbin chokeslammed bron on the top of the van bron nosold the chokeslam and the brawl ensued the brawl spilled back inside of the hallway of the performance center bron tackled corbin through the wall of hbks office with hbk watching from his desk the show caused with more security showing up to break the brawl johns thoughts a decent enough contract signing but i felt like nothing stood out much the content was a bit rough too i believe we got this before with booker as the moderator i think it was taken a step back without any sort of moderator they probably could have used hbk who was clearly around but maybe they wanted him for that final shot in his office which could have also been a pretape if they wanted what really stood out was they were laying it on thick that trick williams will be involved somehow particularly with melo stuttering his name in accidentally saying hes better than trick past weeks have had stronger nxt standalone shows but this weeks goal was to give final pushes for nxt no mercy and i think they did a decent job at that the trick williams story is pretty interesting because a lot of this is a pivot audible due to mustafa ali being released but nxt did find a way to give trick the shine of the night while weaving it into the main event story listen to pro wrestling boom podcast on spreaker we value your privacy privacy policy

up to the nxt parking lot shotzi blackheart and scarlett walked out dressed as sexy ghostbusters they headed to the performance center the band new years day performed their song vampyre live they also showed clips of last weeks halloween havoc night one vic joseph and booker t were on commentary alicia taylor was the ring announcer the creed brothers and ivy nile made their entrance angel garza and humberto carrillo were jumped during their entrance by the creeds they both wore prematch skull masks 1 brutus creed and julius creed vs angel garza and humberto carrillo in a tables ladders and scares match brutus immediately held down carrillo on a table julius gave angel a death valley driver and sent both carrillo and garza through the table angel managed to turn the tide with a chair shot to juliuss back carrillo took down brutus with a enzuigiri garza and carrillo made a ladder bridge with chairs and a ladder julius recovered and trapped garza and carrillo under a ladder brutus slammed another ladder on top of the ladder the creeds opened more tables at ringside which hyped up the crowd garza tossed brutus into the ringpost garza and carrillo brawled with juius to the top rope they both gave julius a super press slam through the ladder bridge garza trapped brutus in a gory special while in the special carrillo gave brutus a blockbuster through the tables at ringside the show cut to pictureinpicture julius and brutus traded chair shots which included protected chairshots to the face carrillo gave brutus a chair assisted enzuigiri which may have been unprotected carrillo gave brutus a missile dropkick on a chair julius broke up the pin carrillo gave julius a deadlift power bomb through a ladder julius kicked out at two brutus jabbed both opponents in the gut with a chair brutus then knocked down both opponents with a helicopter spun ladder the referee looked afraid for his life brutus baseball slid a a ladder into the cousins the cousins hit a ladder around the neck of brutus julius hit both opponents with a cannonball julius had bruises on his back from the match the creeds set up more tables brutus punched garza off the top rope through a table the creeds then gave carrillo a doomsday brutus ball for the victory both creeds pinned carrillo brutus creed and julius creed defeated humberto carrillo and angel garza via pinfall in 1403 johns thoughts sick tag team match the creeds showed they have a bright future ahead of them while the garza cousins showed that they are criminally underutilized in wwe only criticism i had was all those head aimed chair shots in the middle of the match i hope they were protected because its not cool if they werent both teams are going to be feeling it tomorrow because they were giving each other a ton of battle scars here both teams needed wins but with the creeds possibly called up to raw full time the creeds were the right team to put over strong i just hope that wwe also sees the value they have in the garza cousins shotzi and scarlett were playing with a ouija board shotzi was dressed as a clown alba fyre and isla dawn showed up and offered to take over the show host duties which shotzi and scarlett agreed to hand the show over mckenzie mitchell interviewed tiffany stratton who walked off when mckenzie praised fallon henleys tiffany stratton impersonation johns thoughts i do hope fallon henley caught the eyes of wwe officials she really showed her range in that impersonation joe gacy was cutting a promo talking about how he likes horrors he said he makes mistakes and nobody is perfect but still peers friends and strangers stab him with their judgmental eyes gacy asked if hes the problem he said hes not asking for forgiveness but understands he has darkness in him from his past he said now theres no strings holding him back now johns thoughts good promo and interesting too it looks like hes going to go back to his unhinged character he had in czw the guy is a great talker so hopefully this gimmick sticks they wasted too much time with him in that crappy cult faction he had before ilja dragunov was doing jump rope exercises looking ripped tiffany stratton jumpped fallon henley during her entrance and tossed her into the ringpost tiffany gave henley a kneebar against the ringpost referees ran out and the match didnt start because fallon was injured vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table they sent the show to this years haunted house cinematic featuring the meta four and akira tozawa the meta four were dressed as the scooby doo gang with oro as shaggy noam as scooby lash as velma and jakara as daphne they quickly ran away from their first attempt to enter the house because there was a ghoul person jakara mocked oro for looking like a hood shaggy they managed to buy sandwiches after their first failed attempt noam finally fustered up the bravery to enter the house they ran away when to skeleton men scared them from behind a to be continued graphic aired vic joseph hyped up wwe announcing they are having an event in germany nathan frazer made his entrance first dominik mysterio made his entrance with rhea ripley rhea was dressed as a cop while dom was dressed as her prisoner 2 dominik mysterio wrhea ripley vs nathan frazer for the nxt north american championship both men had a collar and elbow lockup early on with dom getting the first armdrag frazer put dom in a headlock dom came back with a hip toss dom punched nathan in the corner nathan escaped the corner and gave dom 3 hip tosses and a dropkick dom went to retreat to mami nathan ran circles around dom and caught dom with a flying axe handle strike the show cut to pictureinpicture dom hit nathan with two of the three amigos frazer reversed the third suplex with a brainbuster frazer rallied with strikes nathan hit dom with a scorpion death drop with dom landing a bit awkwardly dom kicked out and gave frazer a jawbreaker on the top rope frazer gave dom a baseball slide dom dodged a dive at ringside and gave nathan a superkick frazer recovered and gave dom a suicide dive frazer reversed a frog splash into a superplex final cut combo for a nearfall rhea tossed the womens title to dom but dom didnt make the catch dom dialed it up but nathan blocked a 619 with a superkick dom tripped frazer off the ropes and hit frazer with the frog splash for the win dominik mysterio defeated nathan frazer via pinfall in 1026 to retain the nxt north amerian championship after the match dom was attacked by the returning wes lee dom went to rhea to retreat wes picked up the na title and posed with it johns thoughts good match with dom gaining from working with the protégé of seth rollins did get a little bit rough in the middle portion but both men recovered dom bringing back his prison dom gimmick was great but it also made me miss his skits where dom and rhea would terrorize rey mysterios family every holiday can we get one of those again dom does benefit by getting the dominant win after the failed cheating attempt gives him some credibility dom vs wes should be fun and i hope nxt gives dom and rhea promo time because theres money with them on the mic jacy jayne congratulated andre chase for winning the tag titles and wanted credit for helping them win chase didnt want to praise jacy duke hudson and thea hail showed up hyped up after the girls left tony d and stacks showed up and asked for their entitled rematch hudson agreed and said theyll get it after everyone left alba fyre and isla dawn showed up dressed as poison ivy and harley quinn they did their usual creepy talk a bit hard to decipher sometimes due to albas thick accent bron breakker vs robert stone was hyped for after the break back at the haunted house jakara jackson was by herself and freaking out she walked through a random closet but was scared by a random monster other monsters also scared her oro mensah was spooked by a random man with pale paint more random costumed character showed up to scare oro oro hit one of the men with a sandwich tozawa showed up and knocked out oro tozawa and random ninjas kidnapped oro lash legend thought she found the heritage cup but found a random trophy lash was spoked by a monster in a sink a pumpkin masked monster kidnapped lash to be continued robert stone was in the ring as a replay aired of bron breakker smashing von wagners skull bron breakker made his entrance looking confident while stone looked the opposite 3 bron breakker vs robert stone stone tried to run away early on with bron being confident and cutting stone off at the pass stone managed to run away and even land a punch stone did dodge a few tackles but ultimately was taken down with a shoulder tackle bron tossed stone like a shot put while continuing to sell his confidence bron said hell send stone to rehab like von stone tossed bron into the buckle and rolled up bron for a two count bron quickly came back with a saito suplex bron took down the straps and hit stone with a spear for the easy win bron breakker defeated robert stone via pinfall in 238 bron dragged stone to ringside and was about to smash the steel steps on stone bron was stopped in his tracks with von wagner making his entrance von had a bandage on his head von dumped bron to ringside and gave bron a chokeslam von sold brain damage for a second bron retreated to the back after von missed hitting bron with the steel steps von helped stone to his feet johns thoughts you really have to turn your brain off with this whole brain damage and attempted onair murder storyline i also get a bit turned off at the cheesy rehab segments though i still get a kick out of vons bad but endearing acting in terms of acting though the bright spot in this feud has been robert stone whos showing his range as a serious wrestler this is the stone ive been wanting to see for years dating back to stones run in tna i hope this leads to more of a push for stone somehow speaking of tna good to see stone back in the ring he played the role perfectly and bron also did a great job selling confidence throughout the foregone conclusion carmelo hayes was shown psyching himself up in the locker room highlights from last weeks nxt womens title change aired an irish narrator talked about lyra completing her journey to the title against one of the best in wwe the narrator then talked about all the people in ireland talking about being proud of both countrywomen lyra was shown making the irish news rounds vic joseph thanked the band new years day again for providing the theme song for halloween havoc scrypts bronco nima and lucien price were cutting a promo in front of graffiti walls scrypts talked about how people thought wrong about him for the longest time thinking he sipped wine all his life or be a running traveling circus he said he did that to fit in with everyone he said he met nima and price and they reminded him of where he came from he said hes reggie but back in da hood in st louis they call him scrypts he talked about being locked up shot at had to watch his grandfather die in his bedroom he said he is cut from the same cloth as lucien and bronco scrypts called out the brawling brutes for being cookie cutter and not being able to last in the hoods scrypts talked about how the brutes cost them a shot the tag titles scrypts said youre either somebody or nobody and otm are somebody johns thoughts hell yes finally and a long time coming flipping guy reggie overstayed its welcome and emoscrypts was a shockmaster esque flop putting scrypts with nima and price was a match made in heaven this was reggies best promo in wwe to date and i hope he continues to keep it up he also gives nima and price street credibility because of his past as a real life crip entrances for the next match took place jayne and hail jumped the champions during their entrance thats about 3 matches tonight having jumpstarts 4 chelsea green and piper niven vs jacy jayne and thea hail wandre chase duke hudson for the wwe womens tag team championships jayne and hail used tags to cut the ring in half on green green dumped hail to ringside hail dodged a slide and took down green with a dive jayne used a cannonball to save hail from niven hail and jayne did dx crotch chops heading into pictureinpicture booker compared chelsea and piper to hbk and kevin nash piper used her power to block a kimura hail got a window of opportunity with a ddt green tagged in and dragged hail away hail dodged an elbow drop and tagged in jayne for the hot tag jayne cleaned house jayne caught niven with a superkick jayne caught green with a cannonball jayne escaped a unprettier and hit green with a uranage piper broke up jaynes pin niven caught hail with a flapjack slam jayne and green took each other out with pump kicks chase and hudson rallied up the crowd jayne wanted to use the tag belt but chase pulled it away and didnt want the cheating green caught the distracted jayne with an unprettier for the victory chelsea green and piper niven defeated jacy jayne and thea hail via pinfall in 858 to retain the wwe womens tag team championships alba fyre and isla dawn were laughing from the crows nest section johns thoughts well worked tag match green and niven are getting a chance to build good chemistry heres still hoping that the wwe womens tag title curse is on hold or gone having the tag belts on nxt would benefit due to nxts deep womens roster and large focus on womens wrestling if i remember correctly the womens division was featured in 6 or 7 matches last week lexis king sat on his throne and thanked mckenzie mitchell for providing his first interview king said hes pleased at all the attention the name lexis king is getting he said hes used to the attention he said its his life and hes doing things his way lexis said youre going to have to wait to see what i already have done mckenzie asked what that meant king said everyone will have to wait mckenzie ended the interview and king asked her to stick around a while for candy mckenzie declined vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table vic announced the return of the iron survivor match for the deadline ple entrances for the next match took place 5 kelani jordan vs lola vice welektra lopez in the finals of the nxt womens breakout tournamentlola started the match with kicks from a fighting pose jordan gave vice a armdrag lola came back with rapid kicks lola gave kelani a hip attack she yelled im a latina while shaking her booty the show cut to pictureinpicture vice tripped up kelani kelani dodged a hip attack vice hit kelani with a nice looking front kick enzuigiri kelani rallied with a series of elbows kelani hit vice with a flip leg drop for a two count vice escaped an overdrive attempt jordan ducked a kick but vice follwed through with a thrust kick to the gut jordan hit vice with a legsweep jordan hit vice with an overdrive lopez got on the apron for a distraction this allowed vice do dodge a moonsault vice caught jordan with a nice looking hook kick to the head for the win lola vice defeated kelani jordan via pinfall in 656 to win the nxt womens breakout tournament johns thoughts as usual rough at points but forgivable due to both women being developmental projects jordan definitely has a lot of upside and you can see why people in wwe are high on her vice continues to improve and in continued to be impressed by her striking offense vice was the right person to go over because jordan has more character development and vice still needs to be made i dont think shes going after the womens title yet because shes not ready in terms of inring maybe she and elektra cash in on a tag title shot nxt womens division is deep enough for a midcard womens title too if they want to introduce something there back at the haunted house scooby doo noam dar was yealling and asking for tozawa to give him back his heritage cup dar then found the cup and said it was the best day of his life for some reason he licked the cup dar then acted emotional and romantic with the cup noam was surrounded by the random masked people dar said hell bay them twice what tozawa is paying them tozawa took the cup back and begged dar for title shot dar gave him the title shot after the random costumed people freaked him out tozawa then ordered the costumed people to dogpile dar johns thoughts nxt does a cheesy halloween haunted house skit every year and they are hit and miss this years was on the miss side there was just no real effort in the story other than the usual random costumed extras acting spooky very generic and disappointing given how entertaining meta four are as characters only bright spot was the meta fours scooby doo costumes carmelo hayes and ilja dragunov were shown heading to the ring in separate camera shots isla dawn and alba fyre were acting like witches backstage the camera panned over to von wagner yelling that he wants a match against breakker next week stone yelled that von is not ready due to recovering from brain damage von said he needs to end this von continued to sell the dizziness from the brain damage stone asked von if hes alright von said hes ok and just wants a match noam dar vs akira tozawa for the heritage cup lyra valkyria appearing and nxt deadline qualifying matches were advertised for next weeks nxt with 8 minutes left at the top of the hour carmelo hayes made his entrance wearing a justice for trick shirt ilja dragunov made his entrance alicia taylor handled the formal inring introductions 6 ilja dragunov vs carmelo hayes for the nxt championshipboth men started off even trading strikes ilja planted melo with agerman suplex ilja nosold a german from melo melo and ilja traded elbows in the center of the ring both men traded paintbrush slaps and took each other out with high roundhouse kicks the show cut to pictureinpicture both men traded strong style right hands ilja chopped melo in the knee cap and gave melo a german suplex ilja avoided a springboard ddt and ran through melo ilja hit melo with a jackknife power bomb for a two count melo staggered ilja with two superkicks and a pump kick ilja responded with a lariat for a two count melo reversed a constantine special with a la mistica slam for a two count ilja tossed melo off the top rope melo recovered and knocked ilja off the top rope with a gamengiri melo gave ilja a sick looking spike ddt on the ring apron melo hit ilja with a frog splash for a nearfall both men slowly got to their feet and traded hands melo got the upper hand with overhead shots ilja came back with a stiff lariat and senton ilja planted melo with a gutwrench suplex for a two count melo gave ilja a pump kick ilja came back with a few mafia kicks ilja managed to land a standing h bomb diving forearm but was too fatigued for the cover ilja escaped a final cut and chopped melo in the back of the neck melo blocked a constantine special with a pump kick the match was at the 12 minute mark ilja blocked a spike ddt and put melo in fireman carry ilja hit melo with an attitude adjustment on the ring apron ilja roared and cleared the announce table ilja spilled vics weekly bowl of candy to the floor ilja put melo on the announce table and climbed to the barricade ilja hit melo with a diving h bomb through the table vic noted that the referee was being lenient to allow both men to fight the referee allowed both men to enter the ring without rush ilja gave melo a boot against the bottom buckle melo blocked a coast to coast ilja reversed a codebreaker melo tossed ilja into the buckle and landed a codebreaker but ilja no sold it and hit an h bomb for a nearfall melo blocked an h bomb with a codebreaker melo was going for nothin but net but froze when trick williams made his entrance vic noted it looked like melo saw a ghost ilja caught melo with a slap and superplex ilja hit melo with torpedo moscow for the victory ilja dragunov defeated carmelo hayes via pinfall in 1642 to retain the nxt championship highlights from the epic match aired after ilja left trick williams slowly entered the ring trick slowly walked to carmelo hayes vic wondered if melo was the man that attacked trick suddenly commotion could be heard the camera cut to the gorilla position where baron corbin attacked ilja the show closed 14 minutes into the overrun johns thoughts another instant classic these ilja vs melo matches have hbks fingerprints all over it in a good way my guess is that hbk was the road agent for this match given his love for workrate and melodrama you can see why hbk loves melo and ilja given that they are very similar instyle to the heartbreak kid these guys can do no wrong against each other and should fight forever yes sometimes i get mad at an epic match ending in a distraction finish but it fit in well to the story theyre telling with trick williams theyre laying it on too thick that carmelo hayes is the culprit for attacking trick to the point where im wondering if its a misdirect and they have someone else in mind i dont think theyre going to introduce wes lee because of how he returned tonight but that might be a misdirect too i like that they didnt end the show with a definite answer because it makes people want to tune in next week coming off the cliffhanger they can always go with baron corbin being the culprit but that would be an underwhelming copout they could also go with lexis king being the culprit with him saying i did something but didnt reveal what that something is nxt halloween havoc were two hot shows both shows anchored by strong main events but the rest of the matches delivered too i would say that night one wins the battle of being the better show because there were a few misses this week this years haunted house skit did nothing for me and was a downgrade compared to some of their past attempts i remember the dexter lumis vs cameron grimes and even last years alba fyre vs toxic attraction being more entertaining speaking of fyre and dawn a bit disappointing as this weeks hosts to the point where i was kinda hoping that wed get scarlett and shotzi back who did an amazing job last week i like dawn and fyres acting work as witches they just didnt really give them any material to do anything if you are limited on time definitely check out the bookend matches of this show maybe even check out the scrypts promo too for the nice character shift listen to pro wrestling boom podcast
