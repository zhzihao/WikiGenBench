{"id": 69823383, "key": "National Firefighter Registry for Cancer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Firefighter%20Registry%20for%20Cancer", "text": "The National Firefighter Registry for Cancer (NFR) is a voluntary registry of firefighters in the United States used to evaluating cancer rates and cancer risk factors in the U.S. fire service through collecting relevant occupational, lifestyle, and health information on firefighters. It aims to use this data to reduce cancer in firefighters.\n\nThe NFR was created by the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 in response to growing evidence of carcinogenic exposures and increased risk for cancer faced by firefighters. It opened to registration by firefighters in April 2023. The NFR is maintained by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).\n\nBackground\n\nCancer among firefighters \n\n \nCancer risk in the U.S. fire service is a topic of growing concern. Firefighters regularly encounter carcinogenic materials and hazardous contaminants on the fireground. Several studies have documented airborne and/or dermal exposures to carcinogenic compounds during firefighting, as well as contamination on turnout gear and other equipment worn by firefighters.  Some of these compounds have been shown to absorb into firefighters’ bodies.  Some firefighters also work with hazardous materials and are trained to control and clean up dangerous materials such as oil spills and chemical accidents.  In addition to chemical exposures, night shift work has been classified by IARC as a probable human carcinogen factor.\n\nUnlike structural firefighters, wildland firefighters typically do not wear respiratory protection, and may inhale particulate and other compounds emitted by the wildfires. A risk assessment conducted using an exposure–response relationship concluded that wildland firefighters could have an increased risk of lung cancer mortality. \n\nRecent studies suggest that exposure on the fireground may increase risk to firefighters of certain types of cancer and other chronic diseases.  In addition to epidemiological studies, several mechanistic studies using biomarkers have found evidence of DNA damage, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes related to firefighters' exposures.\n\nData sources \nWhile U.S. state cancer registries provide rich data for studying cancer in the U.S., they often do not provide comprehensive information on cancer patients’ work history and workplace practices, making it challenging to use this data source alone for studying cancer in firefighters. It is also important to collect information on personal and lifestyle risk factors (e.g. tobacco and alcohol use, sleep deprivation, diet, and physical activity) in the U.S. fire service to better understand how they may affect the relationship between firefighting and cancer.\n\nDue to the lack of central and comprehensive sources of data, research on cancer rates amongst firefighters has been challenging. Although some evidence suggests the risk for specific cancer types could vary for male, female, and non-white firefighters, the strength of the evidence related to cancer in demographic subgroups is limited because many previous studies have mainly comprised white male samples of firefighters. Larger samples of female firefighters and minority groups are needed before the conclusions can be drawn about cancer risk across the nation’s diverse fire service.  Additionally, the research on cancer for some subspecialty groups of firefighters, such as training exposures, is limited.\n\nCreation and implementation \n\nThe Firefighter Cancer Registry Act of 2018 bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives on February 7, 2017, by Robert Menendez. It required the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create a registry designed to collect data on cancer rates among U.S. firefighters. The bill was passed with unanimous and bipartisan approval on July 7, 2018.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would cost around 10 million dollars. However, the Republican Policy Committee stated that the cost of the bill would be offset by a reduction in the funding of the CDC.  NIOSH, part of the CDC, has been given authority to lead this effort, beginning in fiscal year 2019, with input from the scientific and firefighting communities.\n\nIt opened to registration by firefighters in April 2023.  By that May, over 4,000 firefighters had enrolled.\n\nOperation \n\nThe proposed approach for the NFR states it will be a voluntary workplace health surveillance system of U.S. firefighters over the age of 18 years. The main goal of the NFR, according to the text of the law, is \"to develop and maintain…a voluntary registry of firefighters to collect relevant health and occupational information of such firefighters for purposes of determining cancer incidence.\" According to the Republican Policy Committee's summary, the NFR aims to provide decision makers with data to help them create new protocols to protect firefighters. It aims to register around 200,000 firefighters across a variety of demographics within 5 years. NIOSH plans to recruit firefighters through various communication channels (e.g., NFR website and newsletter, social media, local/state/national unions, affinity groups, trade journals, conference attendees) or directly from selected rosters of firefighters.\n\nParticipation in the NFR is entirely voluntary and is open to all firefighters, including retired ones. Firefighters who register will provide their name, date of birth, and information about their lifestyle and exposures. Following this participants may be given voluntary yearly questionnaires. NIOSH can then use this information to track past and future diagnoses of cancer among NFR participants by matching with data from state cancer registries to understand how firefighters’ work impacts their risk of developing cancer.\n\nCancer is a nationally notifiable condition, and thus all U.S. states track diagnoses of cancer in a state cancer registry. The NFR is planned to also seek additional details about participant’s types of emergency responses attended and exposures by working with fire departments and exposure tracking programs (if applicable), and by administering follow-up questionnaires to registered firefighters. Because cancer has a long latency period – which is the time between exposure to carcinogens and the development of cancer – the NFR will monitor cancer outcomes for decades.\n\nThe NFR program receives input and guidance from the NFR Subcommittee, a subcommittee of the NIOSH Board of Scientific Counselors (a Federal Advisory Committee), consisting of 12 rotating subject matter experts in firefighting, epidemiology, medicine, or public health.\n\nFirefighter enrollment \nAll members can enroll through a web portal. NIOSH states that any information gathered through the program will only be accessible to NIOSH researchers and will be protected with multi-factor authentication and \"multiple layers of encryption.\" Firefighters may access the web portal through the dedicated NFR website (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/registry.html or https://www.cdc.gov/NFR) or by directly accessing the web portal. To complete enrollment in the NFR, participants will need to set up an account, complete an informed consent document, user profile, and enrollment questionnaire.\n\nThe user profile will serve to collect basic information from the firefighter that could change over time and hence can be accessed and updated by the user. The enrollment questionnaire will collect information on employment/workplace characteristics, exposure, demographics, lifestyle factors, comorbidities, and other confounders. The enrollment process, including the questionnaire, is designed to take 30–45 minutes to complete. Following enrollment, NIOSH will send NFR participants notifications for periodic follow-up questionnaires (e.g., one per year) to be filled out through the web portal.\n\nOther sources of information \nIn addition to roster information, NIOSH plans to request fire incident records dating back to January 1, 2010, or earlier when available, from fire departments for some participants. Fire departments are required to collect some basic information about fire incidents under the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) established by the U.S. Fire Administration. Department incident records will provide NIOSH investigators with apparatus and incident-specific information to be used as surrogates of exposure for exposure-response analyzes. Specific variables of interest requested from department incident records may include: incident number, fire station, apparatus, incident type (structure fire, car fire, etc.), on scene time, off scene time, job assignments, number of fire runs, and duration at fires. NIOSH will explore obtaining records directly through states, NFIRS, and/or software vendors to reduce the burden on each participating fire department.\n\nReferences \n\nOccupational cancer\nCancer organizations\nFirefighting in the United States\nNational Institute for Occupational Safety and Health", "unikey": "National Firefighter Registry for Cancer", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Creation_and_implementation", "Operation", "References"], "contents": ["### Cancer among firefighters\nCancer risk in the U.S. fire service is a topic of growing concern.

study which included field evaluation of the performance of the selfcontained breathing apparatus scba worn by firefighters during structural firefighting measurements were made for a variety of contaminants including co co2 benzene hcn hcl h2so4 hf acrolein ch4 formaldehyde and pnas many of the analyses were performed by collection of bag samples followed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using a field mobile spectrometer measurements were also made using solid sorbent tubes and directreading meters sampling was done both during the knockdown and during overhaul phases of structural firefighting also in order to estimate exposures including those when the scbas were worn measurements were made both inside and outside the scba facepiece carbon monoxide was the most common contaminant found during knockdown and about 10 of the samples were greater than 1500 ppm formaldehyde acrolein hydrogen chloride hydrogen cyanide sulphuric acid and hydrogen fluoride all exceeded their respective shortterm exposure limits stel on some occasions approximately 50 of the knockdown samples for acrolein exceeded the stel during overhaul when masks were usually not worn many of the contaminants found during knockdown were detected but typically at much lower concentrations insidemask sampling data suggest that exposure to low concentrations of a variety of compounds is occurring but this is believed to be principally the result of early mask removal or of nonuse during knockdown rather than of leakage the three basic sampling approaches bag sampling sorbent tubes and directreading meters proved in this study to be complementary and served to maximize our ability to detect and quantify a wide range of combustion products pubmed disclaimer similar articles

full text links citedisplay options display options format abstractpubmedpmid abstract firefighters can be exposed to a complex set of contaminants while at a fire scene identifying new ways to monitor and assess exposure particularly relating to toxicity is essential to determine the effectiveness of intervention techniques to reduce exposure this study investigated the use of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah calux bioassay for the assessment of exposure and associated toxicity firefighters might encounter this was done through analysis of extracts of dermal wipes and urine samples collected from firefighters before and after a controlled fire an increased bioassay response was observed from postfire neck and calf samples indicating a greater concentration of pahlike compounds on the skin the use of a baby wipe to clean the face and neck during rehab resulted in the attenuation of the observed bioassay response from the neck postfire though a correlation was observed between the bioassay response and hydroxylated pah concentrations found in the urine the increased bioassay response from the postfire urine samples was likely due to unknown compounds other than the hydroxylated pahs tested our results suggest that this bioassay provides a useful measure of firefighter exposure particularly relating to the potential toxicity of contaminants

produced with sometimes conflicting conclusions in this overview of reviews we aim to assess the conclusion consistency across the available systematic reviews on the cancer risk in firefighters literature searches were conducted in several indexed databases and grey literature to retrieve systematic reviews aiming to evaluate cancer incidence or cancer mortality in firefighters results from included srs were analyzed according to the tumour site out of 1054 records identified by the search in the databases a total of 11 srs were ultimately included the original studies n  104 analyzed in the srs were published between 1959 and 2018 the results consistently reported a significant increase in the incidence of rectal prostate bladder and testicular cancers as well as mesothelioma and malignant melanoma in firefighters compared to the general population the srs also indicate that death rates from rectal cancer and nonhodgkins lymphoma are higher among firefighters consistent sr results suggest that several types of cancer may be more frequent in firefighters than in the general population keywords carcinogens contaminants firefighters occupational health pubmed disclaimer

responded to controlled residential fires and examined the results by job assignment and fire attack tactic urine was analyzed for metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and breath was analyzed for volatile organic compounds vocs including benzene median concentrations of pah metabolites in urine increased from prefirefighting to 3h post firefighting for all job assignments this change was greatest for firefighters assigned to attack and search with 23 56 39 and 14fold median increases in pyrene phenanthrene naphthalene and fluorene metabolites median exhaled breath concentrations of benzene increased 2fold for attack and search firefighters p  001 and 14fold for outside vent firefighters p  002 compared to interior attack transitional attack resulted in 50 less uptake of pyrene p  009 36 less uptake phenanthrene p  0052 and 20 less uptake of fluorene p  001 dermal absorption likely contributed to firefighters exposures in this study firefighters exposures

abstract objectives firefighters are potentially exposed to a wide range of known and suspected carcinogens through their work the objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of cancer among nordic firefighters and to compare them with the results from previous studies methods data for this study were drawn from a linkage between the census data for 15 million people from the five nordic countries and their cancer registries for the period 19612005 sir analyses were conducted with the cancer incidence rates for the entire national study populations used as reference rates results a total of 16 422 male firefighters were included in the final cohort a moderate excess risk was seen for all cancer sites combined sir106 95 ci 102 to 111 there were statistically significant excesses in the age category of 3049 years in prostate cancer sir259 95 ci 134 to 452 and skin melanoma sir162 95 ci 114 to 223 while there was almost no excess in the older ages by contrast an increased risk mainly in ages of 70 years and higher was observed for nonmelanoma skin cancer sir140 95 ci 110 to 176 multiple myeloma sir169 95 ci 108 to 251 adenocarcinoma of the lung sir190 95 ci 134 to 262 and mesothelioma sir259 95 ci 124 to 477 by contrast with earlier studies the incidence of testicular cancer was decreased sir051 95 ci 023 to 098 conclusions some of these associations have been observed previously and potential exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons asbestos and shift work involving disruption of circadian rhythms may partly explain these results keywords cancer firefighters

cancerlit and healthstar for the period between 1966 to january 2007 was conducted we also retrieved additional studies by manual searching resultsa total of 49 studies were included in the metaanalysis we found statistically significant associations between firefighting and cancers of bladder brain and cns and colorectal cancers consistent with several previous risk estimates we also found statistically significant associations of firefighting with nonhodgkins lymphoma skin melanoma prostate and testicular cancer for kidney hodgkins lymphoma leukemia lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer we found some statistically significant but less consistent results for all other cancers evaluated esophageal laryngeal oral and pharyngeal liver and gallbladder lung lymphatic and hematopoietic nonmelanoma skin cancer stomach and urinary cancer we did not find any statistically significant associations conclusionsalthough our metaanalysis showed statistically significant increased risks of either cancer incidence or mortality of certain cancers in association with firefighting a number of important limitations of the underlying studies exist which precluded our ability to arrive at definitive conclusions regarding causationkey words cancer incidence mortality firefighters review metaanalysisintroductionfirefighting has been highlighted by many previous investigations and reviews as a hazardous occupation it has been repeatedly documented that firefighters are potentially exposed to a variety of toxic chemicals at their job including certain known carcinogens their working environment is unique in terms of the complexity of workplace exposures because firefighters exposure is varied often high and intermittent melius 2001 for example fires vary greatly in the nature of materials burned their size and the weather the nature and concentrations of airborne particles change at the fire scene and during the stage of the fire golden et al 1995 clearly firefighting is a physically demanding job that exposes firefighters to acute hazards as well as potentially longterm cumulative exposures hazardous exposures for firefighters include smoke particulate matter carbon monoxide co oxides of nitrogen nox hydrogen chloride hydrogen cyanide sulfur dioxide so2 sulfuric acid acrolein and many other organic chemicals niosh 2004 additionally firefighters are exposed to a number of carcinogenic agents including benzene benzidine dioxins dibenzofurans asbestos polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 1 3butadiene formaldehyde and acrylonitrile melius 2001 golden et al 1995 brandtrauf et al 1988 austin et al 2001 furthermore given the complexity of fire smoke firefighters may be exposed to additional carcinogens and toxins generated at the fire scene during combustion niosh 2004many of these exposures cause acute effects but others may cause chronic health problems such as respiratory disease cardiovascular disease and cancer cancer among firefighters has been investigated in past decades but the extent of the occupational risk of cancer among firefighters is not yet fully understood several mortality studies suggested an increased risk of cancer mortality in firefighters including leukemia brain cancer multiple myeloma nonhodgkins lymphoma bladder cancer colorectal stomach and prostate cancer melius 2001 golden et al 1995 burnett et al 1994 however the majority of these individual studies have several limitations identifying associations between firefighters occupational exposures and cancer risk constitutes a challenging task mainly due to the small size of such studies the short followup periods the difficulties obtaining data on occupational exposure and the usually long latency periods 1030 years associated with the development of different cancers guidotti 2007 chaudhry et al 2004 not surprisingly the published studies are not always consistent and our knowledge base for determining the degree of occupational risk for cancer among firefighters remains incomplete while a substantial body of original literature has been published on the association of occupational hazards of firefighting and the risk of cancer few metaanalyses have been conducted examining the strength and consistency of cancer risk associations among firefighters chaudhry et al 2004 howe and lindsay 1983 lemasters et al 2006 in the current report we undertook a systematic review and metaanalysis of existing literature in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the association between the occupation of firefighting and the risk of specific predefined cancers in addition to deriving an overall pooled estimate of specific cancer incidence and mortality in association with firefighting we also examined doseresponse relationships using duration of employment and time since first employment latency we also qualitatively evaluated the possible impact of changes in personal protective equipment on cancer risk for the periods pre and post1990materials and methodswe conducted a comprehensive literature search of several electronic databases with the assistance of two librarians with expertise in electronic resources cancerlit and healthstar were migrated and folded into medline hence medline embase and web of science biosis and nioshtic2 were selected as the target databases for our search these were searched for published papers letters abstracts and review articles on the cancer risk among firefighters relevant articles were identified using a combined text word and medical subject headings mesh or subject heading search strategy our search terms included 1 firefighter firefighter or firefighter or fire fighter or fireman or firemen or fire fighters 2 fires  which intended to capture all reports on cancers due to occupational exposure to fires or the occupation of firefighting the original search was conducted for the period between 1960 through january 2007 and was restricted to human studies published in english we also retrieved additional studies by manually searching the bibliographies of original research reports and review articlesdata are presented for 24 specific cancers namely bladder brain and central nervous system colorectal colon rectum esophagus larynx oral and pharynx kidney liver and gallbladder lung hodgkins lymphoma nonhodgkins lymphoma leukemia lymphatic and hematopoietic lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma multiple myeloma pancreatic prostate malignant melanoma nonmelanoma skin cancer stomach testicular and urinary cancer for each one of these cancer sites the relevant studies were grouped by two main outcomes namely cancer incidence and cancer mortality subgroup analysis while several studies provided information and risk estimates on both outcomes if a study provided estimates for more than one cancer site then the information was included in the analysis of each cancer site separately selection of studies inclusion and exclusion criteria the electronic search identified 387 references after screening all abstracts that contained firefighters and risk of cancers 139 articles were considered potentially eligible and a detailed review was conducted an article was excluded if it was a review article without original data or did not report quantitative effect estimates duplicate publications including proceedings that preceded a peerreviewed article were identified and each original study was used only once our inclusion criteria were 1 english studies with assessment of cancer risk for firefighters 2 cohort studies casecontrol crosssectional andor surveillance studies 3 study population of firefighters with a comparison group 4 exposure captured by firefighters as an occupation or fire as an occupational exposure and 5 a quantitative effect estimate was provided such as standardized mortality ratio smr proportional mortality ratio pmr relative risk rr standardized incidence ratio sir casecontrol odds ratio or standardized relative risk srr mortality odds ratio mor and standardized mortality odds ratio smor one study using standardized registration ratio srr was also included donnan 1996 srr is the number of cancer registrations in an area during a time period expressed as a percentage of the number of cancer cases expected in the area if age specific rates of a standard population occurred in the area of interest we excluded studies in which the study population overlapped with other articles if there was more than one article with the same or overlapping population preference was given to the article providing more comprehensive information the main reasons for excluding studies were overlapping populations relevance of occupational data and no specific information about firefightersa qualitative description of each study included in the metaanalysis is summarized in appendix a categorized by study design and presenting geographic region years of followup characteristics of study population reference population exposure definition cancer outcome and other available confounder information data were extracted for each study with incidence andor mortality outcomes cancer sites and corresponding icd codes effect measures risk estimates and confidence intervals or pvalues assessment of study quality methods for defining study quality in observational studies are less clearly established therefore we developed quality criteria based on a modified moose guideline stroup et al 2000 each individual study was scored 1 0 1 on each of the following dimensions of the study design a selection of cases and controls b comparability c assessment of exposure and outcome and d data analysis and measurement for instance a cohort design received a score of plus one while a zero score was assigned to a casecontrol study and a score of minus one to a surveillance study a high proportion of missing information or lost to followup was scored as negative one on the dimension of selection of cases and controls pmr andor mor were considered as noncomparable outcome measures therefore they were scored negatively with respect to the dimension of data analysis and measurement if a study reported information about smoking or other confounding factors then the comparability section would receive a score of positive one three reviewers were involved in the quality assessment two researchers with expertise in the area of occupational and environmental epidemiology reviewed each article independently reviewers independently assigned an overall rating to each study any discrepancies were discussed and resolved through consensus involving a third expert reviewer the final quantitative score was then transformed into a qualitative category for each study based on the qualitative assessment score the studies were categorized as weak adequate or good the classification of weak was reserved for studies where the potential for bias was thought to be high based on methods described by the authors or where the study could not contribute data for specific cancer sites among a total of 49 studies included in the metaanalysis aronson et al 1994 baris et al 2001 bates et al 1995 bates et al 2000 bates et al 2007 beaumont et al 1991 burns and swanson 1991 burnett et al 1994 delahunt et al 1995 demers et al 1992 demers et al 1994 deschamps et al 1995 dolin and cookmozaffari 1992 donnan 1996 dubrow and

fiedler 1987 zeegers et al 2004 20 articles were classified as good 11 as adequate and 18 as weak to examine whether there was a difference in the results based only on good studies pooled estimates were calculated for each specific cancer using all studies using good studies only and finally using both good and adequate studies together following the data extraction and quality assessment steps the list of studies to be included in the analysis were grouped by anatomic cancer site based on the icd codes as provided by each studys authors if the icd codes were not provided which was the case in some studies grouping was based on the actual description of the cancer site as indicated by the text of the article itself statistical analyses pooled estimates and confidence intervals presented were derived using stata version 100 the corresponding pooled estimates and confidence intervals in the figures were calculated with the use of the review manager software version 42 developed and made available to the general public by the cochrane collaboration group review manager 2002 the metaanalytic procedure of the inverse variance method was used that is the weight given to each study is chosen to be the inverse of the variance of the effect estimate the confidence intervals were slightly altered using the random effects model because the weights given to each study were different especially with respect to the smaller studies the data were entered as logarithms of the actual values but the final results are displayed on the original scale following the appropriate transformation the logarithm of the risk estimate was included first together with the corresponding standard error calculated for 95 confidence intervals using the following formula selogrisk estimatelogupper confidence limitlower confidence limit2196 if the confidence interval was not given but a pvalue was provided then the standard error was calculated as the ratio of the risk estimate over the zvalue corresponding to the reported pvalue in cases where a study did not provide a confidence interval or a pvalue for the risk estimate in question but gave the number of the observed and the expected number of cases the confidence interval was calculated using the byars method rothman et al 1979 therefore studies which reported a zero confidence interval demers et al 1994 ma et la 2005 were not estimable with respect to obtaining a summary risk estimate using the review manager software when calculating the overall risk estimate the betweenstudy variation was accounted for with the use of a randomeffects model which is based on the assumption that different studies are estimating different yet related exposure effects fleiss 1993 dersimonian and laird 1986 heterogeneity was examined using the q statistic cochrans q the chisquare statistic for the test of heterogeneity i2 measure of inconsistency as well as the galbraith plot for graphical exploration of outliers the i2 statistic is defined as qdfq x 100 where q is the χ2 test statistic and df denotes the corresponding degrees of freedom higgins and thompson 2002 a pvalue  01 was considered significant for testing for heterogeneity using the q testpublication bias or the possibility that unpublished data would contradict the results of published studies is always a potential source of bias in metaanalyses we checked the extent of publication bias using funnel plots begg and berlin 1988 examining them for signs of asymmetry as well as by using egger tests egger et al 1997 the funnel plots for evaluating publication bias for different cancer sites in our investigation are shown in appendix b sensitivity analysis for assessing the influence of individual studies on the summary risk estimate was performed by metaregression using metaregression we computed metaanalysis estimates by omitting one study at a time to track trends over time a cumulative metaanalysis was used in cumulative metaanalyses studies were added one at a time with the sequence determined by their year of publication in order to examine the cumulative effect on the pooled risk estimate as each article was added all these tests for heterogeneity publication bias metaregression and cumulative metaanalysis were applied to good and adequate studies only for each cancer siteresultsof the 49 studies included in the metaanalysis twentysix were cohort studies seventeen were casecontrol and six were surveillance studies or had some other study design twentytwo studies were conducted in the united states seven in canada four in new zealand two in australia and the remainder in european countries most of the studies were published after 1990 however the studies covered firefighters who worked mostly in the decades before 1990 the reference population was the corresponding general population of each study region in most of the studies the majority of the studies relied on death certificates for assessing cancer diagnosis and exposure information was mostly ascertained from employment records recently published and newly added studies not utilized in previous metaanalytic and qualitative reviews comprised of about 20 of all studies used in our current metaanalysis in figure 1 we describe the study selection process that led to the final articles included in the metaanalysis besides the 41studies originally selected eight studies that became available during the period of the internalexternal review and met inclusion criteria were added in the revised reportthe pooled estimates and 95 confidence intervals for both cancer incidence and cancer mortality for each specific cancer examined are presented in tables 1 2 and 3 forest plots for each specific cancer site are summarized in appendix c while in appendix d we present a comparison of our results with those of other previous qualitative and quantitative reviews as shown in appendix b the vast majority of evaluation did not reveal any significant publication bias for the studies used in assessing the association for different cancer sites an indication of publication bias was only seen for the studies related to colon cancer appendix b page 4 there was also some marginal indication for publication bias for studies examining rectal cancer pvalues for beggs and egger tests p  010 and p  007 respectively although tests for leukemia nonhodgkins lymphoma and liver and gallbladder cancer did not reach statistical significance beggs test p  010 and eggers test p  009 the number of studies examined were not enough to arrive at a final conclusion with respect to publication bias in table 1 we present the results for those cancers with statistically significant findings that are consistent with previous reports examining both incidence and mortality when all studies were examined for each specific cancer site risk estimates for cancer of the brain and central nervous system 126 95 ci 106  150 skin melanoma 134 95 ci 109  165 colorectal cancer 113 95 ci 106  121 and bladder cancer 118 95 ci 101  136 showed statistically significant associations with firefighting for both incidence and mortality p005 it is notable that the association of firefighting with colorectal cancer was statistically significant for all three categories of studies examined good studies only good and adequate studies all studies together in addition nonhodgkins lymphoma prostate cancer and testicular cancer were highly statistically significant firefighters had a 37 higher risk of developing and or dying from nonhodgkins lymphoma 137 95 ci 114  164 when all studies on this malignancy were pooled together p0001 similarly firefighters had a 26 increased risk for prostate cancer 126 95 ci 110  145 and 68 increased risk for testicular cancer 168 95 ci 135  208 respectively p0001 in addition findings for cancers that showed some statistically significant associations with firefighting are presented in table 2 risk estimates for leukemia 119 95 ci 104  136 multiple myeloma 128 95 ci 103  158 and pancreatic cancers 114 95 ci 101  128 showed statistically significant associations with firefighting only for the outcome of mortality and only when all studies regardless of being good or of adequate quality were included in the regression analyses ten studies were identified that addressed hodgkins lymphoma incidence andor mortality within a total of 10 studies 5 studies were judged to be of good or adequate quality the five poor quality studies used pmr as an outcome measure and were based on a small number of cases hodgkins lymphoma showed statistically significant increased risk estimates for both mortality 180 95 ci 127  256 and the combined outcome of incidence and mortality 151 95 ci 113  202 only when all studies were pooled together similarly kidney cancer showed statistically significant increased risk for mortality 129 95 ci 106  157 and for the combined outcome of incidence and mortality 125 95 ci 102  153 in table 3 we summarize the results for all other cancers examined oral and pharyngeal laryngeal lung esophageal stomach liver and gallbladder lymphatic and hematopoietic urinary and skin cancer for which we did not find any statistically significant relationship in association with firefightingdiscussionwe conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis examining the association of firefighting with different cancers furthermore we broadened the scope of our study by including the evaluation of doseresponse relationships duration of employment a crude proxy of cumulative exposures as well as a qualitative assessment of the possible impact of changes in personal protective equipment for the periods pre and post1990 we found an increased risk of mortality for brain and cns cancer and an increased risk of mortality for nonhodgkins lymphoma and skin melanoma associated with firefighting more consistent increased risks for both cancer incidence and cancer mortality among firefighters were observed for colorectal cancer as well as for colon and rectal cancer separately and for prostate and testicular cancer suggestive findings for an increased risk of mortality in association with firefighting were seen in leukemia hodgkins lymphoma lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma multiple myeloma as well as for kidney and pancreatic cancers for all other cancers examined oral and pharyngeal laryngeal lung esophageal stomach liver and gallbladder lymphatic and hematopoietic urinary and skin cancer we did not find any statistically significant association with firefighting in general our statistical results are consistent with other quantitative estimates and the majority of previous reports multiple myeloma skin melanoma and testicular cancer have been less widely studied compared to other cancers in the context of firefighting however some statistically significant results were found in our study and are consistent with the findings of lemasters et al 2006 similar significant and consistent findings were also seen for prostate cancer and nonhodgkins lymphoma there are several reasons that some of our results may differ from those of previous reports first the studies included in our review compared to previous metaanalyses were not identical in general because ours is the latest report we had the opportunity to collect more underlying component studies including recently published and newly added studies  about 20 of all studies used in our current metaanalysis not previously examined by other reviews we further applied finer inclusion  exclusion criteria and thus excluded certain weaker studies used by others in addition the exact metaanalytic methodology was not always the same across all reports for example as youakim 2006 reported in his work he used a fixedeffects model while we used a randomeffects model because we used a specific number of studies with a given heterogeneity among them finally differences in the results for incidence and mortality likely relate to other various factors such as the number of studies hence cancer cases and power available for each endpoint generally more studies examined mortality than incidence and the lethality of the cancer eg most persons are expected to survive testicular cancerit is important to note that most of the individual component studies used in our study as well as in previous metaanalyses examined primarily firefighters who worked prior to 1990 which severely limited our efforts to compare cancer trends before and after the introduction of improved personal protective equipment see below additionally sufficient latency periods may not have been examined in component studies of post1990 firefighters in examining the potential impact of firefighting duties and more specifically in assessing the possible association of different workplace exposures of firefighters with the development of different tumors one should take into account the evolving nature of firefighting duties over time and specifically during the past couple of decades as we have been able to ascertain based on the examined literature over the past few decades a number of studies have examined the association between firefighting exposures and risk of cancer in parallel with other studies reporting on the characteristics and the nature of firefighters workplace exposures in order to evaluate the impact of published studies looking at the risk of cancer among firefighters in association with workrelated hazards we need to take into account a number of specific parameters such factors include the intensity of acute exposures associated with firefighting duties peak exposure values and the type and duration of different exposures as well as the frequency of exposure in order to evaluate a cumulative measure of exposure over time furthermore we need to consider changes in personal protective equipment that might have affected the current levels of exposure in comparison to those reported in previously published studies in addition other significant parameters that merit consideration include the latency period between exposure and outcome changes in firefighters duties and secular generational changes the most significant development in the recent history of firefighting has been the gradually increasing and now widespread use of the positive pressure self contained breathing apparatus scba by firefighters this respirator has contributed to a significant decrease of smoke exposure during fire suppression operations in addition current significantly lower exposure levels of firefighters especially during fire suppression operations reflect not only on the use of improved personal protective equipment such as scba but also on the decreasing number of structural fires overall suggesting that there is not only a marked decrease in peak exposures during fires but also a decrease in cumulative exposures as a direct effect of the decreasing number of fires on the other hand despite the use of scba during active fire suppression burgess et al 2001 reported recently that firefighters who participate in overhaul operations and do not use scba or other respirators exhibit acute adverse respiratory changes such repeated exposures may have other cumulative effects over time potentially contributing to longterm adverse health effects including cancer scba is usually not worn during overhaul and although other respirators are indicated it is not always standard practice to use them furthermore we should consider that during brush and forest fires firefighters tend to have an increased risk of pulmonary sequelae compared to those associated with structural firefighting this discrepancy is more likely the result of decreased use  decreased level of respiratory protection in these workers than from differences in the constituents of the fire smoke to which they are exposed harrison et al 1995 nevertheless the vast majority of studies used in the current metaanalyses do not involve forest firefighters and therefore may not reflect the exposures and risks experienced by that specific subgroup of firefighting professionalsthe scope of firefighters duties has also been modified over time especially during the last two decades firefighters are being called upon to fulfill several additional duties including the expanding nature of emergency preparedness training hazardous materials teams emergency medical services as well as several other public safety duties such a changing work pattern for firefighters may inevitably influence the type of workrelated exposures and outcomes associated with the occupation of firefighting in the future it is also worth noting that several recent studies have documented or estimated the time spent on different duties by firefighters kales et al 2003 kales et al 2007 and the results clearly show that fire suppression operations do not exceed at most 5 of the overall annual duties of firefighters austin et al 2001 similarly the time spent on nonfire emergency duties appears to be relatively high approximately 25 for example about 90 of emergency calls according to the national fire protection association nfpa involve nonfire emergencies primarily the provision of emergency medical services the estimated time spent for nonemergency fire station duties is even higher approximately 50 in contrast to the general public notion that firefighters spend most of their time directly in firerelated duties nfpa 2007the metaanalytic data in our report thus examine firefighters who may have had different exposure experiences compared to the current younger generations of firefighters therefore in summary we believe that the level and frequency of firesuppression related exposures for firefighters peak and cumulative exposures have gradually and significantly been reduced over the past couple of decades mainly due to the use of effective personal protective equipment and the reduction of fire suppression operations overall in addition we note that the results of the current existing literature on the association of workplace exposures with the risk of cancer in firefighters may not adequately reflect on the period marked by the consistent use of the positive pressure scba which has led to the improvement of firefighters exposure profile the studies available characterize primarily firefighters who worked mostly between the 1940s to 1980s thus even though there are several risk estimates providing evidence of an increased risk of specific cancers in firefighters and some of these results are statistically significant we advise caution with respect to automatically adjudicating or presuming causation between firefighting and certain cancers among todays firefighters by directly generalizing our results based primarily on previous generations of firefightersfurthermore we would like to point out additional limitations of our metaanalysis which refer to the combination of personal risk factors for specific cancers including the family history of firefighters that for the most part were not controlled for in these studies a related limitation of the present study refers to a number of relevant secular and generational trends observed during the past two decades which may be associated with the risk of cancer in firefighters and should also be considered such parameters include the changing pattern of established cancer risk factors such as tobacco smoking diet and obesity among the community of firefighters and the society at large important changes in the above risk factors have been repeatedly documented over time within the general population thereby inevitably affecting the status of the above factors among firefighters as well soteriades et al 2002 soteriades et al 2005 for example many fire departments now prohibit the hiring of firefighters who are smokers in consideration of presumption legislation associating firefighting duties with the development of heart and lung disease being considered as occupational illnesses moreover north americans in general are smoking less on the other hand the prevalence of obesity adversely linked with several cancers has been gradually and steadily increasing in western society and among firefighters providing a mixed cancer risk factor profile finally regarding secular trends our study cannot adjust for improvements in cancer screening accuracy of diagnosis and treatment as all of the above factors change andor improve over time it would be important in the future to focus on incidence studies of a prospective nature in order to evaluate the current levels and quality of exposures in firefighters as delineated above another factor worth mentioning is that we cannot account for the fact that many career firefighters hold second jobs in some cases these jobs are in various trades few if any studies of firefighters have collected systematic information on second jobs and other potential exposures thus there is insufficient information to comment as to how if at all this might affect the existing body of evidence associating firefighting with the risk of different cancersfurthermore several other limitations related to the available data call for caution in making firm conclusions regarding causality most of the limitations are associated with the original studies used in the metaanalysis such weaknesses include the small number of observed cases the limited data to assess doseresponse relationships the limited or absent information on potential confounders among firefighters eg personal risk factors smoking and second jobs with respect to the pooled estimates and the absence of specific individual exposure data for firefighters finally there are concerns regarding the different segments of the population used as reference  comparison groups in each individual study that was included in the pooled estimates of the current metaanalysis for example some studies compared firefighters to the general population while others used a more limited group or even other specific occupational groups such as police officers in conclusion our results regarding a positive association of firefighting with brain and cns cancer bladder and colorectal cancers colon and rectal considered separately are consistent with several previous summary risk estimates andor qualitative conclusions with regard to bladder cancer the overall body of evidence supports a statistical increase in mortality and based on a smaller number of studies also suggests an increase in incidence for brain and cns cancers a consistently suggestive pattern has been shown for increased mortality regarding colorectal cancer a consistently suggestive pattern of increased risk of mortality was found along with other reviews including colon and rectal cancers considered separately in addition we found statistically significant or suggestive results for nonhodgkins lymphoma skin melanoma prostate and testicular cancer for leukemia hodgkins lymphoma lymphosarcoma and reticulosarcoma multiple myeloma pancreatic and kidney cancer we found some statistically significant but less consistent findings for the remaining cancers evaluated oral and pharyngeal laryngeal lung esophageal stomach liver and gallbladder lymphatic and hematopoietic urinary and combined skin cancer we did not find any statistical evidence of an increased risk of cancer incidence andor mortality for firefightersalthough our metaanalysis showed statistically significant increased risks of either cancer incidence or mortality for certain cancers in association with firefighting a number of important limitations of the underlying studies exist which precluded our ability to arrive at definitive conclusions regarding causation the metaanalytic results are based primarily on observational studies from previous generations of firefighters either lacking or with only crude exposure  dose estimates moreover personal risk factors eg smoking for specific cancers were not controlled in the original studies and could not be adjusted for in our metaanalysisopen in a separate windowfigure 1study selection processtable 1pooled estimates for the association of

objectives to update the mortality experience of a previously studied cohort of 29 992 us urban career firefighters compared with the us general population and examine exposureresponse relationships within the cohort methods vital status was updated through 2016 adding 7 years of followup cohort mortality compared with the us population was evaluated via life table analyses full risksets matched on attained age race birthdate and fire department were created and analysed using the cox proportional hazards regression to examine exposureresponse associations between select mortality outcomes and exposure surrogates exposeddays fireruns and firehours models were adjusted for a potential bias from healthy worker survivor effects by including a categorical variable for employment duration results compared with the us population mortality from all cancers mesothelioma nonhodgkins lymphoma nhl and cancers of the oesophagus intestine rectum lung and kidney were modestly elevated positive exposureresponse relationships were observed for deaths from lung cancer leukaemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd conclusions this update confirms previous findings of excess mortality from all cancers and several sitespecific cancers as well as positive exposureresponse relations for lung cancer and leukaemia new findings include excess nhl mortality compared with the general

healthy subjects participating in a course to become firefighters while wearing personal protective equipment ppe the exposure period consisted of a 3day training course where the subjects participated in various livefire training exercises the subjects were instructed to extinguish fires of either wood or wood with electrical cords and mattresses the personal exposure was measured as dermal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah concentrations and urinary excretion of 1hydroxypyrene 1ohp the subjects were primarily exposed to particulate matter pm in bystander positions since the selfcontained breathing apparatus effectively prevented pulmonary exposure there was increased dermal exposure to pyrene 681 95 ci 525 838 and sum of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ʃpah 795 95 ci 525 1066 and increased urinary excretion of 1ohp 704 95 ci 525 1066 after the firefighting exercise compared with the mean of two control measurements performed 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the firefighting course respectively the level of fpgsensitive sites in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmcs was increased by 80 95 ci 002 159 compared with control measurements the level of dna strand breaks was positively associated with dermal exposure to pyrene and ʃpahs and urinary excretion of 1ohp fpgsensitive sites were only associated positively with pahs biomarkers of inflammation

biomass smoke has mostly been assessed by personal monitoring to airborne pollutants however the use of biomarkers may accurately reflect the internal systemic dose received by the firefighter in this study we assessed occupational exposure to wildland fire smoke in 14 wildland firefighters working at prescribed burns at the savannah river site south carolina by measuring the urinary concentrations of nine hydroxylated metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ohpahs except for 1hydroxynaphthalene preshift median concentrations of the ohpahs were higher compared with the median concentrations reported among the us general population indicating elevated exposures to pahs among the wildland firefighters during the prescribed burn season the postshift concentrations of ohpahs were 83323 p00001 higher compared with the preshift concentrations higher postshift concentrations of individual ohpahs were observed in 49 875 to 53 946 of all the 56 prepost sample pairs additionally the crossshift pre to postshift increase in 4hydroxyphenanthrene urinary concentration was marginally associated p01 with work shift exposure to pm25 and significantly associated p005 with levoglucosan which is a marker of wildland fire or vegetative biomass smoke these results suggest that ohpahs especially 4phe may be useful biomarkers of wildland fire smoke exposurekeywords biomarker biomonitoring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons vegetative biomass smoke wildland fire smoke wildland firefightersintroductionsmoke resulting from the combustion of vegetation biomass is a significant source of air pollution in indoor and outdoor environments exposure to vegetative biomass smoke is common in rural communities in developing countries where most of the estimated 3 billion people who rely on biomass fuels for their residential energy supply live1 wood is one of the more common fuels that is combusted in these communities1 however combustion of wood or vegetation biomass is also an important contributor to air pollution in temperate regions of developed countries where wood is a major source of energy for household heating during the winter28 acute wood or vegetative biomass smoke exposure may also occur on a large scale from wildfires910 wildland firefighters are occupationally exposed to air pollutants while working to combat wildfires or at prescribed burns prescribed burn is often applied as a land management tool to reduce the probability of wildfire occurrence1115vegetative biomass smoke exposure may have significant adverse impact on health101618 vegetative biomass smoke contains many potentially harmful components including particulate matter pm carbon monoxide co formaldehyde acrolein benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs19 while exposure to wildland fire or vegetative biomass smoke including that of wildland firefighters has been most commonly measured by area measurements or personal monitoring of air concentrations of components eg co pm biological monitoring using a relevant biomarker could also be of interest the use of appropriate biomarkers is advantageous because they may be more specific to the exposure of concern and therefore may serve as more accurate measures of internal dose biological monitoring has been used to assess wildland fire smoke exposure in a few studies these include the assessment of occupational wildland firefighter wildland fire smoke exposure using exhaled co carboxyhemoglobin and urinary methoxyphenols and levoglucosan2023because pahs have been shown to increase in concentration in indoor and outdoor environments consequent upon the combustion of vegetation biomass2427 it may also be possible to use hydroxylated metabolites of pahs ohpahs for biological monitoring of wildland fire smoke exposure among wildland firefighters pahs may also be directly connected to the mechanisms through which wildland fire smoke particles induce toxicity through their ability to cause oxidative stress through the formation of oxygenatedpahs quinones2830ohpahs have been used in studies of exposure to and adverse effects of household air pollution resulting from vegetative biomass including wood smoke in developing countries3134 in the current study we used urinary ohpahs for biological monitoring of occupational wildland firefighters wildland fire smoke exposure we compared the concentrations of ohpahs in the wildland firefighters postshift urine samples and those in samples collected before their work shift at prescribed fires to determine whether their work shift wildland fire smoke exposure resulted in exposure to pahssubjects and methodsstudy location and subject recruitmentsavannah river site srs is a united states department of energy

resident crew of united states forest service wildland firefighters annually applies prescribed burns to  20000 acres of forest within srs to reduce forest fuel load and restore ecological processes35 a total of 19 17 males and 2 females wildland firefighters who worked at prescribed burns at srs participated in an exposure assessment study during the dormant winter seasons januarymarch of 2008 and 200913 no respiratory protection was worn by the subjects while they conducted prescribed burns as is currently typical of wildland firefighters11 the subjects were recruited into the study after the objectives of the study were explained to them and they had signed the study consent form the study was approved by the university of georgia institutional review board for the inclusion of human subjects the involvement of the centers for disease control and prevention cdc laboratory was determined not to constitute engagement in human subject researchpersonal exposures of the subjects to co and pm25 pm with median aerodynamic diameter of 25 μm were monitored across 30 prescribed burn work shifts spot preshift urine samples were collected for all sampled subjectwork shifts immediately before work at prescribed burns spot postshift samples were collected on the same day immediately after prescribed burn was completed for the current study 56 pre and postshift urine sample pairs from 14 subjects 12 males and 2 females working at 16 of the prescribed burn work shifts with an average duration of 76 h were identified for ohpah biomonitoring the urine sample pairs were selected based on the following criteria 1 they were collected from the wildland firefighters at prescribed burns occurring at least two days since they had last worked at a prescribed burn or wildfire and 2 they had corresponding personal pm25 exposure data additionally all but four of the urine sample pairs had corresponding pmassociated levoglucosan data and all but three had corresponding co exposure data the urine samples were coded after collection immediately frozen at 20 c on site and later shipped on dry ice to the cdc in atlanta and were stored at 70 c until analysispersonal pm25 levoglucosan and

sample preparation and 01 ml of 1 m sodium acetate buffer ph  55 containing βglucuronidasearylsulfatase enzyme from helix pomatia and ascorbic acid solution the mixture was then allowed to incubate at 37 c overnight which deconjugated the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of the pah metabolites present in urine and yielded free ohpahs the samples were spiked with 175 μl of methanol and centrifuged the supernatant of the sample mixture was diluted with 350 μl of deionized water before instrumental analysis analytical determination of the target analytes were performed by online solidphase extraction coupled with highperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry the instrumentation setup includes an ichrom symbiosis online solidphase extraction system an agilent 1260

length of work shift and tobacco smoking secondhand smoke shs exposure and grilled and smoked food consumption within the prior 48 h was obtained using a selfadministered questionnaire filled out by the subjects after each work shift a timeactivity diary was also filled out after each prescribed burn work shift and was used to record the task that the subjects performed while at the fire line tasks were classified according to the three main tasks performed at the fire line lighting holding or mopup if the subject had spent at least 75 of the time at the fire line performing the task lighting involves the ignition of the vegetative biomass fuel holding involves activities geared towards maintaining the fire within the boundaries of the area being burned mopup activities entail the extinguishing of smoldering fire after the fuel has been consumed tasks were categorized as unclassed when the wildland firefighters spent most of the time on other tasks or did not spend up to 75 of their time at the fire line performing any one taskstatistical analysisconcentrations of ohpahs below the limits of detection were replaced with the limits of detection divided by the square root of 237 creatinine correction the concentration of ohpah in urine divided by the concentration of creatinine in urine was applied to ohpah concentrations before they were used in statistical analyses to account for urine dilution linear mixedeffect models were first used to test whether the postshift creatininecorrected concentrations of the individual ohpahs and of their sum σohpahs were increased compared with the preshift concentrations the response variables in the models were the logtransformed urinary concentrations of the ohpahs whereas the predictor variable was the time of urine collection pre or postshift the possible effects of various factors on the crossshift differences postshift minus preshift concentrations in the logtransformed ohpah urinary concentrations were then individually tested using linear mixedeffect models these factors include the occurrence of shs exposure during the work shift the task that the subject performed most of the time at the fire line 75 consumption of grilled or smoked food within 48 h before sampling the size of burn the length of the work shift age and work shift exposures to co pm25 and levoglucosan the random subject effects were included in the models to control for correlations between multiple measurements collected from the same subject and random effects for the sample collection date were included to control for correlation between urinary ohpah concentrations in samples collected on the same dayall statistical analyses were performed using the sas version 93 sas institute cary nc usa the linear mixedeffect

postshift concentration of the urinary ohpah was significantly higher p00001 than the geometric mean preshift concentrationwork shift exposure to co and pm25 size of the prescribed burn length of work

adjustment for no other factor two of the subjects who had only a total of 3 subjectdays of samples reported being current smokers however only one of the subjects smoked once during the work shift when the urine samples were collected therefore the effect of smoking on the crossshift differences in ohpah concentrations was not tested subjects reported having shs exposures on 16 subjectdays subjects also reported eating smoked or grilled foods within the previous 48 h on eight occasions crossshift differences were higher for all ohpahs when the subjects were exposed to shs during the work shift and lower when they had eaten smoked or grilled foods within the previous 48 h however these differences were not statistically significant the relationship between age and crossshift differences in the ohpahs was inconsistent and largely insignificant a significant association with age was only observed for 1pyr with increasing crossshift difference 0029 log units with age p

relationship between crossshift differences in creatininecorrected 1nap concentration and work shift exposure to levoglucosan in a similar model however the marginal significance of these two relationships was not sustained when other factors were adjusted for in the modelsdiscussionthe average co concentration in the personal air sample of the firefighters who provided the urine samples used for the ohpah analyses 14 subjects 56 persondays is comparable to the average concentration observed across the entire study 18 subjects 157 persondays from which the samples were selected 13 versus 15 ppm respectively average personal air sample concentrations of pm25 577 versus 530 μgm3 and levoglucosan 21 versus 20 μgm3 were also comparable between the two groups13 the personal air sample concentrations of co and pm25 were also within the range of levels observed during a previous wildland firefighter exposure study at srs12 and comparable to timeweighted averages recorded in studies in the western united states11the substantial and significant higher postshift creatininecorrected urine concentrations of the nine ohpahs 183 to 423fold increase compared with the preshift concentrations in the current study suggest that the occupational exposure of the wildland firefighters at prescribed burns to elevated levels of wildland fire smoke as demonstrated by their work shift personal exposures to pm25 contributed to their pah exposures concentrations of most of the ohpahs were at least doubled across the work shift except 1pyr 183fold increase this could be expected because emissions of pahs from wood combustion are relatively high compared with those from less clean fuel such as coal briquette and kerosene3839 woodvegetative biomass combustion has also been identified as a major source of atmospheric pahs4041 and is a dominant contributor to the ambient air concentrations of pm and pahs in certain areas in developed countries where wood is a major heating fuel282526 furthermore it has been shown in studies that pah content is higher in wood smoke particles compared with particles from other common sources of ambient air pollution such as traffic and diesel exhaust4243although 1pyr had been commonly used as a biomarker of pah exposure it had the least percentage increase 83 among the nine ohpahs that were examined in the current study the largest percentage increase 323 from pre to postshift was observed for 1nap pre to postshift increases above 200 were also observed for 4phe 265 3phe 255 and 2flu 201 similarly 2nap had been observed to be more sensitive to exposure to vegetative biomass smoke compared with 1pyr among charcoal production workers in brazil44 there was a 198 increase in 2nap in the current study the significant association that was observed between crossshift changes in 4phe and work shift levoglucosan exposure in both the simple and more complex models also supports the observation that other ohpahs may be more appropriate as biomarkers of wildland fire or vegetative biomass smoke exposure compared with 1pyr although the effects of shs exposure during the work shift increased crossshift changes and consumption of smoked andor grilled food within the prior 48 h decreased crossshift changes were in the expected direction45 their associations with the changes in ohpahs were not significant additionally controlling for them and other factors did not change the association between 4phe and levoglucosan exposureconsequently biomonitoring as assessed in the current study could serve as an alternative approach for evaluating occupational wildland fire smoke exposure of the wildland firefighter instead of personal air monitoring as was mostly carried out in previous studies1115 unlike in the current study previous use of urinary ohpahs for biomonitoring vegetative biomass smoke exposure has mainly been within the context of chronic exposure to elevated levels of wood smoke in indoor environments andor interventions to reduce such exposures313334 urinary concentrations of 2nap and 1pyr have also been used to assess wood smoke exposure among workers in a charcoal production plant44although substantial pre to postshift increases in the ohpahs levels among the subjects indicated occupational pah exposure it should be noted that wildland firefighters are potentially exposed to other sources of pahs apart from wildland fire smoke at prescribed burns however the median preshift creatininecorrected concentrations of ohpahs except 1nap appear higher compared with the median concentrations figures 13 observed for the united states adult population 20 years in the 20072008 20052006 for 4phe national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes46 additionally the median preshift creatininecorrected concentrations of 1pyr 1phe 2phe and 3phe were all apparently higher compared with the 75th percentile concentrations for the united states adult population and median concentrations among adult 2049 years smokers in the united states46 the median postshift ohpah concentrations exceeded the 95th percentile of concentrations of hydroxylated phenanthrene except 4phe 90th percentile and pyrene metabolites observed in the general population in the survey46 these results indicate that the subjects pah exposures during the prescribed burn seasons when the samples were collected were above the average exposures of the general population in the countryopen in a separate windowfigure 1comparison of geometric mean pre and postshift

apart from wildland fire smoke for the wildland firefighter at prescribed burns include vehicle exhaust and the lighting fuel 1 part gasoline to 3 parts of diesel mixture used to ignite the biomass however it is not expected that these would have affected the overall results regarding the higher postshift creatininecorrected concentrations of ohpahs emissions from these sources are small compared with those from the combustion of biomass at prescribed burns and crossshift changes in the ohpahs were not different between the firefighters who were lighting with the gasolinediesel lighting fuel and those performing other tasks cigarette smoke is also a source of pahs45 however cigarette was smoked by one subject during the work shift only once throughout the study period and exposure to shs during the work shift was associated with an insignificant higher crossshift increases in the urinary ohpahs it should be noted that the insignificance of this result could have been due to the small sample size of the studyother possible sources of exposure away from work including the use of wood for heating at homes and dietary sources could also have affected the results2445 however only one of the subjects reported using wood as an energy source for residential heating and so this variable was not controlled for during statistical analyses consumption of grilled or smoked food within the previous 48 h did not have any effect on crossshift differences in urinary ohpah concentrations moreover unreported exposure to such sources would have likely biased the results towards the null as they would have likely contributed towards an increase in the preshift measurements and a reduction in crossshift increases in the ohpahs furthermore the significant pre to postshift increases in ohpahs were consistent with higher postshift creatininecorrected concentrations of the analytes being observed in 49 875 to 53 946 of the 56 subjectdays of measurements table 1 the collection of spot urine immediately after the work shift at prescribed burns can also be viewed as a limitation of the study since peak excretion of ohpahs in urine occurs a few hours after exposure the average time of maximum excretion of the ohpahs that were measured in this study occurred 46 to 83 h after experimental exposure to wood smoke47 nonetheless timing spot urine collection to match peak excretion would have rather strengthened the results observed in this studyin conclusion there were consistent substantial increases in ohpahs across prescribed burn work shifts among the wildland firefighters in this study additionally crossshift changes in creatininecorrected 4phe was associated with personal exposure to airborne pollution significantly with levoglucosan and marginally with pm25 the results suggest that ohpahs especially 4phe may be applicable as biomarkers of wildland fire or vegetative biomass smoke exposure in elevated exposure situations in environments with relatively low background pah levels open in a separate windowfigure 2comparison of geometric mean pre and postshift creatininecorrected hydroxylfluorene and pyrene metabolite

evaluated in firefightersmethodsblood from 52 incumbent and 45 new recruit nonsmoking firefighters was analyzed for microrna expression and the results adjusted for age obesity ethnicity and multiple comparisonsresultsnine micrornas were identified with at least a 15fold significant difference between groups all six micrornas with decreased expression in incumbent firefighters have been reported to have tumor suppressor activity or are associated with cancer survival and two of the three micrornas with increased expression in incumbent firefighters have activities consistent with cancer promotion with the remaining microrna associated with neurological diseaseconclusionincumbent firefighters showed differential microrna expression compared with new recruits providing potential mechanisms for increased cancer risk in firefighterskeywords firefighter cancer micrornacancer is a leading cause of death among firefighters in the united states in a recent large study overall cancer incidence and mortality among firefighters were 9 and 14 higher than the general public respectively with increased mortality rates of 30 or more for mesothelioma and cancers of the esophagus intestine and rectum1 in addition elevated incidence andor mortality have been reported in firefighters for cancers of the bladder kidney lung prostate skin melanoma and nonmelanoma stomach and testes as well as leukemia multiple myeloma and nonhodgkin lymphoma17firefighters are occupationally exposed to carcinogens and other toxicants including benzene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons formaldehyde arsenic 13 butadiene cadmium chromium compounds asbestos flame retardants and particulates5812 furthermore most firefighters work prolonged shifts associated with sleep disruption and shiftwork with circadian disruption has been classified as a probable human carcinogen group 2a by the international agency for research on cancer iarc1113while exposure to carcinogens and elevated cancer risk have been well established for firefighters there is limited information on the cellular mechanisms involved greater understanding of these mechanisms is critical to identify potentially reversible cellular changes before the development of cancer and to help determine causation with regard to firefighter workers compensation cancer claims based in part on the lack of data regarding mechanistic changes in firefighters leading to carcinogenesis in 2010 the iarc classified occupational exposures to firefighters as only possibly carcinogenic to humans group 2b despite multiple epidemiologic studies demonstrating elevated cancer incidence rates in firefighters1113epigenetic changes including histone modifications dna methylation and microrna mirna mediated pathways play prominent roles in carcinogenesis and cancer prevention and have been associated with activation of oncogenes or inhibition of tumor suppressor genes1415 mirnas are small 18 to 22 nucleotide noncoding rnas involved in regulating cell cycle progression apoptosis and differentiation some mirnas act as oncogenes by inducing oncogene expression or tumorsuppressor genes through regulation of dna methylation and histone modification these epigenetic changes serve as molecular biomarkers of environmental exposures and carcinogenesis1619we hypothesized that occupational exposures in firefighters would lead to changes in mirna expression associated with activation of cancer pathways and increased cancer risk as a first step in testing this hypothesis we designed this study to compare mirnas in incumbent firefighters and new recruitsmethodsthis study was a part of larger firefighter cancer prevention study working in partnership with the tucson fire department all study protocols were approved by the university of arizona institutional review board approval no 1509137073 to identify epigenetic changes associated with occupational carcinogen exposures in firefighters we recruited newly employed new recruit firefighters before occupational exposure to fire and smoke and incumbent firefighters after receiving a detailed explanation of the study design and potential risks all subjects provided written informed consent we surveyed general characteristics using questionnaires to collect information regarding age body weight height working duration as firefighters and tobacco use body mass

the study subjects consisted of 55 male recruits and 117 male incumbents who had completed baseline blood sampling one recruit was excluded because of an inadequate blood draw the 54 remaining recruits were then matched by raceethnicity to 54 incumbents for sample processing for a total of 108 subjects one recruit sample was not adequate for mirna analysis and five subjects four recruits

reaction was hybridized with the human mirna code set nanostring technologies part csomir312 at 65c overnight purification and binding of the hybridized probes to the optical cartridge were performed on the ncounter prep station and the cartridge scanned on the ncounter digital analyzer nanostring technologies inc seattle washington raw counts from each gene were normalized against background genes and overall assay performance was assessed through evaluation of builtin positive controlsfor comparison of age and bmi between recruits and incumbents the chisquare test was used the mean comparisons of age and bmi were done by the student t test to evaluate the correlation between age and working duration as a firefighter pearson correlation was used these statistical analyses were performed using r version 341 mirnas sites with mean counts that were less than 2 were filtered leaving 821 genes for analysis filtered mirnas raw counts were first transformed and quantile normalized by voom package20 in preparation for linear modeling and then analyzed by the limma package21 a linear model with empirical bayes estimator was adopted22 with adjustment for age ethnicity and bmi probes were considered to be differentially expressed if the resulting p value was less than 005m applying bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons the corresponding gene list was derived from the gene annotations associated with the probesboth kmeans clustering and hierarchical clustering using the factoextra package in r 341 were used to discover mirna clusters discriminating between the incumbent and new recruit groups both analyses were restricted to mirnas differentially expressed between the two groups adjusted for age bmi and ethnicity with p values less than 005 the optimal

increased in service members with polychlorinated dibenzodioxin pcdd and polychlorinated dibenzofuran pcdf exposures from open air burn pits comparing pre and postdeployment60 however to evaluate for doseresponse relationships specific to firefighters longitudinal studies including exposure assessment and measurement of mirna changes are neededcluster analysis comparing the incumbent firefighters to new recruits identified mirna groupings associated with stem cells inflammation cytokinecytokine receptor interactions cell adhesion molecules cancers and a number of target genes mirnas control stem cell selfrenewal and differentiation61 and through this role have been implicated in the etiology of a variety of cancers6263 for example hsamir302a3p and hsamir302b3p enriched in cluster 1 and hsamir302d3p enriched in cluster 2 belong to the mir302 family which has important roles relative to stem cells64 mir302 inhibits human pluripotent stem cell tumorigenicity by enhancing multiple g1 phase arrest pathways65 moreover the mir302 family functions to reprogram skin cancer cells into a stem celllike pluripotent state66 mir137 enriched in cluster 2 is downregulated in colon cancer stem cells compared with normal colon stem cells67 mir124 and 137 also regulate the differentiation and proliferation of neural stem cells and glioblastomamultiforme tumor cells68beyond stem cells all three pathways identified in cluster 1 were related to inflammation chronic inflammation has long been linked with cancers69 inflammation mediated by the chemokine and cytokine signaling pathway typeentrezproteinattrstextp00031term_id124076972term_textp00031p00031 includes chemokineinduced adhesion and migration of leukocytes7071 and mirnas differentially expressed in lung cancer7273 bladder cancer74 senescence and aging75 the cytokinecytokine receptor interaction pathway ccri hsa04060 is a large pathway that includes 270 related genes76 cytokines that act through receptors are released in response to infection inflammation and immunity and cytokines and cytokine receptors can function to inhibit tumor development and progression cancer cells also respond to hostderived cytokines that promote growth attenuate apoptosis and facilitate invasion and metastasis7778 cell adhesion molecules cams hsa04514 constituting the third pathway play a critical role in a wide array of biologic processes including immune response and inflammation contributing to cancer development7981the third cluster identified in our analyses included specific cancer types and genes of the 19 mirnas enriched in carcinomas three of them were from the mirna let7 family and are reported to be downregulated in human lung carcinomas where reduced let7 expression is associated with a poor cancer prognosis82 also among these 19 mirnas mir21 and mir181 are potential diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for nonsmall cell lung cancer83 and mir106 and mir93 are expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma84 the enriched let7 family in cluster 3 targets 10 genes and let7 is highly conserved in human organs and associated with colon adenocarcinoma kidney renal clear cell carcinoma esophageal carcinoma lung squamous cell carcinoma and liver hepatocellular carcinoma among others23 specifically csnk2a1 ip07 and dhx9 are coexpressed in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma24our study has a number of limitations the number of firefighter participants was limited and crosssectional in nature and larger prospective longitudinal studies are needed to validate the epigenetic changes observed although we adjusted for age there were only a limited number of new recruits older than 40 years of age and similarly only a limited number of incumbent firefighters less than 30 years old we did not validate the mirna findings using a second technique given the strong correlation reported among multiple mirna platforms including nanostring85 although we did not have complete information on toxic exposures outside of firefighting previous use of cigarettes was lower in the incumbent firefighters so we do not believe that this past exposure could explain the mirna findings we were not able to adjust for other potential confounders due to incomplete responses to survey questions such as but not limited to diet and exercise additional studies in other geographic regions are also needed to determine whether the results of our study are generalizable to firefighters elsewherein conclusion this study identified multiple mirnas with significantly different expression levels comparing incumbent firefighters with new recruits these findings suggest potential mechanisms for development of cancer in firefightersfootnoteskyoung sook jeong and jin zhou

building materials methods a casecontrol study using california cancer registry data 19882007 was conducted to evaluate the risk of cancer among firefighters stratified by race results this study identified 3996 male firefighters with cancer firefighters were found to have a significantly elevated risk for melanoma odds ratio 1421 multiple myeloma or 14 95ci 1018 acute myeloid leukemia or 14 95ci 1020 and cancers of the esophagus or 16 95ci 1221 prostate or 15 95ci 1317 brain or 15 95ci 1220 and kidney or 13 95ci 1016 conclusions in addition to observing cancer findings consistent with previous research this study generated novel findings for firefighters with raceethnicity other than white it provides additional evidence to support the association between firefighting and several

us career firefighters methods eight cancer and four noncancer outcomes were examined using conditional logistic regression incidence density sampling was used to match each case to 200 controls on attained age days accrued in firefighting assignments exposeddays run totals fireruns and run times firehours were used as exposure surrogates hrs comparing 75th and 25th centiles of lagged cumulative exposures were calculated using loglinear linear logquadratic power and restricted cubic spline general relative risk models piecewise constant models were used to examine risk differences by time since exposure age at exposure and calendar period results among 19309 male firefighters eligible for the study there were 1333 cancer deaths and 2609 cancer incidence cases significant positive associations between firehours and lung cancer mortality and incidence were evident a similar relation between leukaemia mortality and fireruns was also found the lung cancer associations were nearly linear in cumulative exposure while the association with leukaemia mortality was attenuated at higher exposure levels and greater for recent exposures significant negative associations were evident for the exposure surrogates and colorectal and prostate cancers suggesting a healthy worker survivor effect possibly enhanced by medical screening conclusions lung cancer and leukaemia mortality risks were modestly increasing with firefighter exposures these findings add to evidence of a causal association between firefighting and cancer nevertheless small effects merit cautious interpretation we

about possible health effects of fire training practices at an australian training facility recommended a study to investigate the risk of cancer and mortality of those with risk of chronic occupational exposure to several chemicals aims to investigate mortality and cancer incidence in firefighters at the country fire authority cfa fiskville training facility victoria australia between 1971 and 1999 methods cfa supplied human resources records supplemented by selfreported information for a retrospective cohort and allocated firefighters to low medium or high groups based on probability of exposure we linked the cohort to state and national cancer and mortality data we calculated standardized mortality ratios and standardized cancer incidence ratios sirs results the high group n  95 had a clearly increased risk of overall cancers sir  185 95 ci 120273 testicular cancer sir  119 144429 and melanoma sir  459 168999 relative to the population of victoria brain cancer was significantly increased for the medium group n  256 sir  574 156147 mortality was significantly reduced for all groups conclusions dealing with supplied records can be problematic but despite the small numbers we identified an increased risk of cancer for the high group the mortality data suggested that there was underascertainment for the medium and low groups which underestimated risk and a possible reporting bias for brain cancer small cohorts can still provide statistically significant findings when investigating locations for cancer risk keywords cancer incidence cohort

citedisplay options display options format abstractpubmedpmid abstract background firefighters are at increased risk for select cancers however many studies are limited by relatively small samples with virtually no data on the cancer experience of female firefighters this study examines cancer risk in over 100000 career florida firefighters including 5000  females assessed over a 34year period methods florida firefighter employment records n  109 009 were linked with florida cancer data system registry data 19812014 33 million records identifying 3760 male and 168 femalelinked primary cancers genderspecific age and calendar yearadjusted odds ratios aor and 95 confidence intervals for firefighters vs nonfirefighters were calculated results male firefighters were at increased risk of melanoma aor  156 139176 prostate 136 127146 testicular 166 134206 thyroid 217 178266 and latestage colon cancer 119100141 female firefighters showed significantly elevated risk of brain 254 119542 and thyroid 242 156374 cancers and an elevated risk of melanoma that approached statistical significance 168 097290 among male firefighters there was additional evidence of increased cancer risk younger than the age of 50 vs 50 years and older for thyroid 255 196331 vs 169 122234 prostate 188 149236 vs 136 126147 testicular 160 128201 vs 147 073294 and melanoma 187 155226 vs 142 122166 cancers conclusion male career firefighters in florida are at increased risk for five cancers with typically stronger associations in those diagnosed younger than the age of 50 while there was evidence for increased thyroid and brain cancer and possibly melanoma risk in female firefighters larger cohorts with adequate female representation along with the collection of wellcharacterized exposure histories are needed to more precisely examine cancer risk in this occupational group keywords florida cancer registry cancer risk firefighters occupation  2020 wiley periodicals inc pubmed

the united states and illustrate the expanding ways in which cancer surveillance data are being made available and contributing to cancer control programs the article describes the building of the cancer registry infrastructure and the successful coordination of efforts among the 2 federal agencies that support cancer registry programs the centers for disease control and prevention and the

objective of this study was to review 32 studies on firefighters and to quantitatively and qualitatively determine the cancer risk using a metaanalysis methods a comprehensive search of computerized databases and bibliographies from identified articles was performed three criteria used to assess the probable possible or unlikely risk for 21 cancers included pattern of metarelative risks study type and heterogeneity testing results the findings indicated that firefighters had a probable cancer risk for multiple myeloma with a summary risk estimate sre of 153 and 95 confidence interval ci of 121194 nonhodgkin lymphoma sre  151 95 ci  131173 and prostate sre  128 95 ci  115143 testicular cancer was upgraded to probable because it had the highest summary risk estimate sre  202 95 ci  130313 eight additional cancers were listed as having a possible association with firefighting conclusions our results confirm previous findings of an elevated metarelative risk for multiple myeloma among

to systematically review the literature on the association of firefighting occupation and cancer incidence and mortality overall and for specific cancer sites a systematic review using pubmed embase and web of science was performed up to january 1 2018 we extracted risk estimates of cancers and calculated summary incidence risk estimates sire summary mortality risk estimates smre and their 95 confidence intervals ci publication bias and risk of bias in individual studies were assessed using beggs and eggers tests and the newcastleottawa scale nos respectively we included 50 papers in the review and 48 in the metaanalysis we found significantly elevated sires for cancer of the colon 114 ci 106 to 121 rectum 109 ci 100 to 120 prostate 115 ci 105 to 127 testis 134 ci 108 to 168 bladder 112 ci 104 to 121 thyroid 122 ci 101 to 148 pleura 160 ci 109 to 234 and for malignant melanoma 121 ci 102 to 145 we found significant smres of 136 118 to 157 and 142 105 to 190 for rectal cancer and nonhodgkins lymphoma respectively considering the significantly elevated risk of some cancers in this occupational group we suggest improving preventive measures and securing adequate and relevant

conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis to evaluate the cancer risks among firefighters in the time course and from different geographical areas method a pubmed search was performed to identify cohort studies about cancer risk and firefighting presented with standardized incidence ratios sirs or standardized mortality ratios smrs using randomeffect models metarelative risk estimates msirs msmrs and 95 confidence intervals ci were assessed cohort studies with employment starting before 1950 were classified as old studies starting between 1950 and 1970 as medium and later studies as new results the general cancer risk of firefighters was similar to the general population but msmr decreased over time new studies msmr  081 95 ci 070092 we observed an increase of msir for melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer as well as a decrease of msir for stomach cancer with later employment onset for those cancer sites we did not observe a secular trend of msmrs regional differences between relative cancer risks were particularly observed for bladder cancer conclusions among other things innovative firefighting techniques and better personal protective equipment have provided a safer and healthier working environment for firefighters over time leading to a reduction of overall cancer incidence and mortality ratios increased general preventive medical checkups and possible additional screenings for firefighters might have led to more findings of malignant melanoma of the skin and prostate cancer in the recent past keywords cancer firefighting incidence mortality

containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and flame retardants frs potentially contributing to their increased risk for certain cancers personal protective equipment ppe including firefighter hoods helps to reduce firefighters exposure to toxic substances during fire responses by providing a layer of material on which contaminants deposit prior to reaching the firefighters skin however over time hoods that retain some contamination may actually contribute to firefighters systemic dose we investigated the effectiveness of laundering to reduce or remove contamination on the hoods specifically pahs and three classes of frs polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes nonpbde flame retardants npbfrs and organophosphate flame retardants opfrs participants in the study were grouped into crews of 12 firefighters who worked in pairs by job assignment while responding to controlled fires in a singlefamily residential structure for each pair of firefighters one hood was laundered after every scenario and one was not bulk samples of the routinely laundered and unlaundered hoods from five pairs of firefighters were collected and analyzed residual levels of opfrs npbfrs and pahs were lower in the routinely laundered hoods with total levels of each class of chemicals being 5681 lower on average than the unlaundered hoods pbdes on average were 43 higher in the laundered hoods most likely from cross contamination after this initial testing four of the five unlaundered exposed hoods were subsequently laundered with other heavily exposed unlaundered and unexposed new hoods postlaundering evaluation of these hoods revealed increased levels of pbdes npbfrs and opfrs in both previously exposed and unexposed hoods indicating cross contamination for pahs there was little evidence of cross contamination and the exposed hoods were significantly less contaminated after laundering 76 reduction p  0011 further research is needed to understand how residual contamination on

can assist in assigning io codes from text to enable analysis among the autocoded data occupational results mirrored industry results for both io data for many cases were missing unknown or otherwise insufficient for analysis 4387 of autocoded casesnpcr registries that were included in our paper received additional funding to enhance routine cancer registry practice thus participating registries were incentivized to capture io through abstraction one of the main difficulties facing cancer registries concerning io data is that medical records often have insufficient documentation for io fields especially for elderly patients who have retired furthermore registry staff reported that io coding requires extensive manual review and processing on top of the intense data collection consolidation and cleaning involved for the cdcs regular reporting requirements for registries the participating cancer registries identified the need for ongoing training for registrars so that they can collect better quality text information on io that could more easily be coded by registries or autocoded by the nioccs toolten years prior to the comparative effectiveness research project researchers in massachusetts examined collection of io within their cancer registry this study revealed that detailed medical record review improved either the presence or detail of io information for 32 of the 1 020 cases reviewed9 the researchers also noted the lack of consistency in documentation within the medical record of information related to io furthermore they cited the need for training and time allocation for hospital registrars to continue detailed record reviewsamong the comparative effectiveness research project cancer registries new hampshire had the highest percentage of sufficiently analyzable codes autocoded by the nioccs tool several years before the comparative effectiveness research project the new hampshire state cancer registry provided statewide training to support better capture of io data and found that io data quality could be substantially improved by means of minimal training provided to cancer registrars to highlight the importance of these data15 the increased capture of io data highlighted by the new hampshire study was also seen in the results from this studythe louisiana tumor registry ltr and texas cancer registry tcr collaborated to examine their io data from diagnosis years 2010 and 2011 using the nioccs tool both cancer registries completed manual coding as well as used the nioccs autocoding the findings from their study were similar to our results with 442 of tcr records and 311 of ltr records that were missing or unknown16 this study further highlighted the importance of high quality io text data to help maximize the efficiency of nioccs16additional analyses of the combined io data showed there are some specific factors that can be considered in research studies since standards for a minimum number of sufficient codes do not currently exist we found that limiting our population to ages 1864 years reduced the number of retired text fields decreased the percentage of cases autocoded and among the autocoded data decreased the percentage of insufficient codes by 10 on average data not shown similarly researchers could consider restricting the study to ages 1864 years since more accurate io information may be recorded in their patient file given that this population is more likely to be working however because many solid tumors linked to occupational exposures occur at advanced ages postretirement this would also limit the ability to identify a portion of occupational cancer cases finally nioccs has the flexibility of two confidence levels that can be used for the autocoding process so that researchers can balance capture versus confidence for their analysesdespite the limitations noted above previous analyses of cancer registry io data have shown similar results to those seen in etiologic studies3 furthermore an untried approach to addressing the previously mentioned gaps is the use of job exposure matrices which assign occupational exposure levels based upon io data and might be able to overcome some of the reported limitations of cancer registry io data17 however the usefulness of job exposure matrices are subject to the accuracy of the underlying io data they are being applied tothe use of io data for cancer studies may be limited by the elicitation and recording of data improvement in collection of io data could occur through revision of forms training of healthcare providers to elicit and record this information routinely rather than only when the illness suggests an occupational componentie leading to differential misclassification and training medical personnel to probe more about lifetime occupation when provided retired in response to questions about occupation as shown in the new hampshire study cancer registrars could improve their ability to routinely capture io data through training on standardization of placement of this information within the medical record15 additionally successful incorporation of io as structured data in electronic health records could improve the data available for use in registries improvements in the nioccs tool could help registries to more easily and quickly convert io text into usable code a new coding engine restructured knowledgebase and other underlying databases have been developed for the next release of nioccs expected summer 2017 early test results for cancer registry data show an increase in the number of records autocoded finally individuals from the national cancer institute have developed an algorithm called standardized occupation coding for computerassisted epidemiologic research soccer that maps job titles into standardized occupation classification soc codes which may also be useful in epidemiological studies of occupational exposures18when the information obtained by registries improves there will remain limitations regarding identifying the carcinogenic exposure level of exposure and time latency between exposure and cancer diagnosis increased knowledge about occupations and exposures however is an important public health issue to protect workers and identify potentially harmful exposures3the strengths of this study include the number of cancer cases and registries included which reflect 273 of the us population10 and the identification of specific factors for consideration when analyzing io with cancer cases the limitations of this study are as follows we could not compare nioccs autocoded data with manually coded data due to staffing limitations the comparative effectiveness research project focused on four cancer sites only one year of data was analyzed and data were missing or unknown in many cases analyzing the io data by cancer site could highlight the differences in capture between those with and without known occupational exposure linkages however among the data for this project there was no significant difference between the percentages of autocoded cases even though cml is related to occupational exposure and breast colon and rectum are not data not shown19one future direction of io data collection could include the use of natural language processing in electronic health records which has been successfully used to advance cancer care20 another direction includes linkages of data between cancer registries and occupational registries as has been done to improve race and ethnicity data through linkages with indian health services records21in conclusion while there are known associations between occupational and industrial exposure to cancer the ability to explore such associations is limited by the capture and coding of io data ultimately emphasis on training of providers and registrars as well as future software enhancements will improve the utility of io data and further occupational cancer

with virtually no data on the cancer experience of female firefighters this study examines cancer risk in over 100000 career florida firefighters including 5000  females assessed over a 34year period methods florida firefighter employment records n  109 009 were linked with florida cancer data system registry data 19812014 33 million records identifying 3760 male and 168 femalelinked primary cancers genderspecific age and calendar yearadjusted odds ratios aor and 95 confidence intervals for firefighters vs nonfirefighters were calculated results male firefighters were at increased risk of melanoma aor  156 139176 prostate 136 127146 testicular 166 134206 thyroid 217 178266 and latestage colon cancer 119100141 female firefighters showed significantly elevated risk of brain 254 119542 and thyroid 242 156374 cancers and an elevated risk of melanoma that approached statistical significance 168 097290 among male firefighters there was additional evidence of increased cancer risk younger than the age of 50 vs 50 years and older for thyroid 255 196331 vs 169 122234 prostate 188 149236 vs 136 126147 testicular 160 128201 vs 147 073294 and melanoma 187 155226 vs 142 122166 cancers conclusion male career firefighters in florida are at increased risk for five cancers with typically stronger associations in those diagnosed younger than the age of 50 while there was evidence for increased thyroid and brain cancer and possibly melanoma risk in female firefighters larger cohorts with adequate female representation along with the collection of wellcharacterized exposure histories are needed to more precisely examine cancer risk in this occupational group keywords florida cancer registry cancer risk firefighters occupation  2020 wiley periodicals inc pubmed

leading cause of death among firefighters registry would help identify relationship between exposure to dangerous fumes and toxins and cancer washington us senator amy klobuchar today announced that bipartisan legislation to create a national cancer registry for firefighters diagnosed with the deadly disease has been signed into law the firefighter cancer registry act calls on the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to monitor and study the relationship between careerlong exposure to dangerous fumes and toxins and the incidence of cancer in firefighters cancer has become the leading cause of death for firefighters but we still dont know exactly why we must do more to protect the people who protect us klobuchar said now that the firefighter cancer registry act of 2017 has become law we can collect valuable information to understand the relationship between fighting fires and cancer diagnoses we owe it to our firefighters to study this trend and prevent it from continuing klobuchar introduced the legislation with senator bob menendez dnj lisa murkowski rak and marco rubio rfl along with 45 additional cosponsors firefighters are exposed to a range of harmful toxins and research has indicated that there is a strong connection between firefighting and an increased risk for several major cancers such as testicular stomach multiple myeloma and brain cancers the registry would improve collection capabilities and activities related to the nationwide monitoring of cancer incidence among all firefighters  career and volunteer  and could potentially lead to the development of more sophisticated safety protocols and safeguards for firefighters specifically the registry would store and consolidate epidemiological information submitted by healthcare professionals related to cancer incidence among firefighters and make deidentified data available to public health researchers to provide them with comprehensive datasets to expand groundbreaking research the registrys administrators will be required to consult regularly with epidemiologists public health experts clinicians and firefighters in recent years klobuchar has travelled the state meeting with firefighters and promoting the firefighter cancer registry act she has also been a leader in the fight to protect people from harmful carcinogens in february klobuchar and senator thom tillis rnc introduced thehelping veterans exposed to burn pits act which recently passed the senate the bill would create a center of excellence within the department of veterans affairs to better understand the health effects associated with burn pits such as cancer and treat veterans who become sick after exposure in 2010 klobuchar along with senator mike crapo rid and rep doris matsui dca
