The outbreak was first reported in India on 14 July 2022 when Kerala's State Health Minister Veena George announced a suspected imported case which was confirmed hours later by the NIV. India was the tenth country to report a mpox case in Asia and the first in South Asia. Currently, India has reported 23 cases of mpox.\n\nOn 24 July, the first locally transmitted case was reported in Delhi. The individual, a middle-aged male who had no recent history of travelling abroad, was isolated in the Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi.\n\nBackground\n\nTransmission \n\nA large portion of those infected were believed to have not recently traveled to areas of Africa where mpox is normally found, such as Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as central and western Africa. It is believed to be transmitted by close contact with sick people, with extra caution for those individuals with lesions on their skin or genitals, along with their bedding and clothing. The CDC has also stated that individuals should avoid contact and consumption of dead animals such as rats, squirrels, monkeys and apes along with wild game or lotions derived from animals in Africa.\n\nIn addition to more common symptoms, such as fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and rashes or lesions, some patients have also experienced proctitis, an inflammation of the rectum lining. CDC has also warned clinicians to not rule out mpox in patients with sexually transmitted infections since there have been reports of co-infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes.\n\nHistory\n\nArrival \nOn 14 July, a suspected mpox case was reported in the South-Indian state of Kerala by the State health minister Veena George. The patient was reportedly in close contact with a person who tested positive for mpox abroad in the United Arab Emirates, and arrived in India from UAE four days prior to the announcement.\n\nHours later, minister Veena George announced that the patient was confirmed to be infected with the mpox disease by the NIV of Pune.\n\nSpread \nNo community transmission or locally transmitted cases were detected in India until on 24 July, Delhi reported their first case, and the patient had no history of travel from abroad. He recently attended a party in Himachal Pradesh. Although community transmission of the disease in India wasn’t confirmed by the government health officials.\n\nTimeline\n\nMay 2022\n\nJune 2022\n\nJuly 2022 \n14 July: A suspected mpox case was reported in Kerala. State health minister Veena George said that the patient was in close contact with a person who tested positive for mpox. The patient arrived in India from the United Arab Emirates four days earlier, according to the health minister, and was admitted to a hospital in the state after the patient showed symptoms, and samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV). It was also reported that tests in local hospitals confirmed that the individual was affected with disease, but still samples were sent to the NIV for confirmation, as per the guideline given by the central government.\n\n31 July: A 22-year-old man who had been in the United Arab Emirates came back to India. During his stay in the UAE, he had been in contact with another man who also tested positive for the virus. He then tested positive for mpox in the UAE but left the country following the test, he then arrived in his home-district in Thrissur, Kerala on 22 July. At first, he didn't have much symptoms with others in contact with him saying he was actively playing 'football' and other daily activities. On 26 July, he was admitted to a hospital with a fever and the authorities announced a suspected case. On 31 July, he died in the hospital of an unknown cause. It was then reported he died of mpox.\n\nResponses\n\nCentral government \nAfter the outbreak was highlighted on mid-May, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya directed the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to keep a close watch and monitor the situation. The Union Health Ministry has also directed airport and other port health officers to be vigilant and have been instructed to isolate and send samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune of any sick passenger with a travel history to infected countries.\n\nState and Union territory governments \n Karnataka: Following the directions of the Union Health Ministry, Karnataka state government directed officials to set up mpox surveilience and set up a two-bed isolation ward in every district hospital to isolate suspected or confirmed cases.\n Madhya Pradesh: The state health department issued an advisory about pox-related diseases (especially Smallpox and Mpox) on early June. Health Commissioner-and-Secretary Sudam Khade directed all district Chief Medical and Health Officers (CMHOs) to take necessary steps as per the advisory when needed.\n West Bengal: The West Bengal state government issued an advisory on June. In the advisory, the State Health Department asked hospitals in the state to set up separate facilities to accommodate patients coming from abroad with symptoms and collect and sent samples of suspected patients to the NIV.\n Uttar Pradesh: On June, Uttar Pradesh Chief Medical Officer issued an advisory for and District Magistrates and other higher health officials of the state to remain alert.

while monkeypox is phased outwhen the outbreak of monkeypox expanded earlier this year racist and stigmatizing language online in other settings and in some communities was observed and reported to who in several meetings public and private a number of individuals and countries raised concerns and asked who to propose a way forward to change the nameassigning names to new and very exceptionally

synonym mpox in english for the disease mpox will become a preferred term replacing monkeypox after a transition period of one year this serves to mitigate the concerns raised by experts about confusion caused by a name change in the midst of a global outbreak it also gives time to complete the icd update process and to update who publicationsthe synonym mpox will be included in the icd10 online in the coming days it will be a part of the official 2023 release of icd11 which is the current global standard for health data clinical documentation and statistical aggregation the term monkeypox will remain a searchable term in icd to match historic informationconsiderations for the recommendations included rationale scientific appropriateness extent of current usage pronounceability usability in different languages absence of geographical or zoological references and the ease of retrieval of historical scientific informationusually the icd updating process can take up to several years in this case the process was accelerated though following the standard stepsvarious advisory bodies were heard during the consultation process including experts from the medical and scientific and classification and statistics advisory committees which constituted of representatives from government authorities of 45 different countries the issue of the use of the new name in different languages was extensively discussed the preferred term mpox can be used in other languages if additional naming issues arise these will be addressed via the same mechanism

the virus on to their unborn babyif you have mpoxtell anyone you have been close to recentlystay at home until all scabs fall off and a new layer of skin formscover lesions and wear a wellfitting mask when around other peopleavoid physical contactthe disease mpox formerly monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus commonly abbreviated as mpxv an enveloped doublestranded dna virus of the orthopoxvirus genus in the poxviridae family which includes variola cowpox vaccinia and other viruses the two genetic clades of the virus are clades i and ii the monkeypox virus was discovered in denmark 1958 in monkeys kept for research and the first reported human case of mpox was a ninemonthold boy in the democratic republic of the congo drc 1970 mpox can spread from person to person or occasionally from animals to people following eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the end of smallpox vaccination worldwide mpox steadily emerged in central east and west africa a global outbreak occurred in 20222023 the natural reservoir of the virus is unknown  various small mammals such as squirrels and monkeys are susceptibletransmissionpersontoperson transmission of mpox can occur through direct contact with infectious skin or other lesions such as in the mouth or on genitals this includes contact which is facetoface talking or breathingskintoskin touching or vaginalanal sexmouthtomouth kissingmouthtoskin contact oral sex or kissing the skinrespiratory droplets or shortrange aerosols from prolonged close contact the virus then enters the body through broken skin mucosal surfaces e g oral pharyngeal ocular genital anorectal or via the respiratory tract mpox can spread to other members of the household and to sex partners people with multiple sexual partners are at higher riskanimal to human transmission of mpox occurs from infected animals to humans from bites or scratches or during activities such as hunting skinning trapping cooking playing with carcasses or eating animals the extent of viral circulation in animal populations is not entirely known and further studies are underway people can contract mpox from contaminated objects such as clothing or linens through sharps injuries in health care or in community setting such as tattoo parlourssigns and symptoms mpox causes signs and symptoms which usually begin within a week but can start 121 days after exposure symptoms typically last 24 weeks but may last longer in someone with a weakened immune system common symptoms of mpox arerashfeversore throatheadachemuscle achesback painlow energyswollen lymph nodesfor some people the first symptom of mpox is a rash while others may have different symptoms firstthe rash begins as a flat sore which develops into a blister filled with liquid and may be itchy or painful as the rash heals the lesions dry up crust over and fall offsome people may have one or a few skin lesions and others have hundreds or more these can appear anywhere on the body such as thepalms of hands and soles of feetface mouth and throatgroin and genital areasanussome people also have painful swelling of their rectum or pain and difficulty when peeingpeople with mpox are infectious and can pass the disease on to others until all sores have healed and a new layer of skin has formedchildren pregnant people and people with weak immune systems are at risk for complications from mpoxtypically for mpox fever muscle aches and sore throat appear first the mpox rash begins on the face and spreads over the body extending to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and evolves over 24 weeks in stages  macules papules vesicles pustules lesions dip in the centre before crusting over scabs then fall off lymphadenopathy swollen lymph nodes is a classic feature of mpox some people can be infected without developing any symptomsin the context of the global outbreak of mpox which began in 2022 caused mostly by clade iib virus the illness begins differently in some people in just over a half of cases a rash may appear before or at the same time as other symptoms and does not always progress over the body the first lesion can be in the groin anus or in or around the mouth people with mpox can become very sick for example the skin can become infected with bacteria leading to abscesses or serious skin damage other complications include pneumonia corneal infection with loss of vision pain or difficulty swallowing vomiting and diarrhoea causing severe dehydration or malnutrition sepsis infection of the blood with a widespread inflammatory response in the body inflammation of the brain encephalitis heart myocarditis rectum proctitis genital organs balanitis or urinary passages urethritis or death persons with immune suppression due to medication or medical conditions are at higher risk of serious illness and death due to mpox people living with hiv that is not wellcontrolled or treated more often develop severe disease diagnosisidentifying mpox can be difficult as other infections and conditions can look similar it is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox measles bacterial skin infections scabies herpes syphilis other sexually transmissible infections and medicationassociated allergies someone with mpox may also have another sexually transmissible infection such as herpes alternatively a child with suspected mpox may also have chickenpox for these reasons testing is key for people to get treatment as early as possible and prevent further spread detection of viral dna by polymerase chain reaction pcr is the preferred laboratory test for mpox the best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash  skin fluid or crusts  collected by vigorous swabbing in the absence of skin lesions testing can be done on oropharyngeal anal or rectal swabs testing blood is not recommended antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxvirusesmore information on laboratory confirmation of mpox can be found heretreatment and vaccinationthe goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash manage pain and prevent complications early and supportive care is important to help manage symptoms and avoid further problemsgetting an mpox vaccine can help prevent infection the vaccine should be given within 4 days of contact with someone who has mpox or within up to 14 days if there are no symptomsit is recommended for people at high risk to get vaccinated to prevent infection with mpox especially during an outbreak this includeshealth workers at risk of exposuremen who have sex with menpeople with multiple sex partnerssex workerspersons who have mpox should be cared for away from other peopleseveral antivirals such as tecovirimat originally developed to treat smallpox have been used to treat mpox and further studies are underway further information is available on mpox vaccination and case managementselfcare and preventionmost people with mpox will recover within 24 weeks things to do to help the symptoms and prevent infecting othersdostay home and in your own room if possiblewash hands often with soap and water or hand sanitizer especially before or after touching soreswear a mask and cover lesions when around other people until your rash healskeep skin dry and uncovered unless in a room with someone elseavoid touching items in shared spaces and disinfect shared spaces frequentlyuse saltwater rinses for sores in the mouthtake sitz baths or warm baths with baking soda or epsom salts for body sorestake overthecounter medications for pain like paracetamol acetaminophen or ibuprofendo notpop blisters or scratch sores which can slow healing spread the rash to other parts of the body and cause sores to become infected orshave areas with sores until scabs have healed and you have new skin underneath this can spread the rash to other parts of the bodyto prevent spread of mpox to others persons with mpox should isolate at home or in hospital if needed for the duration of the infectious period from onset of symptoms until lesions have healed and scabs fall off covering lesions and wearing a medical mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skintoskin or mouthtoskin

member states portal mpox monkeypox 11 december 2023  qa mpox or monkeypox is an illness caused by the monkeypox virus it is a viral infection which can spread between people and occasionally from the environment to people via things and surfaces that have been touched by a person with mpox in settings where the monkeypox virus is present among some wild animals it can also be transmitted from infected animals to people who have contact with them following a series of consultations with global experts who has begun using a new preferred term mpox as a synonym for monkeypox read more on the background to this decision here people who have close contact including sexual contact with someone who has mpox are at risk close contact can mean being facetoface such as talking skintoskin such as touching or vaginalanal sex mouthtomouth such as kissing or mouthtoskin contact such as oral sex people who have contact with clothing bedding towels objects electronics and other surfaces that have been touched by someone with mpox are also at risk anyone living with someone who has mpox should take steps to reduce the risk of becoming infected a person who has been diagnosed with mpox should be assessed by a health care provider to determine if they are well enough to be cared for at home and if isolation can be safely managed at home health workers should follow infection prevention and control measures to protect themselves while caring for patients with mpox by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment and adhering to protocol for safely swabbing lesions for diagnostic testing and handling sharps such as needles to protect yourself and others against mpox know the signs and symptoms how the virus spreads what to do if you get ill and what the risk is in your area or community if the monkeypox virus is spreading in your area or in your community have open conversations with those you come into close contact with about any symptoms you or they may have avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox especially sexual contact clean your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcoholbased hand rub if you think you might have mpox you can act to protect others by seeking medical advice and isolating from others until you have been evaluated and tested if you have mpox you should isolate from others until all your lesions have crusted over the scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed underneath this will stop you from passing on the virus to others follow your local health authority instructions on isolation at home or in a health facility use condoms as a precaution whilst having sexual contact for 12 weeks after you have recoveredin countries where animals carry the monkeypox virus protect yourself by avoiding unprotected contact with wild animals especially those that are sick or dead including their meat and blood any foods containing animal parts or meat should be cooked thoroughly before eating if you have mpox your healthcare provider will advise you on what to do while you recover follow national advice on whether you should recover at home or if you need care in a health facility in the meantime it is important to avoid having close contact with others including sexual contactif you are advised to isolate at home protect those you live with as much as possible by asking friends and family to help you by delivering things you needisolating in a separate room using a separate bathroom or cleaning any surfaces you touched after each use cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces with soap and water and a household disinfectantavoiding sweepingvacuuming this might disturb virus particles and cause others to become infected using separate utensils objects electronics or clean well with soap and waterdisinfectant before sharing not sharing towels bedding or clothes doing your own laundry lift bedding clothes and towels carefully without shaking them put materials in a plastic bag before carrying it to the washing machine and wash them with hot water over 60 degrees celsiusopening windows for good ventilation andencouraging everyone in the house to clean their hands regularly with soap and water or an alcoholbased hand sanitizerif you cannot avoid being in the same room as someone else or having close contact with another person while isolating at home then do your best to limit their risk by avoiding touching each othercleaning your hands often with soap and water or an alcoholbased hand sanitizercovering your rash with clothing or bandages until you can isolate again  your rash will heal best if uncoveredopening windows throughout the homeensuring you and anyone in the room with you wear wellfitting medical masks andmaintaining at least 1 metre of distance from othersif you cannot do your own laundry and someone else needs to do it for you they should wear a wellfitting medical mask disposable gloves and take the laundry precautions listed above evidence suggests that immunosuppressed people are at higher risk of developing severe mpox or dying symptoms of severe mpox include larger more widespread lesions especially in the mouth eyes and genitals secondary bacterial infections of the skin or blood and lung infections the data show worst symptoms in people who are severely immunosuppressedpeople with advanced hiv disease late presentation low cd4 count and high hiv viral load have an elevated risk of death if they develop severe mpox people living with hiv who achieve viral suppression through antiretroviral treatment do not appear to be at any higher risk of severe mpox than the general population effective hiv treatment reduces the risk of developing severe mpox symptoms in the case of infection people with untreated hiv and advanced hiv disease may be immunocompromised and therefore be at greater risk of severe mpox who advises countries to integrate hiv and mpox prevention and care people who are sexually active and who do not know their hiv status are advised to test for hiv if it is available to them people living with hiv on effective treatment have the same life expectancy as their hiv negative peers severe mpox cases seen in some countries highlight the urgent need to increase equitable access to mpox vaccines and therapeutics and to hiv prevention testing and treatment without this most affected groups are being left without the tools they need to protect their sexual health and wellbeingif you are living with hiv continue to take your hiv medication as directed if you think you may have mpox seek medical adviceif you think you are at risk for mpox or have been diagnosed with mpox you may benefit from testing for sexually transmitted infections stis if you dont know your hiv status ask your health worker for an hiv test this will help your health care provider to ensure you receive the best possible care children can catch mpox if they have close contact with someone who has symptoms children can be exposed to the virus at home from parents caregivers or other family members through close contact adolescents who have engaged in sexual activity with someone with mpox can also be exposed the mpox rash can at first resemble other common childhood illnesses such as chickenpox and other viral infections if a child you are caring for has symptoms that could be mpox seek advice from a healthcare provider they will help to get them tested and to access the care they need children may be at greater risk of severe mpox than adults they should be closely monitored until they have recovered in case they need additional care a health worker responsible for the child may advise that they are cared for in a health facility in this situation a parent or caregiver who is healthy and at low risk of mpox will be allowed to stay with them if you have confirmed or suspected mpox and you are breastfeeding talk to your healthcare provider for advice they will assess the risk of transmitting mpox as well as the risk of withholding breastfeeding to your infant if it is possible for you to continue to breastfeed and have close contact they will advise you on how to reduce the risk by taking other measures including covering up lesions the risk of infection will need to be carefully balanced with the potential harm and distress caused by interrupting breastfeeding and close contact between parent and child it is not yet known whether the monkeypox virus can be spread from parent to child through breastmilk this is an area in need of further study contracting mpox during pregnancy can be dangerous for the fetus or newborn infant and can lead to loss of the pregnancy stillbirth or complications for the parent if you are pregnant avoid close contact with anyone who has mpox anyone who has close contact with someone who is infectious can get mpox regardless of who they are if you think you have been exposed to or are showing symptoms that could be mpox contact your healthcare provider they will help you get tested and access the care you need our understanding of how long immunity lasts following monkeypox infection is currently limited we do not yet have a clear understanding whether a previous monkeypox infection gives you immunity against future infections and if so for how long there have been some cases of second infections reported even if you have had mpox in the past you should be doing everything you can to avoid getting reinfected if you have had mpox in the past and someone in your household has it now you can protect others by being the designated caregiver as you are more likely to have some immunity than others are however you should still take all precautions to avoid becoming infected who team

west african clade was laboratory confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr on a vesicular swab on 6 may by the united kingdom health security agency ukhsa rare and imported pathogens laboratoryepidemiology of the diseasemonkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of central and west africa it is caused by the monkeypox virus which belongs to the orthopoxvirus family monkeypox can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets the incubation period of monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days the disease is often selflimiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14 to 21 days symptoms can be mild or severe and lesions can be very itchy or painful the animal reservoir remains unknown although is likely to be among rodents contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are known risk factorsthere are two clades of monkeypox virus the west african clade and congo basin central african clade although the west african clade of monkeypox virus infection sometimes leads to severe illness in some individuals disease is usually selflimiting the case fatality ratio for the west african clade has been documented to be around 1 whereas for the congo basin clade it may be as high as 10 children are also at higher risk and monkeypox during pregnancy may lead to complications congenital monkeypox or stillbirthmilder cases of monkeypox may go undetected and represent a risk of persontoperson transmission there is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those travelling and exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to parts of west and central africa while a vaccine has been approved for prevention of monkeypox and traditional smallpox vaccine also provides protection these vaccines are not widely available and populations worldwide
