Both Wild Card Series began on October 7, with Game 2s scheduled for October 8. ESPN broadcast both Wild Card Series in the United States together with ESPN Radio. For the first time, Canadian rightsholder Sportsnet – a sibling property to the Toronto Blue Jays under Rogers Communications – was allowed to produce its own broadcast of a Blue Jays postseason series; previously, it was required to simulcast a U.S. or MLB International broadcast. These matchups were:\n\n (3) Cleveland Guardians (AL Central champions) vs. (6) Tampa Bay Rays (third wild card): Guardians win series 2–0.\n (4) Toronto Blue Jays (first wild card) vs. (5) Seattle Mariners (second wild card): Mariners win series 2–0.\n\nBackground\nOn March 10, Major League Baseball changed the postseason structure for the first time since 2012, adding a sixth team to the postseason in each league, awarding the two best division winners in each league (seeded by record) a bye into the Division Series, and added a best-of-three Wild Card round hosted by the higher seed. The lowest-seeded division winner, and three wild card teams (each seeded according to regular season record), will play in this round. The third seed will play the sixth seed, and the fourth seed will play the fifth seed. The postseason structure is similar to the temporary format MLB used in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic without first-round byes for the top two seeds.\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians (92–70) clinched the American League Central, their first postseason appearance since 2020, and their first under the Guardians moniker. However, they were locked into the third seed as the American League division winner with the worst record and hosted the Tampa Bay Rays (86–76), who clinched a postseason berth, their fourth straight postseason appearance and eighth overall in franchise history, with all eight coming since 2008, on September 30. In six regular-season meetings in 2022, the Guardians bested the Rays 4–2, including two out of three less than a week ago in Cleveland.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays (92–70) clinched a postseason berth on September 29 for their first appearance since 2020 after missing out on the postseason by one game last year and secured home-field advantage in the wild card round as the best wild card team (non-division winner) in terms of record on October 3, accomplishing back-to-back 90-win seasons for the first time since 1992 and 1993, which were the two seasons they repeated as champions. They hosted the 1977-expansion cousins Seattle Mariners (90–72), who clinched their first postseason berth since 2001, ending the longest postseason drought in North American professional sports on September 30. The Mariners won the regular-season series 5–2 over the Blue Jays in 2022, including a four-game sweep in July in Seattle. Despite handling Toronto for those seven games, the Mariners only outscored the Blue Jays 26–21 on the season.\n\nAs the top two seeds, the Houston Astros (106–56) and New York Yankees (99–63) earned a bye and home-field advantage in the ALDS.\n\nMatchups\n\nCleveland Guardians vs. Tampa Bay Rays\n\nToronto Blue Jays vs. Seattle Mariners\n\nCleveland vs. Tampa Bay\nThis was the second postseason match-up between Cleveland and Tampa Bay. The two teams previously met in the 2013 American League Wild Card Game when Tampa Bay defeated Cleveland 4–0.\n\nGame 1\n\nGame 1 featured a pitching duel between Cy Young candidates Shane Bieber and Shane McClanahan. The game was scoreless until a José Siri solo home run in the top of the sixth inning, which would immediately be topped by a José Ramírez two-run home run in the bottom of the sixth. Bieber went , only throwing 99 pitches on the day while not allowing a hit until the fifth inning. Two runs would be all the Guardians needed as Emmanuel Clase closed the game with a perfect ninth, giving the All-Star closer his first career postseason save.\n\nAt a brisk two hours and 17 minutes, it was the shortest postseason game since Game 2 of the 1999 NLDS between the Braves and Astros.\n\nGame 2\n\nIn the contest, the Rays and Guardians used eight pitchers each and totaled 39 strikeouts. The Guardians came close to scoring in the bottom of the sixth, where they had the bases loaded with no outs, but José Ramírez struck out and Josh Naylor grounded into a double play to end the inning scoreless. The Rays had runners on the corners on the top of the 12th, but Ramírez turned a ground ball by Manuel Margot into a difficult out at first base to end the inning. In the bottom of the 13th, with both teams having increasingly depleted bullpens, ace Corey Kluber made his first relief appearance in more than nine years, that would eventually end up surrendering the walk-off home run to Oscar González. Sam Hentges, on the other hand, lasted the longest among all relievers, pitching the last three full innings for Cleveland while not allowing a single hit, striking out six batters and earning the win. It was Cleveland's first postseason series win since the 2016 American League Championship Series.\n\nWith 14 innings scoreless for both teams, this was the longest scoreless postseason game in Major League history, until the Astros and Mariners surpassed it a week later in Game 3 of the 2022 American League Division Series. For Tampa Bay, the walk-off series-ending loss was their seventh straight loss (regular season and postseason).\n\nComposite line score\n2022 ALWC (2–0): Cleveland Guardians beat Tampa Bay Rays\n\nToronto vs. Seattle\nThis was the first postseason match-up between Toronto and Seattle.\n\nGame 1\n\nBlue Jays starter Alek Manoah began the game by hitting the Mariners' star rookie outfielder Julio Rodríguez. Two batters later, Eugenio Suárez flipped a line drive down the right field line for an RBI double, scoring Rodríguez. Cal Raleigh then worked Manoah a full count before hitting a home run over the right field fence to give the Mariners a 3–0 lead in the top of the first. In the Seattle fifth, Suarez drove in another run when his fielder's choice plated Rodriguez. Four runs would be all that Mariners ace Luis Castillo needed, as the big trade deadline acquisition twirled a shutout over  innings, striking out five and allowing just six hits. Castillo was the first ever Mariners pitcher to throw at least seven scoreless innings in a postseason game.\n\nAndres Munoz relieved Castillo in the eighth and finished off the game for Seattle with a five-out performance, giving the team its first postseason victory since Game 3 of the 2001 American League Championship Series. For the Blue Jays, George Springer and Matt Chapman each had two hits, while Toronto relievers combined for  scoreless innings after Manoah exited the game.\n\nGame 2\n\nIn Game 2, Seattle came back from a seven-run deficit to clinch the series, in what would become tied for the second largest comeback in MLB postseason history, and the largest comeback in MLB postseason history on the road.\n\nThe Mariners' Robbie Ray, a Cy Young Award winner for the Blue Jays the preceding year, faced off against Toronto's Kevin Gausman, who was brought in during the off-season to essentially replace Ray. The Blue Jays got off to a fast start, scoring four runs on a two-run home run by Teoscar Hernández in the bottom of the second, a run batted in by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the third, and another home run by Hernández in the fourth which chased Ray. The Mariners got their first hit in the fifth inning, when a sacrifice fly by Jarred Kelenic got them on the board. With the score now 4–1, the Blue Jays increased their lead by scoring four more runs off Seattle reliever Paul Sewald. However, in the top of the sixth, Gausman loaded the bases on three consecutive singles. After a strikeout and a pop out, he was relieved by Tim Mayza, who allowed Seattle to cut the lead down to 8–5 on a wild pitch and a three-run home run from Carlos Santana. The Blue Jays extended their lead by a run in the seventh on a Danny Jansen single scoring Matt Chapman.\n\nSeattle responded in the top of the eighth inning, cutting the score to 9–6 after four straight batters reached base. With the bases loaded again, Toronto's closer Jordan Romano (who was brought in to relieve Anthony Bass with runners on first and second with no outs) struck out Santana and Dylan Moore before George Springer and Bo Bichette collided on a bloop bases-clearing double by J. P. Crawford to improbably tie the game at nine. Springer got the worse of the collision and had to be carted off the field. After reliever Andrés Muñoz allowed no runs in the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners took the lead in the top of the ninth on a Adam Frazier double scoring Cal Raleigh, who also doubled earlier in the inning. In the bottom of the ninth, rookie starter George Kirby worked around a one-out walk to Chapman to earn the first save of his career and send the Mariners to the American League Division Series.\n\nComposite line score\n2022 ALWC (2–0): Seattle Mariners beat Toronto Blue Jays\n\nSee also\n2022 National League Wild Card Series\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMajor League Baseball postseason schedule\n\nWild Card Series\nCleveland Guardians postseason\nSeattle Mariners postseason\nTampa Bay Rays postseason\nToronto Blue Jays postseason\nMajor League Baseball Wild Card Series\nAmerican League Wild Card Series\nAmerican League Wild Card Series\nAmerican League Wild Card Series\nAmerican League Wild Card Series\nAmerican League Wild Card Series\nBaseball competitions in Cleveland\nBaseball competitions in Toronto", "unikey": "2022 American League Wild Card Series", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Matchups", "Cleveland_vs._Tampa_Bay", "Toronto_vs._Seattle", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["On March 10,Major League Baseballchanged the postseason structure for the first time since2012, adding a sixth team to the postseason in each league, awarding the two best division winners in each league (seeded by record) a bye into theDivision Series, and added a best-of-threeWild Card roundhosted by the higher seed.

for all the rain that this lush region of the country accumulates more than any major us city theres been a widespread drought here as equally insatiable as it is intangible the mariners who on their best days can be the most coveted and beloved show in town have longed to return to that elite stage but the drought has weighed down those ambitions especially as it lingered for two decades manager scott servais says he thinks about the drought every day but acknowledges that it comes with the territory a byproduct of 20 long years seeping into the fabric of an organization to the point where it becomes ingrained in its identity and now the drought is over a reign is underway in seattle and finally the longest active playoff void in north american professional sports has ended the mariners at

tonight was just a taste said logan gilbert who logged eight solid innings on friday to put the mariners in the position for raleighs heroics those fans they love baseball theyve supported us the whole year we want to be back here next weekend get the latest from mlbsign up to receive our daily morning lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around major league baseball sign upbut theyre thinking even grander than that i do believe this team can go very deep in the playoffs and win a world series servais said weve got that kind of pitching and defense and weve got the it factor  and that goes a long way this time of year throughout the three years of transition that led into the 2022 season veterans mitch haniger and marco gonzales the lone holdovers from the previous regime have been vocal in the intent of not just getting into the dance but winning the whole thing with a roster packed with elite starting pitching a bullpen that despite a few hiccups of late has been one of mlbs best and a lineup that doesnt have the star power of other juggernauts but instead wears opposing pitchers out seattle possesses the ingredients that are typically conducive for teams that win  and advance  in playoff series yet even with their talent it hasnt been the most seamless or straightforward season the mariners scuffled as spring stretched into summer weighed heavily by their brutal early travel and it all came to a head when the club dropped to a seasonhigh 10 games under 500 on june 19 and their playoff odds dropped to 53 per fangraphs things looked as bleak as could be before they emphatically turned things around fueled heavily by a 14game winning streak leading into the allstar break tied with the defending champion braves for the longest this season but even before the turnaround most players  gonzales especially  never had doubt if youre not crying youre not human seattle mariners mariners october 1 2022 its the character in the clubhouse ive said it all year gonzales said i said it in spring training i said it in april may and june there were some people that were talking some outside noise we closed that off we just believed in ourselves we knew we had a talented team we just needed to hit our stride find our identity and we found it were here pitching has been the clubs primary formula with a rotation that has remarkably avoided an il stint all season and a bullpen packed with velocity but theyve also been carried by star rookie julio rodríguez who is on the 10day injured list with a lower back strain but began baseball activity on thursday and is expected back monday rodríguez who played his way onto the big league roster with an eyeopening spring training has been a symbolic embodiment of the mariners transition from mediocrity with superstar potential that could make this playoff berth one of many to come the goal here is to be that team thats in this position every year servais said so we dont have to talk about it like its a big deal and were just used to it but weve got work to do after taking their postseason hopes to the final day of last years regular season but ultimately coming up short the mariners transitioned from surprise darlings to a team with heightened expectations for the first time since at least 2018 this ones for you seattle you stuck with us through thick and thin we couldnt be happier to celebrate this with the best fans in the world  pictwittercomdir4cje7nh seattle mariners mariners october 1 2022 the club increased spending bringing in reigning al cy young award winner robbie ray graduated top prospects rodríguez george kirby and matt brash from its thenno 2ranked farm system made a massive splash at the trade deadline in acquiring twotime allstar luis castillo and firmly went allin on ending this drought i have heard it for seven years servais said every day when i get up in the morning and i drive to work thats whats on my mind but the goal is winning a world series its not just to end the drought the labors of a rebuild that began nearly four full years ago have finally paid off with an aging and expensive roster entering the 201819
