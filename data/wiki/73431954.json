It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's NXT brand division. The event took place on May 28, 2023, at the Tsongas Center in Lowell, Massachusetts. It was the first Battleground held since July 2017, as well as the first to livestream on Peacock. \n\nSix matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Carmelo Hayes defeated Bron Breakker to retain the NXT Championship. In other prominent matches, Tiffany Stratton defeated Lyra Valkyria in a tournament final to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship, Noam Dar defeated Dragon Lee to retain the NXT Heritage Cup, Gallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang) defeated The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed) to retain the NXT Tag Team Championship, and in the opening bout, Wes Lee defeated Tyler Bate and Joe Gacy in a triple threat match to retain the NXT North American Championship.\n\nBattleground was held on the same day as Double or Nothing, a pay-per-view event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and specifically AEW's flagship event. This marked the first time since April 1989 that two major promotions produced major events head-to-head, after WWE's WrestleMania V and World Championship Wrestling's Clash of the Champions VI. \nThe event received highly positive reviews from critics, with the Last Man Standing match being singled out for praise for its brutality, story, and the performances of Dragunov and Dijak, and has been labeled a match of the year contender for WWE. The North American Championship triple threat and the NXT Women's Championship match also received praise.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\n\nBattleground was an annual July pay-per-view (PPV) event established by WWE in 2013, although the original event was held in October. Battleground continued until its final event in July 2017, which was held exclusively for wrestlers from the promotion's SmackDown brand division, following the reintroduction of the brand extension in July 2016 where WWE split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. A Raw-exclusive Battleground was expected to be held in 2018, but it was taken off of WWE's PPV lineup as following WrestleMania 34 that year, WWE discontinued brand-exclusive PPVs, resulting in the promotion reducing the yearly amount of PPVs produced. However, on March 30, 2023, WWE revived the event for its developmental territory, NXT, and it was scheduled to take place on May 28, 2023, at the Tsongas Center in Lowell, Massachusetts. The event was livestreamed on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in most international markets, in turn marking the first Battleground to air on Peacock due to the American version of the WWE Network merging under Peacock in March 2021â€”unlike previous Battlegrounds, the 2023 event did not air on PPV as beginning with the 2022 calendar year, NXT's major events are only available via WWE's livestreaming platforms. Tickets went on sale on April 1. \n\nThe event went head-to-head with Double or Nothing, a PPV event produced by All Elite Wrestling (AEW), which is AEW's flagship event. This marked the first time since 1989 that two major promotions produced major events head-to-head, after WWE's WrestleMania V (airing on PPV) and World Championship Wrestling's Clash of the Champions VI (airing on TBS). According to WWE executive Shawn Michaels, the scheduling was not intended for WWE to go head-to-head with AEW, but that it was just due to the holiday (Memorial Day weekend) as he said WWE events had always done well on holidays.\n\nStorylines\nThe card included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television program, NXT, and the supplementary online streaming show, Level Up.\n\nAt Stand & Deliver, Carmelo Hayes defeated Bron Breakker to win the NXT Championship, ending Breakker's reign at 362 days. On the following episode of NXT, Breakker embraced Hayes and Trick Williams, but turned on them. At Spring Breakin' after Hayes' successful title defense, Hayes challenged Breakker to a title match at Battleground, only for Breakker to lay out Hayes and Williams. The following week, Breakker accepted the challenge.\n\nDuring the 2023 WWE Draft, NXT Women's Champion Indi Hartwell was drafted to the main roster on Raw. She had also recently injured her leg. On the May 2 episode of NXT, Hartwell announced that she would be vacating the title and that a tournament to crown a new champion would begin the following week with the final at Battleground. The tournament participants were revealed on May 8.\n\nIn April 2023, after months of inactivity following the closure of NXT UK, reigning NXT Heritage Cup Champion Noam Dar made his debut for NXT. On the May 16 episode of NXT, Dar hosted his first United States installment of \"Supernova Sessions\" and had Dragon Lee as his guest. Dar bragged about his Heritage Cup and lorded it over Lee, much to Lee's annoyance. Lee urged Dar to defend his championship but Dar resisted until Nathan Frazer interrupted and addressed Dar's constant dodging of title defenses. Provoked by this, Dar accepted Lee's challenge for the Heritage Cup at Battleground, marking the first defense of the Heritage Cup on the NXT brand and subsequently its first defense in the United States.\n\nOn the May 2 episode of NXT, Wes Lee successfully retained the NXT North American Championship after interference from Tyler Bate. The following week, Bate (accompanied by Lee) won his match after interference from Joe Gacy. On the May 16 episode Bate and Lee were attacked backstage by Gacy and the other members of The Schism. Lee went to the ring to call out Gacy for the attack to which Gacy responded that Lee shouldn't trust Bate. Despite suffering an arm injury during the attack Bate came out to address Gacy's claims but in the process also admitted he was eyeing Lee's championship. Lee then said he would be willing to defend the title against both men at Battleground.\n\nSince April, Dijak and Ilja Dragunov had been feuding with each other. At Spring Breakin', Dijak viciously attacked Dragunov backstage. On May 17, after more weeks of feuding, a Last Man Standing match between the two was scheduled for Battleground.\n\nAt Stand & Deliver, Gallus (Mark Coffey and Wolfgang) (with Joe Coffey) retained the NXT Tag Team Championship in a triple threat tag team match involving The Creed Brothers (Julius Creed and Brutus Creed). The Creed Brothers got a championship rematch on the April 18 episode of NXT where Gallus retained. On the May 16 episode, after The Creed Brothers won their match, they called out Gallus to another title match at Battleground, which was confirmed the following week.\n\nEvent\n\nPreliminary matches\nThe event began with Wes Lee defending the NXT North American Championship against Tyler Bate and Joe Gacy (accompanied by Ava) in a triple threat match. In the opening stages, Bate delivered a suplex and a standing shooting star press to Lee, but Gacy broke up the pin. Lee then delivered two Cardiac Kicks simultaneously to both Gacy and Bate for a two count. Bate then delivered the Tyler Driver '97, but Lee broke it up. Lee then delivered a Meteora, but Gacy broke it up. As Gacy was sitting on the top turnbuckle, Lee delivered a tope suicida to Bate on the outside. As Gacy attempted the Upside Down, Lee dodged it and hit the Cardiac Kick to retain the title.\n\nThe next bout was a British Rounds Rules match for the NXT Heritage Cup, contested between defending champion Noam Dar and Dragon Lee (with Nathan Frazer). In the first 5 minutes of the first round, Dar kicked Lee off the apron and started messing with Lee's mask. As the first round came to an end, Oro Mensah came out to be Dar's cornerman. In the second round, Lee delivered a headscissors takedown and a diving springboard dropkick for a two count. Dar then rolled up Lee to score the first fall (Noam 1: Lee 0). In the third round, Lee delivered a suicide dive to Dar and a diving knee strike for another two count. Dar then delivered a back elbow to Lee as the third round ended. In the penultimate round, Dar attempted a Kneebar, but Lee escaped. Lee then delivered a Pele kick and a Texas Cloverleaf, but Mensah helped Dar to reach the ropes. Mensah then pushed Frazer into the steel steps. Lee then delivered a headscissors driver to score his first fall (Noam 1: Lee 1). In the final round, Lee delivered a knee strike, a german suplex, and a sit-out powerbomb for a two count. As Lee signaled his finishing move, Jakara Jackson came down to the ring and distracted the referee, allowing Lash Legend to hit Lee with a bucket. Dar then delivered the Nova Roller to win the match and retain the title (Noam 2: Lee 1).\n\nThe next match was a Last Man Standing match contested between Ilja Dragunov and Dijak. In the closing stages, Dragunov hit the steel steps on Dijak, then put the steps on Dijak and delivered a Coast-to-Coast, but Dijak was able to get to his feet. Dijak then started choking Dragunov with a steel chair. Dragunov then delivered the Torpedo Moscow and an elbow strike to Dijak's head. Dijak was not able to get to his feet before the referee's count of 10, thus Dragunov won the match.\n\nNext, Gallus (Wolfgang and Mark Coffey, with Joe Coffey) defended the NXT Tag Team Championship against The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed, with Ivy Nile). In the closing stages, Brutus delivered the Brutus Ball to both Wolfgang and Mark. Julius then delivered belly-to-back suplexes and a shooting star press to both Mark and Wolfgang for a two count. As Joe was distracting the referee, Nile pushed him, allowing Julius to deliver a clothesline to Joe on the outside. Ava then came out and pushed Nile into the ring post. Gallus then delivered the Gallus Gate to Julius to retain the titles.\n\nIn the penultimate match, Lyra Valkyria faced Tiffany Stratton in a tournament final for the vacant NXT Women's Championship. In the opening stages, Valkyria delivered a missile dropkick, two Northern Lights suplexes, an enzeguiri, and a crucifix powerbomb for a two count. Valkyria then delivered a release German suplex. As Valkyria attempted a spinning leg lariat, her knee tweaked, allowing Stratton to deliver a powerslam. As Stratton attempted a Moonsault, Valkyria moved out of the way and delivered the spinning leg lariat, but Stratton's feet reached the ropes. As Valkyria attempted a top rope powerbomb, Stratton countered it into a hurricana and then delivered a Death Valley Driver and the Prettiest Moonsault Ever to become the new NXT Women's Champion.\n\nMain event\nIn the main event, Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) defended the NXT Championship against Bron Breakker. In the opening stages, Breakker delivered a spinebuster and a belly-to-back suplex. Hayes then delivered the Fadeaway leg drop. Breakker then delivered a top rope frankensteiner for a two count. As Breakker attempted a military press powerslam, Hayes countered into a DDT. Hayes then delivered a pump kick and a springboard forearm, but Breakker prevented the referee from counting. As Breakker attempted the Steiner Recliner, Hayes escaped and hit a pump kick. As Hayes attempted a springboard clothesline, Breakker countered into a mid-air spear for a two count. Hayes then delivered a series of superkicks, a tornado DDT, and the Nothing But Net to retain the title.\n\nReception\nDave Meltzer rated the last man standing match 4.75 stars, which was the highest rated of the night. The lowest rated matches would be the NXT Heritage Cup and the NXT Tag Team Championship matches both receiving 3.25 stars each. The opening triple threat received 3.5 stars, the same as Tiffany vs Lyra. Finally the main event received 4 stars.\n\nResults\n\nNXT Women's Championship Tournament\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2023 WWE Network events\nProfessional wrestling in Massachusetts\nEvents in Lowell, Massachusetts\nEvents in Massachusetts\nMay 2023 events in the United States", "unikey": "NXT Battleground (2023)", "summary": "The 2023 NXT Battleground was the sixth Battleground professional wrestling livestreaming event produced by WWE.

spring breakin orlando florida at the wwe performance center aired live april 25 2023 on usa network the show started off with wwe developmental wrestlers hanging out at a spring picniccookout hank walker was disappointed that tank ledger couldnt make it ivy nile defeated a male developmental wrestler in an arm wrestling contest the various developmental wrestlers previewed the upcoming card big body javi was acting cocky while getting a burger and was chased off by dabbakato nathan frazer was teaching wendy choo and valentina feroz on how to play cornhole and how to use cornhole as a motivational exercise dabba kato ended the segment by tossign big body javi into a water fountain vic joseph and booker t were on commentary alicia taylor was the ring announcer vic joseph gave a special introduction for the car being used in the trunk match which he claimed was donated by stacks parents 1 pretty deadly kit wilson and elton prince vs tony dangelo and channing stacks lorenzo in a trunk matchthere were various weapons at ringside along with a random kiddie pool filled with balls for a ball pit pretty deadly ended up getting the upper hand during the initial brawl booker compared this match to a texas tornado match wrestled by the von erichs tony d and stacks got the upper hand with hockey fight strikes tony d dumped wilson to ringside prince took a uppercut from stacks tony d gave stacks a hip toss to send him on prince both teams brawled to a concourse area tony d and stacks beat down pretty deadly at ringside with trash can lids tony d and stacks set up a table to please the crowd pretty deadly sent their opponents into the ringposts pretty deadly carried the table to gorilla position to take it out of play to the dismay of the crowd tony d tackled prince in the shin with a wheelbarrow tony backdropped wilson onto prince into the ball pit stacks got a random float board and used it to hit pretty deadly with a running senton in the ball pit the show cut to pictureinpicture wilson and prince did the charlie brown and lucy football spot with prince giving stacks a pk to the face they yelled its good tony d recovered and hip tossed stacks into a chair set on wilson prince recovered and shoved tony to the mat pretty deadly recovered and put stacks in a tree of woe prince pummeled tony with a steel chair pretty deadly hit tony with a double suplex onto a trash can stacks escaped the tree of woe but lost out on the numbers advantage pretty deadly hit stacks with spilled milk at ringside pretty deadly put stacks in the trunk joseph noted that they needed to put both opponents in teh trunk they were about to put tony in but stacks sprayed prety deadly with a fire extinguisher tony d hit wilson with a crowbar to put him in the trunk tony d and stacks gave a blinded prince a double team spinebuster through a table both pretty deadly members were put in the trunk for the loss tony dangelo and stacks defeated pretty deadly in 1231 via closing the trunk tony d and stacks drove off with pretty deadly in the trunk johns thoughts a fun gimmick match that also had dimensions of being a solid brawl tony d and stacks have already wrestled one variation of the casket match via the prison cell match and this was just as fun with a tornado tag dynamic despite the goofy mafia gimmick both mob dudes are really good brawlers and make the most out of the goofy situation pretty deadly continue to prove why they are one of the best overall tag teams in wwe with their sports and entertainment versatility given how they technically lost a casket match thats usually a sign that they are leaving the territory i wouldnt be surprised if a few losers tonight end up getting hauled to raw or smackdown via the upcoming draft tiffany stratton pulled into the performance center via an suv she hyped up the triple threat womens title match and how she was looking at winning the show cut to andre chase and duke hudson alone at the chase u set hudson tried to encourage chase while chase was being introspective hudson said hes going to be chases support in his match against bron breakker hudson said chase is the pillar of chase u and a beacon of hope for the students of chase u chase fired up and said hes going to give bron breakker a chase u sized ass whooping the show cut to tweets being exchanged dijak and ilja dragunov vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table andre chase and duke hudson were already in the ring bron breakker made his entrance his entrance now has more dog graphics and dog barking sounds i guess because hes a heel now 2 bron breakker vs andre chase wduke hudson chase got the early upper hand with strikes in the corner breakker went for a choke slam but chase escaped breakker gained the advantage after tackling chase into the corner breakker tackled chase into the corners breakker manhandled chase with suplex variations chase managed to sidestep breakker and send him into the ringpost chase dropkicked breakker into the turnbuckle chase hit breakker with a russian legsweep breakker broke up the chase u boots at the h breakker hit chase with a dominator power slam breakker put chase in the steiner recliner for the submission win bron breakker defeated andre chase via submission in 219 a hype package aired to hype up nxt champion carmelo hayes johns thoughts a simple and sweet win to showcase bron breakkers new heel persona him as a heel is a bit of uncharted territory but he was getting stale as a babyface so fresh start chase is teflon and were used to seeing him make his opponents look good mckenzie mitchell was in the parking garage wondering where tony d and stacks drove pretty deadly off to ilja dragunov was entering the garage but was jumped by dijak dijak tossed ilja on all the productioin stuff and tools dijak asked ilja if he feels alive now due to all the pain dijak slammed a garage door on the chest of ilja referees and trainers ran out to send dijak away and save ilja who was writhing in pain under the garage door lyra valkyria made her entrance cora jade made her entrance with her signature black kendo stick 3 lyra valkyria vs cora jade lyra worked on cora with open palm strikes lyra hit cora with a hip toss and flying crossbody for a two count the show cut to pictureinpicture cora had lyra in a butterfly stretch the replay showed that cora got the upper hand after folding lyra like a pancake off a high kick cora hit lyra with a high knee in the corner for a two count lyra rallied with an axe kick combo after cora tried to showboat lyra hit cora with two chained northern lights suplexes cora blocked a third suplex with a knee lyra spilled cora to ringside with a high backdrop lyra hit cora with a wrecking ball dropkick vic joseph plugged the wwe draft booker talked about how he wasnt a huge fan when he was drafted one year lyra hit jade with a perfect plex for a two count cora got a two count off a small package lyra took down cora with a handstand into an enzuigiri cora rolled to ringside to avoid a crescent kick cora hyperextended lyras arm on the 2nd rope the referee prevented cora from using the black kendo stick cora used the ref as a human shield to prevent from getting hit by a crescent kick cora hit lyra with a dirty deeds ddt for the victory cora jade defeated lyra valkyria via pinfall in 819 grayson waller was shown walking through the hallway alongside a shawty holding a shoeie carmelo hayes and trick williams were shown at a different hallway johns thoughts decent match would have liked to have seen more of it outside of the pictureinpicture while they protected lyra a bit im surprised they gave cora a definitive win this early in the feud im not complaining because jade should definitely be the one being pushed out of these two im just a bit surprised because lyra seems to be one of hbks favorites since hes always giving her tv time lyra is missing something she has the cool lucha underground style cinematics and good look but nothing much more than that the show cut to tony d and stacks in the car there was a dashboard camera tony d and stacks were gloating while we could hear noises of pretty deadly struggling in the trunk stacks went to the back to slam the trunk door a few times to shut up pretty deadly entrances for the nxt championship match occurred at the top of the hour alicia taylor handled the formal inring championship introductions melo was wearing lakers colors and kobe bryants 8 on his knee pad go lakers johns thoughts as long as melo wears those laker colors i cant help but be biased in favor of trick and melo kobe 4 carmelo hayes wtrick williams vs grayson waller wunnamed sexy lady for the nxt championship melo dominated the initial sequence with a dropkick melo and waller traded rapid rollups waller told melo to suck it waller hit melo with a straight right melo came back with a springboard crossbody waller avoided a fadeaway kick melo dragged waller in the ring with a neckbreaker waller tripped up melo from the top rope waller tossed a chair in the ring the chair distracted the ref which allowed waller to hit trick with a chair shot at ringside the show cut to pictureinpicture waller put melo in a half crab vic noted that trick was escorted to backstage after the attack from waller melo managed to escape and hit waller with a fadeaway leg drop joseph noted that waller recovered because melo was favoring a leg injury melo hit waller wiht a jawbreaker melo came back with a discus forearm waller and melo took each other out with stereo strikes waller got the two count by putting his hand on melo melo hit waller with a pump kick combo melo hit waller with a high hangtime springboard back elbow vic and booker were super hyped for that springboard move waller rolled to the apron to avoid nothing but net waller gave melo a right hand melo blocked wallers stunner finisher waller hit melo with a crescent kick and sitout bomb for a nearfall a this is awesome chant ensued melo went for a springboard but he fell right into wallers rolling stunner finisher melo rolled to ringside to avoid the pinfall waller cleared the announce table and put melo on it for a viral moment waller hit melo with an impressive froggy bow through the table waller dragged melos dead weight in the ring melo kicked out for a good nearfall melo nailed waller with a codebreaker once he recovered waller rolled at ringside to recover melo was yanked throat first into the bottom rope waller botched the roll on his rolling stunner melo recovered with a kick melo hit waller with the nothin but net scissors kick for the win carmelo hayes defeated grayson waller via pinfall in 1203 johns thoughts similar to the bron breakker match earlier this match was here to present melo under his new character alignment great title defense weve seen both men work heelvsheel before so there was a slightly different dynamic at play here so far so good with melo but i cant wait until his first full program against a rival i had it almost guaranteed that melo was going over in his first title defense almost since nxt has historically made weirdabrupt booking decisions when the wwe draft and callups are involved wallers loss here has me thinking that hes leaving the territory along with pretty deadly maybe we get no callups but im just getting that feeling great showing from waller here too the guy is definitely ready to be called up trick williams returned to the ring to celebrate with melo melo took a mic and challenged bron breakker to a match at nxts battleground ple bron breakkers entrance theme played trick and melo looked a bit dumb for waiting for bron to show up from the ramp as expected bron attacked trick and melo from behind bron stretched trick with a steiner recliner bron then speared melo through a plywood barricade at ringside carmelo hayes got the stretcher treatment johns thoughts simple and effective from brons perfective trick and melo did look a bit dumb waiting for bron to blindside them a roxanne perez sitdown promo aired she talked about how her friends were into makeup and stuff but she was into wwe she said the womens wrestlers were her inspiration roxanne talked about wearing bows in her hair to represent the girls seeing her as inspiration now a replay aired of last weeks bar segment where brooks jensen and kiana james challenged josh briggs and fallon henley to a mixed tag match highlights from their soap opera story aired an ad aired for the upcoming wwe draft joe coffey was on the phone with mark coffey joe gacy showed up to propose a match ava showed up and asked for a gallus vs dyad match for the tag team titles gacy challenged joe to a match where if gacy wins the dyad get their title shot and if coffey wins the dyad dont get any more title shots as long as gallus are champions vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table vic was using his somber voice to sell breakkers attack on carmelo hayes the broken barricade was boarded up joseph noted that carmelo hayes was sent to a local medical facility josh briggs and fallon henley were in the ring kiana james and brooks jensen got their own customized video wall it was dubbing them as kjensen 5 josh briggs and fallon henley vs brooks jensen and kiana james in a mixed tag match briggs refused to attack jensen early on briggs got his first offense with a shoulder tackle and atomic drop jensen hit briggs with a chop lariat in the corner booker kept talking about how brooks was motivated by his horniness brooks was retreating to ringside to recover james and henley tagged in henley hit james with a thesz press james came back with a knee strike fallon hit james with a slam off a standing switch james avoided fallons jump kick james tackled fallon into the corner fallon came back with a jump kick jensen prevented fallon from hitting the baseball slide punch briggs hit jensen with a baseball slide so fallon can hit james with a punch jensen lifted james and shoved her feet into the face of henley henley and briggs gained the upper hand and dumped the heels to ringside heading into pictureinpicture briggs and jensen traded booyay forearms briggs got the upper hand horny booker t gave vic joseph a lecture about love and pheromones joseph asked booker whats love got to do with it henley and james tagged in henley hit james with a blockbuster jensen tagged in and james ordered him to attack her which was not legal in a mixed tag briggs hit jensen with a pounce and rapid strikes briggs hit his standing splash combo on jensen james distracted jensen henley tripped james off the apron and sent her into the steel steps jensen hit briggs with a spinning heel kick jensen and briggs went back to the booyay punches briggs took down jensen with an axe kick jensen came back with a superman forearm jensen caught briggs with a northern and southern lariat jensen hit briggs with a brainbuster for a two count james tossed down henley and handed jensen the designer bag jensen missed hitting briggs with the bag shot jensen accidentally knocked james off the apron briggs hit jensen with a clothesline from hell for the victory josh briggs and fallon henley defeated brooks jensen and kiana james via pinfall in 1143 jensen helped james to her feet and said they were at least still together jensen blocked a slap jensen sand he thought james loved him james said she never loved him james left briggs put a hand on brooks shoulder to console him briggs and jensen hugged it out johns thoughts decent enough match jensen is still a bit green in the ring and it showed when he was up against the more experienced briggs jensen did get better by the end of the match though is this the end of the horny virgin cowboy saga speaking of horny booker was weirdly extra horny in his lecture to vic joseph mckenzie mitchell interviewed dragon lee lee addressed noam dar scouting his matches lee set his sights on the heritage cup championship a random video started playing it was scrypts reggie acting like a gargoyle and cutting one of his lame promos hes going to face axiom one of these days can we just give him back his wine bottle and make him a sommelier again the show cut to the oba femi vignette where hes chucking furniture across a field an indi hartwell promo aired where she was talking to herself in the mirror she talked about being champion being a dream come true she addressed how people see her as a vulnerable champion she said she always dreamed that she would be womens champion and it took years she said even though shes the champ now it can all go away in 3 seconds she smiled and said not tonight vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table vic plugged the nxt battleground ple he then sent the show to another nxt anonymous video sol ruca was dragged behind a door and beat down the cameraperson ducked before we can see the culprit oba femi made his entrance a stat graphic aired to show his impressive fitness feats his opponent was oro mensah poor oro 6 oba femi vs oro mensah oro tried to swarm oba with quick strikes oba chucked oro across the ring oba hit oro with an european uppercut in the corner oba hit oro with shortarm shoulder tackles oro escaped obas shortarm slam oba took down oro with a chop oba dumped oro to ringside with a uppercut oro adjusted his weight to block a suplex oro worked on oba with gut shots oro rallied with right hands and a liger kick oro hit oba with a springboard jump kick oba kicked out at two femi was favoring his arm oro gave femis arm a pk oba recovered and hit oro with a discus forearm oba hit oro with an impressive power bomb for the win oba femi defeated oro mensah via pinfall in 335 johns thoughts wowzers this guy has future world champ written all over him the guy looks like a million bucks he moves extremely well in the ring he has amazing strength great first impression they did allow oro to get a bit of offense in but hbk and crew seem to be a bit high on him theyre onandoff with his whole clubber persona and it looks like oro is in level up mode right now anyways the right guy went over and im looking forward to see how oba femi develops in the ring eye test wise hes passed gigi dolin showed up and took vics headset to cut a promo gigi called out jacy for berating her for abandoning her family she said shes been fighting to get her brother out of an abusive household gigi said shes going to kick jacys ass and gigis brother will be at ringside to see it all mckenzie mitchell interviewed charlie dempsey and drew gulak about charlies last loss dempsey said nobody knows about the last loss but the last win gulak said that charlie exposed wes lees weaknesses and inferiority complex gulak said that hell beat wes lee for the north american title because its a marathon not a sprint tiffany stratton made her entrance an ad aired for the wwe draft episodes of smackdown and raw wes lee was chatting with tyler bate in the locker room bate noted that hes worried about wes lee wearing himself out lee was confident that hell take care of drew gulak next week bate offered to be in lees corner to offer a bit of balance lee accepted it to help cancel out charlie dempsey bate offered to give lee some breathing exercises before the match the rest of the entrances for the main event took place with 5 minutes left at the top of the hour alicia taylor handled the formal inring championship introductions 7 indi hartwell vs roxanne perez vs tiffany stratton for the nxt womens championshipperez and hartwell alternated strikes on stratton all three women traded rollups heading into the pictureinpicture tiffany had roxy in an armbar while hartwell was off to the side resting near the ramp perez rolled up tiffany into a bridge for a two count perez dropkicked hartwell off the apron stratton blocked roxannes huracanrana with a handstand hartwell took down both opponents with a lariat indi body slammed both opponents perez got a two count

stomp hartwell reversed strattons stomp into a rollup for a two count stratton dumped both opponents to ringside with a dropkick stratton took out both opponents with a swanton bomb to ringside a trainer ran out to check on indi hartwell tiffany worked on roxanne with methodical offense it felt like the air was taken out of the room as the crowd went silent due to the injury at ringside perez and stratton were brawling in the center of the ring but the crowd seemed distracted by hartwell perez hit stratton with a jawbreaker stratton came back with a knee perez and stratton traded methodical offense perez rallied back with right hands stratton rolled through a crossbody perez rolled up stratton for a nearfall stratton and roxanne traded forearms at the top rope perez hit

count hartwell continued to sell a injured leg stratton hit perez with a body slam stratton hit perez with a mero sault hartwell broke up the pin hartwell hit perez with a basement forearm for the win indi hartwell defeated roxanne perez and tiffany stratton via pinfall in 1512 to retain the nxt womens championship the show cut to tony d and stacks dumping someone into the lake presumably pretty deadly tony said they were setting their sights on the tag team titles tony d and stacks drove off to celebrate the show closed johns thoughts the match was good until the awkward swanton spot i cant tell if it was the nxt creative team going into workshoot mode or if there was a legit pop in indis knee after she contorted during tiffanys flip what made it look legit was the way the announcers were selling it the crowd going silent and tiffany and roxanne seemingly putting a match together on the fly my workshoot suspicions stem from it feeding into indis vulnerable champ persona but to me this seemed legit because it led to awkwardness a pretty good themed episode of nxt with some good matches a good debut by oba femi and solid action the only real downside was whatever happened to indi hartwell at the end hopefully it was just a minor pop or dislocation and that it wasnt anything huge hartwell going over means she was the one pegged to win and they thankfully didnt have to come up with a new finish on the fly if hartwell lost i would have assumed she was getting called up now i think of the three tiffany stratton is most likely to be called up if any of these three are

callups via the wwe draft the video package included new footage of the nxt callups giving short promos on their callup vic joseph and booker t were on commentary entrances for the opening match took place 1 wes lee wtyler bate vs drew gulak wcharlie dempsey for the nxt north american championshiplee dumped gulak to ringside early on dempsey got on the apron for the distraction which allowed gulak to get a two count rollup gulak reversed a leapfrog into a rollup lee recovered and hit gulak with a double stomp and low kick combination gulak blocked a superplex lee did a backflip to avoid a punch gulak hit lee with a diving uppercut for the two count joseph noted that its rare you see gulak dive from the top rope gulak dragged lee to the mat for a snug two count gulak tangled lee like a pretzel in a hammerlock crossface lee used his free hand to escape both men traded slugging blows lee backed gulak down with a cqc combo and basement shotgun dropkick lee swarmed gulak with strikes in the corner gulak used the corner to drag himself to ringside to recover lee caught gulak with a suicide dive while gulak distracted the referee dempsey dragged lee to ringside tyler bate gave dempsey a diving uppercut from the steps lee recovered and gave gulak a cardiac kick for the victory wes lee defeated drew gulak via pinfall in 522 to retain the nxt north american championship highlights from last weeks carmelo hayes vs grayson waller match were shown which ended with bron breakker spearing melo through a drywall barricade trick williams was walking through the hallways backstage heading to the ring johns thoughts short and sweet match that said it was almost too short given weve seen both men kill it in matches that go over 15 minutes the match didnt do much for gulak who hasnt really done much on tv since his return to nxt i would like to see him show both the inring and the character stuff that he was doing when he was given the ball on 205 live during the era where paul levesque took over the show from vince lee gains a little bit a good little bit though as he gets another notch in his belt as the fighting champion nxt dodged a bullet by not losing lee to the main roster lees main roster ready with plenty of tv experience via impact wrestling nxt is blessed to have him as an attraction with his fighting champion thing the show cut to isla dawn and alba fyre the nxt womens tag team champions in their dark witchcraft room fyre and dawn talked about being drafted to smackdown and how this is their last official night in nxt dawn talked about how theyre taking the belts to smackdown and will be changing the fate of all three brands fyre said theyll leave nxt not in light but in darkness after playing with an ouija board and blowing out candle lights both women laughed trick williams was in the ring by himself trick talked about how melo is in the hospital due to the spear from bron breakker trick said that melo was not only his dayone in nxt but his dayone in high school trick talked about transferring into wj kennan high school he said when he transferred he was looking for the shawtys at first but then looked out to who he was going to roll with trick said when they met nasty ass sloppy joes werent the first thing being created in the cafeteria but the trick and melo relationship happened trick said that da trick and melo game will always be here he said he took a bullet for melo last week as a kneejerk reaction trick said that trick and melo be like shaq and kobe where if melo misses trick will be there for the rebound bron breakker made his entrance in all black bron bragged about putting melo in the hospital trick wondered if bron was accepting melos battleground challenge bron said hes tired of fighting for the stupid people ever again bron said hes excited to embarrass melo in front of melos hometown bron accepted the match and told trick to send the message to melo trick told bron to handle things like men right now bron said theres only one man in the ring now he said he already put melo in the hospital and he might have to put the mouthpiece there trick said he has the gift of gab and the jab trick said if he steps up hell knock the tan off bron til brons black and blue bron said it doesnt matter what anyone wants bron challenged trick to a match next week bron said that next week will be a preview to battleground and trick will be broken in half johns thoughts great promo by trick here he really outshined bron here which is not surprising given how consistent trick has been on the mic outside of the story theres no shame being a strong hype man and mouthpiece theres thousands of good wrestlers out there good managers and hype men are a dying breed tricks still rough in the ring when we see him but i hope he really gets a chance to thrive as a talker hey ddp started off as a manager and eventually became a great wrestler late in his career mckenzie mitchell interviewed jd mcdonagh about his last nxt match being againt dragon lee today jd daid hes been waiting a long time for monday night mcdonagh nxt heritage cup champion noam dar showed up and asked jd to break one of dragon lees ligaments jd said he understands that noam is slimey he said that noam always feared having jd challenge for the cup jd told noam to stand back or else hell take the heritage cup to monday night raw gigi dolin made her entrance she high fived her brother who was sitting in the front row a tiktok was shown of dani palmer hyping up her nxt debut jacy jayne made her entrance 2 gigi dolin vs jacy jayne jayne hit gigi with a knee to the gut gigi dumped jacy to ringside jacy caught a pk and tripped gigi on the apron jacy hit gigi with a cannonball jacy taunted gigis younger brother jacy got a two count on gigi booker t talked about how its unwise to bring family into this business says the man that tag teamed with his brother in harlem heat i kid i kid gigi rallied back with superkicks on jacy gigi hit jacy with two face wash crescent kicks and a legsweep for a two count booker t then compared his time in prison to the dark times that gigi went through thats a better allusion than his family one gigi slammed jacy on the steel steps and gave her kawada kicks gigis brother cheered on gigi jacy yanked gigi into the exposed turnbuckle jacy hit gigi with a cyclone kick for the victory jacy jayne defeated gigi dolin via pinfall in 320 jacys face was bleeding and covered in a crimson mask jacy dragged gigi to ringside and slammed her on the steel steps jacy put the boots to gigi while yelling at gigis brother asking him if this reminds him of his abusive mother the referees ran out to send jacy to the back vic joseph hyped axiom vs scrypts for after the break johns thoughts a short match but way better than their last one which ended anticlimactically understandable because jacy got a minor injury from the match jacy jayne continues to surprise the world as the star to come out of the toxic attraction trio when she was considered the third on the depth chart of that group wwe usually gets nervous over blood spots but they allowed it here whens the last time we saw a crimson mask on wwe tv they didnt even roll out the random medics with gloves im pretty sure this wasnt a blade job because it wouldnt have made sense in the context of the match vic joseph plugged the wwe2k game axiom made his entrance in his white ranger attire scrypts didnt want an entrance and instead just flipped in the ring from the side to start the match 3 axiom vs scrypts axiom hit scrypts with a suplex and put him in a juji gatame at ringside scrypts ran off the announce table and hit axiom with the reggie side flip that was actually impressive axiom put scrypts in a sleeper which scrypts escaped scrypts hit axiom with a high hanging moonsault axiom rallied back with stiff knife edge strikes axiom hit scrypts with a suplex scrypts caught axiom out of the air with a dropkick axiom blocked a kick and reversed a backflip into a leaping knee for a two count scrypts avoided a golden ratio and hit axiom with a corkscrew crossbody axiom reversed the mollygoround with a superkick axiom hit scrypts with a golden ratio superkick for the victory axiom defeated scrypts via pinfall in 416 out of respect axiom helped scrypts to his feet scrypts gave axiom a cheap shot right hand axiom knocked out scrypts with a stronger right hand axiom ripped off scryptss mask booker said you know who that is right the crowd chanted reggie johns thoughts on one hand this is weird nxt over the past few months has been treating scrypts like hes the 2nd coming of shockmaster which he kinda is i do like that it makes axiom look like a powerful badass which was fun to watch axiom did get the best he could out of reggie who continues to struggle to have longer matches because his athleticism is way above any of his opponents its hard to cooperate i hope the unmasking in the end means were getting an evolved version of reggie can we get him his wine bottle back in all seriousness because of his extreme athleticism he can probably be more of a jackie chanesque babyface which weve havent seen in pro wrestling josh briggs and brooks jensen were hanging out with bartender fallon henley at her bar all three apologized and were happy to be back together jensen told henley that hes learned business and henley can actually refinance or do partial investments in the bar some shawtys in the bar asked jensen if he wants to have a drink with them jensen said hell have to pass because hes catching up with briggs and henley after the girls left henley was impressed by jensen growing up dragon lee made his entrance wwe raw wrestler jd mcdonagh made his entrance 4 dragon lee vs jd mcdonagh jd and dragon started the match started the match with chain wrestling booker t claimed that he personally thinks mcdonagh is the best pick in the draft jd hit dragon with a chop and put him in a headlock dragon hit lee with a reverse mule kick and got a two count dragon hit jd with a slingshot yakuza kick lee worked on jd with grounded palm strikes lee hit mcdonagh with two hesitation dropkicks mcdonagh knocked down lee when noam dar showed up at ringside mcdonagh put lee in the tree of woe mcdonagh sent himself crotch first into the ringpost when he went for a basement dropkick after lee did a core situp lee hit mcdonagh with an atomic drop and dumped him to ringside the show cut to pictureinpicture noam dar was shown talking to his inanimate heritage cup mcdonagh dragged lee to the top rope mcdonagh tried to disrespectfully remove lees mask dragon shoved mcdonagh off the top rope and hit mcdonagh with a high crossbody block dragon hit mcdonagh with a huracanrana dragon then hit mcdonagh with a flip dive after being given a special camera angle dragon lee hit mcdonagh with a warriors way double stomp for a two count mcdonagh and lee traded chops on the apron dragon gave mcdonagh a high knee mcdonagh recovered and hit dragon with a death valley driver on the hardest part of the ring mcdonagh recovered and slammed lees face on the annoucne table at the count of 8 lee quickly rolled into the ring to beat the count lee recovered and hit jd with a kick lee hit mcdonagh with a snap german another move a poison rana all in succession mcdonagh turned lee inside out with a lariat lee and mcdonagh traded strikes in the center of the ring dragon hit jd with an elevated sitout power bomb for the two count mcdonagh crotched dragon on the top rope both men traded strikes on the top rope dragon put mcdonagh in the tree of woe but mcdonagh recovered with headbutts mcdonagh hit dragon with a top rope spanish fly mcdonagh hit dragon with a brainbuster suplex dragon lee kicked out at two dragon reversed a devlin side into a canadian destroyer noam dar tried to get a cheap shot in but took a superkick from lee mcdonagh yanked lee in and hit him with the devlin side for the victory jd mcdonagh defeated dragon lee via pinfall in 1500 jd posed on the corner soaking in thank you jd chants dragon lee gave noam dar a suicide dive and they brawled to the back johns thoughts wonderful takeover level match and strong sendoff for jd mcdonagh nxt usually sends off callups with a loss see pretty deadly and grayson waller last week but my guess is this is shawn michaels tipping the cap to one of his proud proteges jd took that cap tip and ran with it by putting on a great match against one of the top wrestlers in the world in dragon lee if jd is like a son to hbk i would argue that alba fyre is like a daughter i wonder if well see fyre and dawn get a similar sendoff later kayden carter and katana chance were warming up in the locker room katana talked about how the womens tag team match is a raw vs smackdown match katana talked about how they are the longest reiging womens tag team champions in all of wwe kayden said that they are going to go out of nxt with the titles the schism were watching joe coffey working out with galluss theme in the background joe gacy told reid and fowler that hell win them their tag title shot reid and fowler thanked gacy after the dyad left ava told gacy that while gacy is doing this for the dyad gacy needs to look out for himself sometime and do something for himself soon a video package was shown that replayed some of the mystery attacks that happened inthe most dangerous place in all of wwe the nxt parking lot johns thoughts i still say that the attackers are the same ninjas that attacked samoa joe at the universal studios orlando parking lot that one time entrances occurred for the battle between two guys named joe 5 joe coffey wmark coffey wolfgang vs joe gacy wjagger reid rip fowler ava coffey and gacy pummeled each other with stiff strikes in the corner coffey got a two count off a crossbody coffey blocked a senton with a knee lift gacy hit coffey with a uranage for a two count coffey hit gacy with a flying shoulder tackle and saito suplex for a two count gacy came back with a punch and saito suplex for a two count coffey hit gacy with a southpaw punch coffey hit gacy with a flying pounce fowler put gacys leg on the bottom rope for the break the dyad and gallus brawled at ringside ava got in the ring for the distraction this allowed gacy to hit coffey with a handstand lariat for the two victory joe gacy defeated joe coffey via pinfall in 322 the creeds and ivy nile were watching the match shaking their heads ivy nile left saying that shes sick of the schism always winning like that johns thoughts ugh im not a fan of this joe coffey just got here and hes already losing matches yes they went with the overbooked protection but thats what it was overbooked i dont think it was worth sacrificing joe coffey in order to try again with the crap ass schism faction joe coffey should be protected because hes a main event player hes a good talker and very good in the ring the guy needs to be set up as a nxt championship contender dany palmer was stretching backstage by doing the splits she was talking to sol ruca on facetime hank walker and tank ledger showed up and cheered on dani for her next match oba femi walked through the room looking intimidating eddy thorpe was interviewed in the performance center about his workout he was describing his workout damon kemp showed up and told thorpe to throw away his water bottle because hes the new guy thorpe said thats a funny joke kemp said the joke will be thorpe thinking he can hang with kemp in the ring thorpe said hell take that bet kemp called thorpe a young boy and told him to not make him end eddys hype dani palmer made her entrance to some generic 70s rock music she did backflips to the ring tatum paxley was already in the ring 6 dani palmer vs tatum paxley dani and tatum traded standing switches both women then traded methodical chain wrestling dani flipped out of the corner and hit tatum with a frankendriver dani put tatum in a grounded headlock tatum landed a clubbing blow to the back of dani tatum hit dani with a gutwrench german for a two count tatum hit dani with a standing corkscrew elbow drop for a nearfall tatum put dani in an abdominal stretch dani reversed it and dodged an elbow drop dani hit tatum with a few flying back elbows dani hit tatum with a neckbreaker dani hit tatum with a shiranui dani hit tatum with a frog splash for the victory dani palmer defeated tatum paxley via pinfall in 358 johns thoughts not a great match this reminded me of some of the early nxt 20 matches where you have two developmental wrestlers struggling to go belltobell to danis credit she was the better looking one her i dont want to dis tatum but she hit a progression wall while ago i think shes better served being kept off tv and putting in reps on the house show loop what they should have done is find a local florida enhancement talent with indie experience the show cut to the chase u classroom thea hail was nervous because andre chase didnt make it to class duke hudson volunteered to be the guest teacher hudson taught the students about the wwe draft one student asked duke if there was going to be a pop quiz today duke told everyone to lift up their quiz papers and ripe it duke got cheers duke said that duke university has a nice ring to it vic said isnt there already a duke university nice line the wrestlers in the womens tag team title match were shown heading to the ring robert stone and von wagner were sitting down going through the beau beverly family photo album wagner talked about beau competing in wembley stadium for the wwe tag team championships they flipped to von wagners baby photo which he was embarrassed by wagner walked off not wanting to open up stone opened the album and saw a baby von with a lot of medical implements on him entrances for the womens tag team title match took place vic plugged the nxt battleground ticket sales alicia taylor handled the formal inring championship introductions vic joseph wondered if the winner of this match will have to do double duty on raw smackdown andor nxt there was 15 minutes left at the top of the hour and some overrun time allocated 7 alba fyre and isla dawn vs katana chance and kayden carter for the nxt womens tag team championshipsboth tag teams brawled before the bell carter and chance got control when dawn tagged in chance and carter hit their opponents with plancha dives to ringside the show cut to pictureinpicture chance hit fyre with chops and a liger kick to the back for a two count chance and carter traded tags to cut the ring in half on fyre and keep a numbers advantage fyre caught chance with a foot lift and caught carter with a jawbreaker fyre and dawn hit chance with their backstabber swanton finisher carter shoved fyre onto dawn to break up the pin carter hit fyre with a cross rhodes chance rolled up dawn for the two count chance hit dawn with a codebreaker chance and carter hit dawn with their deathdrop 450 finisher fire shoved carter on chance to break the pin on dawn all four women tagged in for a hockey fight fyre gave carter a superkick and pk chance shoved dawn into the ropes to crotch fyre carter tagged in and brawled with fyre to the top rope chance and carter hit fyre with a double spanish fly to give carter a nearfall on fyre chance and carter went for their finisher but chance had to hit dawn with a crossbody fyre recovered and used chance as a batering ram on carter dawn and fyre hit chance with a double team gory special dawn picked up the victory on chance isla dawn and alba fyre defeated katana chance and kayden carter via pinfall in 912 to retain the nxt womens tag team championships the commentators wondered if the womens tag team titles will be exclusive to smackdown because of dawn and fyre saying that the spirits told them that johns thoughts not quite the takeover level match but that was one hell of a effort both teams stuffed a lot of moves into a shortish amount of time not all of it looked great but the effort definitely shined i almost feel like we would have gotten a more epic match if dawn and fyre had more of a workrate team to work with because chance and carter are more spotlucha based the show cut to a dijak promo where he was recording himself with a voice recorder he talked about smashing the ribs of ilja dragunov dijak said ilja looked helpless instead of being a mad dragon he said he can break any man and hell break ilja next week nxt womens champion indi hartwell was shown walking through the hallway with her title belt and walking with crutches vic joseph hyped up the wwe backlash press conference featuring bad bunny for this friday trick williams was in the parking lot where he gave apollo crews a congratulatory dap for getting called up to raw crews said he sees a lot in trick and thinks trick can take over this place he said that trick is the definition of a superstar he told trick that if he keeps busting his ass hell be called up next year trick said that means a lot both men shared a dap hug dijak vs ilja dargunov and gallus vs the dyad for the nxt tag team championships were advertised for next week indi hartwell was in the ring with new entrance music she soaked in you deserve it chants indi talked about joining wwe at 23 years old 1330 days ago she said she had a hope and a dream and was a fan of the black and gold nxt she said nxt produced legends like bayley and asuka she said women like that made the nxt womens title one of the top titles in the industry she said she never thought she could be a champion until she found the way she said she found papa johnny candice austin theory and sexy dexy dexter lumis she said she was shocked that her wwe wedding had no interruptions she said she was also shocked that she won the title at stand and deliver she said everyone says they want to be a fighting champion but not everyone can she talked about how she was dragged to the medical room with a high angle sprain but she dragged her self out saying hell no she soaked in indi wrestling chants she talked about defending the title with one leg and then getting drafted to raw the next few days she said she cant believe her new home is raw she said that starting next week theyll be a tournament to crown a new champion and the new champion will be crowned at battleground indi wished the competitors luck she said she wanted to share a quote she lives by dont cry because its over smile because it happened an indi wrestling chant ensued indi kissed the title and laid it on the ground indi joked that she needs to figure out how to get out of the ring with one leg when indi left dexter lumis popped up from under the ring with a thumbs up dexter carried his wife to the back tiffany stratton entered tthe ring and took the belt cora jade showed up and played tugawar the womens locker room cleared and the show closed with a locker room brawl johns thoughts wowzers i would have never thought that indi hartwells nxt departure would be so hartfelt she may not be the smoothest in the ring but shes a low key master at the character work its very subtle shes not overthetop shes natural sucks that she never got to finish the story of her title run but i give nxt and her credit for making the most of the little time she did have as the beatable champion trying to shed that stigma her winning the match on one leg was one of those moments like cody rhodes wrestling with a bloody boob or kurt angle winning a gold medal with a broken freakin neck badass im actually intrigued to see if they can do some solid work now that the way are mostly together on the main roster though the way did struggle a bit when they lost austin theory playing the role of johnny garganos 8 year old son so far baby theory is best theory a really good episode of nxt at multiple levels the primary level seemed to be focusing on a few of the farewells of the show the womens title match was good what stole the show was jd mcdonaghs farewell match against dragon lee nxt is going to be interesting because if the evil moustache meddler vince sticks around nxt might be the safe haven for good pro wrestling on wwe and national tv i say this because aew does have a lot of pacing and personnel issues they have to fix and i want aew to succeed one thing that would help is whenever wwe starts hiring again they havent even signed people from their mania weekend college recruit tryouts yo if

tv reviews by jake barnett prowrestlingnet cosenior staffer barnettjake wwe friday night smackdown episode 1236 corpus christi texas at american bank center aired live april 28 2023 on fox the smackdown introduction aired and a video package played that introduced the 2023 wwe draft michael cole mentioned a sellout in corpus christi and wade barrett hyped up the main event wrestlemania rematch between sami zayn and kevin owens vs the usos for the unified wwe tag team championships triple hs music hit and he walked out to kick off night one of the wwe draft he stood at a glass lectern set up for the draft on the stage triple h introduced some rules every superstar on raw and smackdown are subject to the draft 50 of the roster will be drafted tonight and the other half will take place on raw the draft pool was shown on the screen it included people like roman reigns becky lynch cody rhodes bianca belair and others triple h then added that select nxt superstars will also be available and the rosters will go into effect the monday after backlash triple h announced that he had the first four picks in his hand they were as follows 2023 wwe draft night one round one paul heyman solo sikoa and roman reigns to smackdown as the bloodline cody rhodes to raw bianca belair to smackdown becky lynch to raw after the first round of the draft triple h introduced the usos who walked out and stood at the same lectern that triple h was just standing at jimmy congratulated roman reigns on being the 1 pick in the 2023 draft both usos said they would bring some gold back to the bloodline and said he hasnt responded to any of their efforts to talk to him since wrestlemania they closed by saying that kevin and sami are the twos and they were the ones sami and kevin then walked out on stage and there was a face to face confrontation sami said he wasnt there to talk sense to them but he had one thing left to say he asked them if they thought it was strange that roman hadnt said a word to them since wrestlemania and they were out there dedicating their match to him sami then asked if they noticed that they werent drafted as a part of the bloodline he then said they would walk out as the tag team champions jey said they would walk out with nothing and jimmy added that kevin would turn on him when it was over owens finally piped up and said he didnt care what happened to them or what they thought they were going to get them in the ring and beat them up to retain their titles the announce team went over the main event again the brawling brutes then made their entrance in the arena butch will face la knight next my take wwe decided to split up reigns and cody so he immediately goes on the shortlist of people who would be expected to go deep in the tournament for the new world championship if the usos get drafted to raw and dont win back their titles later i would imagine jey uso enters that tournament as well two doors representing the draft rooms from raw and smackdown were shown backstage nxt talent was then shown sitting in a draft room in the performance center bianca belair checked in with a pretaped promo where she spoke about her excitement to return to smackdown la knight made his entrance for the next match video was shown backstage of knight antagonizing butch backstage and sheamus challenging knight to take on butch tonight 1 la knight vs butch both men ran the ropes early and butch landed a running forearm he then performed some finger manipulation and stomped on knights hand butch then landed clubs to the chest over the top rope knight got back into the match by catapulting butch into the ropes and then landed back suplex on the ring apron my take it was pretty obvious that indi hartwell was in a walking boot in the shots of the performance center confirming she suffered some sort of injury on tuesday butch landed a kick and another running forearm he then stomped on knights fingers and landed a kick to the back of the head for a near fall knight got back into the match by performing an impressive leap to the top rope followed by a superplex the crowd chanted for knight but butch shut him down with an enziguri knight fired back with a running kick but butch avoided blunt force trauma and applied an armbar knight fought his way to the ropes and broke the hold he then quickly landed blunt force trauma and got the win la knight defeated butch at 832 after the match paul heyman told the usos that they would be drafted to the island of relevancy or to obscurity he said roman gave them tonight as their only opportunity to wipe off the stain on the bloodline that was created by sami zayn and kevin owens at wrestlemania he then handed a roll of athletic tape to solo and said tonight was the night no matter what solo began taping up his finger jey wasnt enthusiastic about the way heyman was speaking to them and jimmy appeared motivated by the talk rob van dam was shown as a special presenter for raw coming up next and michael hayes will announce picks for smackdown my take decent match to start things off heymans body language and choice of words made it appear that the usos needed a win tonight or they would be handled by solo sikoa and removed from the bloodline rob van dam made his entrance for the next round of the wwe draft he was followed by michael hayes 2023 wwe draft night one round two the street profits to smackdown imperium giovanni vinci ludwig kaiser and gunther to raw edge to smackdown matt riddle to raw the street profits made their entrance in smackdown blue ford acknowledged they were back in the blue and said nothing had changed but the night they worked on and they still wanted the smoke ricochet and braun strowman followed and then finally the lwo represented by cruz del toro and joaquin wilde 2 montez ford and angelo dawkins vs cruz del toro and joaquin wilde vs ricochet and braun strowman there was chaos early on where strowman cleared everybody from the ring and then he and ricochet had a brief meeting about last week before strowman threw ricochet over the top rope and onto the opponents on the floor my take imperium to raw is good news gunther is another guy i would put at the top of the list for the new world championship ricochet and del toro double teamed dawkins momentarily del toro landed a missile dropkick that sent dawkins to the floor he then avoided an attack from ricochet and sent him into the corner turnbuckle joaquin wilde then tagged in and landed a springboard dive onto the street profits on the outside wilde then landed a hurracarrana into a pin on ricochet strowman entered the match and took out wilde del toro and and ford he then ran around the ring and knocked them all over a second time dawkins flew over the top rope and absolutely smashed strowman with a dive ricochet then followed with a dive onto dawkins ford then tossed ricochet back into the ring and landed a huge frog splash and got the win the street profits were victorious at 752 after the match a video package was shown that recapped the backlash feud between bad bunny and damian priest bad bunny will be on smackdown on puerto rico next week jbl will represent smackdown in the next section of the draft and teddy long will represent raw my take they couldnt let teddy long represent smackdown what kind of conspiracy is this jbl made his entrance followed by teddy long they made the next set of picks in the wwe draft 2023 wwe draft night one round three bobby lashley to smackdown drew mcintyre to raw the oc luke gallows karl andreson michin aj styles to smackdown the miz to raw zelina vega made her entrance in a very elaborate headdress sonya deville was already in the ring and accompanied by chelsea green 3 zelina vega vs sonya deville wchelsea green there were some clumsy moments early on deville landed a kick and some body shots in the corner vega used a tarantula hold in the corner to get in some offense chelsea green distracted her on the outside which resulted in deville getting control back with an ambush both women traded some fairly basic back and forth offense until vega surprised deville with a rollup and got the win zelina vega defeated sonya deville at 312 after the match rhea ripley kicked vega from behind she then landed a headbutt to sonya deville she then went for a riptide on vega but she reversed into a ddt and ran away up the ramp the main event was hyped up for later my take not much of a match there and what was there felt like it lacked chemistry hopefully wwe can give vega a bit more underdog fire next week in puerto rico i must admit that i didnt believe the oc was still a thing backstage rey mysterio and santos escobar gave zelina vega a pep talk backstage rey told her that he was smaller than all of his opponents but he fought all the way to the hall of fame escobar told her to bring the title home to the lwo in the arena the oc made their entrance with aj styles making his return mia yim karl anderson and luke gallows followed along before they could say anything valhalla and the viking raiders made their way out to the ring aj had a microphone and told them to hold on a second he asked if they walked out to pick a fight he then said he was going to back up into the corner and he told the oc to handle their business mia yim quickly sent valhalla packing and anderson and gallows dumped ivar and landed the magic killer on erik styles said they were just getting started and landed a phenomenal forearm on ivar before leaving hbk was shown making some picks for smackdown and road dogg will make picks for raw my take they got a lot of work ahead of them to heat up gallows and anderson but its good to see aj back id like to see another match between him and reigns honestly hbk and road dogg entered to dx music together 2023 wwe draft night one round four damage ctrl bayley dakota kai iyo sky to smackdown shinsuke nakamura to raw alba fyre and isla dawn to smackdown indi hartwell to raw mckenzie mitchell interviewed isla dawn and alba fyre at the performance center they said they were excited to dominate wwe smackdown katana chance and kayden carter then challenged them for a nxt women tag team title match on tuesday and they accepted shinsuke nakamura was then interviewed by kayla braxton it lasted 5 seconds as he was attacked and sent into a set up shipping crates by karrion cross backstage the usos asked solo to come out to the ring with them and heyman let them know that reigns has asked that the focus tonight be on the usos tonight and solo would remain in the back solo stared at his taped thumb as the usos walked off owens and zayn made their entrance in the arena my take some interesting nxt choices there and not the ones i expected i wonder if well get more draft picks after the show released on social media a video was shown of wwe introducing a new world heavyweight championship on raw cole announced that the draft will continue tomorrow morning on smackdown lowdown on peacock and then the rest of the roster will be eligible for draft on mondays raw shinsuke nakamura vs karrion cross was announced for smackdown next week plus the oc vs the viking raiders the usos made their entrance for the main event samantha irvin made ring introductions 4 the usos jimmy and jey uso vs sami zayn and kevin owens for the undisputed wwe tag team championships the usos jumped owens and zayn as they handed their belts to the referee they threw zayn into the ringpost on the outside and then landed superkicks on owens jimmy made a cover after a double superkick and got a two count jimmy uso wrapped owens leg around the ring post sami zayn paced on the apron in hopes of a tag jey tagged in and continued the attack but owens broke free and made a tag to zayn sami dumped both usos to the floor and then landed a big dive onto both men on the floor he then tossed jey back into the ring and climbed to the top rope jey got to his feet and landed a punch and then both men battled on the turnbuckle zayn landed a sunset flip powerbomb and covered for a near fall zayn continued the offense with a blue thunder bomb for a close near fall he then went back up to the top rope but jey popped up and kicked him out to the floor ko landed a cannonball on jimmy uso in the corner he climbed up top but jimmy met him up there owens pulled out a fishermans buster out of the corner and climbed the ropes for a swanton out of the opposite corner for a near fall heyman was shown backstage receiving a call from roman reigns he thanked him for the call and told solo that the tribal chief has decided tonight is his night owens landed a pop up powerbomb on jimmy but jey broke up the fall sami zayn dumped jey from the ring and dove over the top rope but jey caught him with a superkick owens landed a stunner on jimmy in the ring and he kicked out at 29 solo sikoa made his way out to the ring but matt riddle appeared from out of nowhere and took solo out of the picture and backstage somewhere the usos landed a double superkick on owens and jey covered for a close near fall the usos landed a double superkick to both zayn and owens and jimmy covered owens for another near fall jey tagged in and landed another kick and owens got busted open at some point he got to his feet and kept fighting the usos set up for 1d but zayn pulled jey from the ring and sent him into the ring steps owens landed a stunner on jimmy and tagged zayn for a heluva kick and a victory sami zayn and kevin owens defeated the usos to retain their championships at 1738 after the match owens and zayn celebrated as the show went off the air my take itll be interesting to see how monday goes it seems that the new conflict in the bloodline will revolve around solo sikoa and where his loyalty lies will he choose his brothers or roman reigns and when will he make his choice another element to watch is how they approach the tag team titles as it seems like the roster split would give them an opportunity to split them up again and try to get more mileage out of a tag division that was largely sacrificed in order to add more prestige to the bloodline the additional draft picks coming up should make that a bit more clear ill be back a bit later with my smackdown

performance center aired live may 9 2023 on usa network nxt started out with a recap of indi hartwells nxt farewell promo where she recapped her nxt career culminating with winning the nxt championship fighting through an injury to complete a title defense and ultimately getting drafted to wwe raw vic joseph and booker t were on commentary alicia taylor was the ring announcer the eight wrestlers wrestling in the womens championship tournament were all lined up on the entrance ramp vic joseph noted that shawn michaels and the performance center coaches selected the women to compete in the tournament entrances for the opening match took place both women got pictureinpicture promos to hype up their match 1 tiffany stratton vs gigi dolin in a first round match of the nxt womens championship tournamentgigi worked on tiffany with uppercuts and kicks gigi got a two count after a jackknife pin gigi got another two count after a pk joseph noted that gigi was injured and was sporting kinesio tape on her left shoulder tiffany recovered and hit gigi with a running double stomp on gigi tiffany worked on gigi with methodical offense and pin attempts vic plugged bron breakker vs trick williams as the main event gigi got a rollup in but tiffany regained control after working on gigis injured shoulder gigi rallied back with clinch knees and lariats gigi took down tiffany with a pump kick tiffany turned the tables with a shoulder breaker on the injured shoulder tiffany hit gigi wtih a backflip into a back elbow gigi came back with a cross kick tiffany regained control by attacking the injured shoulder tiffany hit gigi with a rolling senton tiffany hit gigi with what she calls the prettiest moonsault ever which is the best moonsault ever used by christopher daniels for the win tiffany stratton defeated gigi dolin via pinfall in 429 to advance to the semifinals of the nxt womens championship tournament the gallus trio were shown walking through the hallways they then cut to joe gacy and ava coaching the dyad on their upcoming match after the dyad left gacy told ava that hes taking avas advice to look out for himself gacy said he wont be joining the dyad and will be handling some of his own business gacy asked ava to help support the dyad in his absence johns thoughts a nice short match that didnt overstay its welcome as a first round match they did lay it on thick by giving gigi an out with the kinesio tape on her shoulder and the announcers pointing it out my guess is she attacks jacy jayne during her opening match against roxanne perez looking at the brackets it looks a bit obvious whos advancing but that might lead to some swerves like seth being the clear favorite on the raw championship bracket tiffany stratton stands out as the clear favorite here i wouldnt mind if they build up cora jade enough to become the top heel of the division the show cut to trick and melo getting a cut at the barber shop melo talked about how hes not 100 cleared to wrestle but he really respects trick having his back melo said trick didnt have to do that trick said it aint no problem and hes been training his hardest to beat bron breakker the patrons of the shop cheered on trick trick asked melo not to worry because his biggest test is about to be at battleground trick said he has his biggest test on this weeks nxt trick gave melo a dap handshake as they both said their thats how it is catchphrase entrances for the next match took place alicia taylor was about to do the formal inring introductions but a brawl ensued before that the bell rang anyway 2 gallus mark coffey and wolfgang wjoe coffey vs the dyad rip fowler and jagger reid wava for the nxt tag team championships mark coffey dominated reid after a body slam booker noted that he likes gallus as an old school brawler throwback wolfgang tagged in and took down reid with a double team lariat stacks and tony dangelo appeared on the crows nest reid gained control with a rally of forearms this allowed him to tag in the fresh rip fowler fowler worked on wolfgang with methodical offense wolfgang kept a low center of gravity to block and reverse a suplex mark tagged in and worked on rip with shortarm strikes reid blind tagged in which allowed the dyad to swarm mark with dropkicks the dyad hit mark with a russian legsweepenzuigiri combo for the two count the show cut to pictureinpicture the dyad used quick tags to cut the ring in half on mark a pictureinpicture popped up where ivy nile was watching the match julius and brutus trolled ivy by showing up with blue schism masks ivy nile berated them for the joke mark managed to backdrop jagger to bring in wolfgang for the hot tag wolfgang beat up both opponents two on one wolfgang hit reid with a bodyslam and running senton combo mark tagged in as gallus hit reid with a double team uranage for a two count on jagger fowler pulled mark away to prevent gallus from hitting their finisher wolfgang regained control in the ring mark tossed rip into the announce table ava got on the apron to allow reid to hit mark with a ddt off the wheelbarrow ivy nile ran out and attacked ava which distracted rip this added distraction allowed wolfgang to hit rip fowler with their samoan dropdropkick combo to give gallus the win gallus defeated the dyad via pinfall in 1103 to retain the nxt tag team championships joe coffey channeled his inner stone cold by telling his teammates oh hell yeah coffey said they are all heading to the pub for dranks thea hail was hanging out with a few of the students in chase u backstage big body javi javier bernal showed up to antagonize hail for not being in the womens title tournament duke hudson showed up with his mvp trophy he said he was grading papers and wondered if speel check exists in australia hudson said hail scored an 88 on her test hudson called out javi for not being a part of chase u hudson said javi was disrespecting dukeer chase university chase then set up a duke hudson vs javier bernal match for later in the show johns thoughts a good tag team match for what it was both teams are still missing something from a character perspective gallus continue to be very vanilla as character and really need to find a way to showcase the charismatic joe coffey at the forefront the dyad were charismatic as the grizzled young veterans at points now theyre a bit dull and coming off as lame ducks after requesting their release hey at least james drake finally found a voice at the expense of zack gibsons voice if joe isnt going to go after the main title at the moment maybe he can go after the heritage cup title a vignette aired for a hooded figure in a dark room this person was watching clips of all the women who have been mystery attacked in the nxt parking lot over the past year this is presumably the culprit nxt_anonymous entrances for the next match took place vic made sure to plug nxt battleground ticket sales 3 duke hudson wthea hail vs big body javi javier bernal vic joseph claimed that chase university serves some good chicken parm in their cafeteria javi stalled by running away which allowed him to put the boots to duke when hudson entered the ring javi mocked the chase u hand pose which allowed duke to come back with a shoulder tackle and body slam javi came back with a dropkick to the hamstring and ddt javi got a one count after a basement lariat javi put duke in a chinlock hail led the crowd in an mvp chant hudson escaped with a snapmare duke then hulked up after javi gave him right hands duke did the chase u handsign during hogans you portion of the hulk up hudson then hit javi with the dusty bionic elbow combo hudson hit javi with an impressive slingshot german suplex hudson hit javi with a razors edge for the win duke hudson defeated javier bernal via pinfall in 357 hudson posed with his mvp trophy in the ring johns thoughts good to see big body javi back in the ring the guy went from being on tv every week to missing in action javi is one of nxts unsung heroes with his comedy work i still see him as the 2nd coming of heath slater if wwe pushes him right robert stone and von wagner were chatting backstage stone quizzed von on his favorite foods von said he likes bacon burgers chili cheese fries and cookies and cream ice cream stone said he likes pistachio ice cream stone then tried to ask von about that picture from last week where baby von had a serious head injury and scars a random douchebag developmental wrestler tried to make fun of vons head troubles von pressed the man against a production crate the man ran away and called von a freak von scoffed at stone for liking pistachio ice cream eddy thorpe made his entrance johns thoughts theyre really dragging their feet with this whole von wagner story but better late than never i guess im actually intrigued with them seemingly reaching into some real life trauma to flush out vons character real life trauma seems to be the well that nxt does for a lot of wrestlers but realism works i wonder if wwe is still high on him they made him a free agent they also had that random callup as adam pearces bodyguard last year that went nowhere gallus ran into the creeds and ivy nile at the performance center kitchen area joe asked nile to stay out of gallus business in the future joe held back mark and wolfgang from starting a fight joe said they are going to the pub champions only invited the creeds joked around with ivy after gallus left 4 eddy thorpe vs damon kemp eddy dominated the initial chain wrestling sequence with an arm wrench slam kemp dominated the next stretch with a few belly to back slams eddy ran the ropes and came back with a snapmare takedown joseph described thorpe as a gym rat thorpe caught a running kemp with a high hop standing crossbody kemp came back with a goldust right hand punch kemp hit eddy with a rebound jackhammer for a two count kemp talked some smack to eddy while working with methodical offense kemp tripped on the ropes after hitting eddy with a cartwheel dvd for a two count thorpe came back with chops and gut punches eddy rallied back with a cqc and enzuigiri combo eddy hit kemp with a german suplex in the corner for a two count eddy was selling a shoulder injury kemp quickly broke a half crab with a rope break kemp dragged the ring skirt to the center of the ring for some reason thorpe hit kemp with a dropkick and standing elbow drop for the victory eddy thorpe defeated damon kemp via pinfall in 457 damon kemp was complaining about something after the match to the ref johns thoughts good showing for thorpe is this it i was looking forward to damon kemp back on tv maybe him complaining will lead to another match im just wondering why hes received so little tv time after the diamond mine ended he showed so much promise as a pest heel and is solid in the ring with his amateur background mckenzie mitchell interviewed kiana james about being hand picked by shawn michaels to compete in the womens championship tournament james talked about lyra valkyria being a tough bracket she talked about how successful her first year was and how she can imagine her 2nd year in wwe as becoming nxt womens champion ilja dragunov made his entrance at the top of the first hour mckenzie mitchell interviewed bron breakker about his change in attitude bron said he didnt change he just stopped caring he said carrying the fans and brand on his back led to nothing bron said the fans chose melo bron said melo is still ripping out splinters from being speared through drywall bron said if mckenzie doesnt like his attitude she can leave bron then went to the camera and said hes going to put trick williams in the same hospital as melo he ended the promo by saying see ya at battleground johns thoughts hey he called it a hospital as opposed to a local medical facility vince mcmahon is clearly not watching thank god dijak made his entrance for the next match 5 dijak vs ilja dragunov ilja caught a big boot and hit dijak with a jump kick ilja then hit dijak with chops against all four corners ilja no sold a chest chop and rallied back with his own knife edges ilja pummeled dijak with rapid stiff chops in the corner until dijak begged for mercy ilja hit dijak with a top rope knee drop dijak got a breahter after shoving ilja to ringside dijak put ilja in a waistlock ilja no sold a roundhouse and gave dijak a enzuigiri in response ilja got dijak back to the mat with stiff strikes dijak held on to the top rope to prevent a deadlift german suplex dijak hit ilja with a smapmare and discus boot for a two count dijak brought a chair into the ring dijak tossed the referee into the corner for a ref bump the ref still had enough wherewithal to see dijak hit ilja with a steel chair for the dq ilja dragunov defeated dijak via dq in 426 dijak continued to beat up ilja at ringside dijak choked ilja by standing on top of him while he was trapped in the gap of the steel steps dijak laughed and asked ilja if he still feels alive after all this pain dijak got in the camera and said he can break any man even the mad dragon tyler bate was sitting in the locker room which he turned into a sauna wes lee showed up and said he hasnt seen this much smoke in the locker room since he hung out with matt riddle wes thanked bate for having his back in the match last week lee said he has bates back in his match later lee said bates match was next bate ignored lee bate woke up and said he was just in a higher trance lee and bate shook hands and left to the ring johns thoughts nxt doesnt overdo the dq finish so this was fine to stretch out the dijak vs ilja feud dijak vs ilja dragunov might be a match wwe considers putting on in the big arena at battleground no need to waste it on weekly tv dijak proved he can have a show stealer on a ple and weve seen ilja do the same vic joseph plugged positive reviews for the wwe 2k game the show cut to dani palmer on tiktok talking to briggs and jensen about what she needs to do now that shes debut briggs and jensen said that dani needs more reps hank walker and tank ledger hank and tank asked briggs and jensen for a match so they can get reps briggs and jensen agreed johns thoughts random side note last year before hibernation season a giant chonky ass california black bear was terrorizing northern california and lake tahoe ransacking homes the locals named the bear hank the tank thats what i thought of when i heard hank and tank entrances for the next match took place 6 tyler bate wnxt north american champion wes lee vs charlie dempsey wdrew gulak bate slammed dempsey early on for a two count dempsey got a two count after a bridged double underhook suplex both men traded quick rollups and ended in a stalemate both men then took each other out with stereo headbutts bate and dempsey traded strikes in the center of the ring bate hit dempsey with a michinoku driver after a helicopter spin joe gacy confronted wes lee at ringside bate took out gulak and gacy with a top rope clearing dive bate hit dempsey with bop and bang gacy gave bate a cheap shot right hand when he went for his rebound lariat dempsey hit bate with a bridged dragon suplex for the win charlie dempsey defeated tyler bate via pinfall in 326 vic joseph and booker t checked in from the commentary table they sent the show to carmelo hayes on twitter where he was watching bron breakkers promo from earlier melo was at the barber shop after he heard the promo he stormed off from the barber shop saying he has to have his boys back briggs jensen and henley made their entrance mckenzie mitchell interviewed dragon lee about how he attacked noam dar after his loss last week lee said that dar sees lee as a threat which is why he told jd mcdonagh to attack him noam dar interrupted the interview via the tv screen behind mckenzie dar said he comes bearing gifts he bragged about being the longest reigning heritage cup champion he said he was offering dragon lee the opportunity to be a part of his talk show supernova sessions dar said he awaits lees response lee told mckenzie ill be there johns thoughts i guess with grayson wallers waller effect talk show gone they needed to fill in the talk show void somehow hank and tank made their entrance 7 josh briggs and brooks jensen wfallon henley vs hank walker and tank ledgerhank and tank swarmed briggs with heavy power moves briggs regained control after a back suplex on hank jensen tagged in and hit hank with a double team shoulder tackle body slam and elbow drop booker talked about how jensen was recovering from the pheromones hank made a comeback with a running shoulder tackle vic talked about being impressed by how stiff this match was tank hit jensen with a stinger splash in the corner joseph talked about hank and tank bonded over eating meatloaf together and being division i linemen briggs hit tank with a big boot after jensen held him down tank picked up his tooth from the ground and put it back in his singlet jensen held up tank so briggs could hit him with a lariat jensen picked up the pinfall brooks jensen and josh briggs defeated tank ledger and hank walker via pinfall in 339 a replay aired of tank losing his tooth after the big boot the show cut to one of lyra valkyrias cinematic promo vignettes she was shown working out in the city she talked about how the cityscape is different from her forests in ireland she said she has three women marked on her quest to the womens championship she said kiana james is her first mark johns thoughts as i noted earlier the brackets look very predictable lyra talking about looking past kiana with other marks on her hitlist adds to the predictability that said there may be a twist maybe looking forward to lyra getting more development now that the womens division has had some losses via injury and the draft she does show promise because she comes off well during these lucha underground style cinematic vignettes whos producing her cinematics because they seem solely only available to her an ad aired for wwes ae sunday night block the show cut to nathan frazers hard hitting home truths news segment where he is doing a john oliver impersonation frazer talked about how 17 stars were called up to the main roster he said the hard hitting truth is that spots have opened up in nxt for people to step up now he listed off nxt wrestlers from being all around the world he mentioned chase u as a university and said it counts as global due to hudson being australian frazer talked about noam dar having his own talk show from nxt uk he noted that he made his wwe debut on supernova sessions he said that dars show was meant to stroke dars ego while hard hitting home truths is meant to expose the lies from frauds like noam he replayed dar getting superkicked after trying to interfere in dragon lees match last week nathan talked about how dar treats the heritage cup as an actual baby frazer said thats strange behavior frazer said one day dar wont have his baby anymore and his whole world will come crashing down frazer handled the outro to his news segment johns thoughts i want to hate these news segments because its a carbon copy ripoff but nathan is delivering the material so well that i cant help but like them not sure how being wrestlings john oliver will translate to the squared circle but im willing to see how they pull that off seth rollins was a pretty eh promo when he entered wwe developmental and is now one of wwes best it would be pretty cool to see one of his proteges reach the same feats entrances to the next match took place 8 lyra valkyria vs kiana james in a first round match of the nxt womens championship tournamentboth women started the match with chain wrestling and rollups lyra got a nearfall after hitting kiana with a twisting armdrag kiana sent lyras throat into the 2nd rope with a wheelbarrow kiana whipped lyra into the ringpost heading into pictureinpicture kiana worked on lyra with body stretches lyra escaped with a monkey flip lyra got a two count off a rollup booker said that jensen should have just went along with the ride and stayed quiet to stay with kiana lyra caught kiana with a missile dropkick lyra rallied back with a kick combination james came back with a knee lyra backdropped kiana to ringside lyra hit kiana with a wrecking ball dropkick lyra hit kiana with a enzuigiri after missing a dive kiana kicked out of a bridged northern lights at two kiana caught a diving lyra with knees kiana hit lyra with a power bomb for a two count lyra caught kiana with a crescent kick out of nowhere for the win lyra valkyria defeated kiana james via pinfall in 851 to advance to the semifinals of the nxt womens championship tournament an updated championship bracket was shown johns thoughts both women worked hard here and it was a solid match i still am higher on lyras opponents than her because lyra hasnt really stood out in the ring yet she hasnt really established a character much either other than she likes to do freerunning a lot in various landscapes might just take time i continue to be more impressed by the tyler breeze student kiana james shes going to be the sista to look out for in 2023 now that a handful of spots have cleared in the nxt roster after the draft the show cut to gallus drinking pints at the pub is this fallon henleys bar tony dangelo and stacks congratulated gallus on their last title defense joe kept snapping at tony tony talked about having fun at their last hangout stacks talked about how he and tony would have been champions if joe coffey didnt interfere tony asked for a rematch joe rejected the rematch and threatened tony and stacks with a shillelagh tony was about to stop a fight but stacks held him back saying that they were outnumbered by gallus and the bar tony said hell get a title rematch somehow trick williams made his entrance the crowd gave him a whoop dat trick chant roxanne perez vs jacy jayne and fallon henley vs cora jade was announced as the tournament matches for next week vic joseph also plugged the redebut of supernova sessons happening next week with dragon lee as the guest bron breakker made his entrance because hes a heel now he has random dog bark sounds in his entrance the match started at the start of the overrun 9 bron breakker vs trick williams trick rallied early on with dropkicks and shoulder tackles trick wouldnt let bron come back and continued with the right hands and tackles in the corner trick dumped bron to ringside with a pump kick and yakuza kick trick gave bron overhead forearm strikes trick was about to toss bron into the timekeeper chair but breakker turned the tables by backdropping trick on the announce table bron slowed things down in the ring with some ground and pound bron tossed trick with a backdrop bron tossed aroudn trick with suplexes a bron breakker sucks chant ensued in the tune of john cena sucks after a suplex bron broke up his own pin and mocked trick with pushups bron put trick in a grounded abdominal stretch trick got a few right hand blows in but bron quickly ended the comeback with a spinebuster a bron is neutered chant ensued i think trick came back with a yakuza kick and twisting neckbreaker trick hit bron with a dropkick and flying lariat trick hit bron with a book end for a two count bron reversed a tornado kick into a power slam trick fended off bron with a handstand roundhouse and boots trick went for a tornado kick and twisted right into a spear by bron bron put trick in the steiner recliner trick didnt immediately tap but did once bron wrenched it in bron breakker defeated trick williams via submission in 639 after the match bron put trick back in the steiner recliner nxt champion carmelo hayes ran out for the save melo went for a springboard crossbody but was caught mid air by a spear from bron breakker bron breakker took the nxt title and went to melo bron said that melo is holding something that belongs to him and at battleground breakker will be champion again breakker tossed the title on melo and stood tall to close the show johns thoughts not bad indeed good work from all the players involved here trick williams and bron breakker in particular were undergoing specific tests here for bron this was his first test as the veteran of the match and first big test as a heel he led trick to a very compelling match and came off very strong for trick this was his first match as a babyface and the biggest match of his wwe career to date i didnt know what to expect but nxt has been hyping the guy up for weeks id have to say trick williams did pretty well in his first big nxt match he was decent in the ring the best part of the match was how he had the crowd rallying behind his babyface rallies and comebacks trick showed me here that he hasnt hit a developmental wall given how he does have the gift of gab and can only get better with his gift of jab trick has the potential to be a breakout rookie in 2023 or 2024 this is why wwe shouldnt rush developmental because longterm investment equals big time fruits short term investment leads to bitter tasting nasty unripe fruit nxt continues to be a sleeper hit week to week where nxt falls a bit is star power and green wrestlers but the storytelling and character development is there to hbks credit i respect his love for drama and character development his one weakness is he does sometimes go overboard with the melodrama but we all have our weaknesses hey hunters weakness is excessive uses of heavy metal listen to pro wrestling boom podcast on spreaker we value your privacy privacy policy info here

why cant the main roster women put on that type of compelling match it wasnt perfect but it had me on the edge of my seat and when ts landed the first moonsault and lyra moved at the last minute i
