Wade-era access to abortion in the state is slated to appear on the November 2023 ballot.\n\nThe initiative was defeated by a decisive margin of 57% to 43% amid unusually high voter turnout for an off-year election held in August, with over 3 million ballots cast overall.\n\nBackground \n\nIssue 1 was proposed by State Representative Stewart and the state's top election official, Secretary of State Frank LaRose. According to Stewart, Issue 1 is intended to stop \"far-left ballot proposals\" and \"ballot campaigns [featuring] destructive policies that [liberal groups] could never get through a state legislature\", while according to LaRose, Issue 1 is \"100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution\". LaRose later claimed that his statement was taken out of context and generally called the issue a \"good government\" move that blocks influence from out-of-state special interests.\n\nThe amendment was supported by the Republican Party of Ohio and opposed by a multipartisan coalition of groups including the Democratic Party of Ohio, Libertarian Party of Ohio, Green Party of Ohio, and several former Republican officials; with the former claiming that the amendment was necessary to prevent advocacy groups from lobbying their interests into the state constitution, and the latter arguing that the amendment was undemocratic and would result in minority rule. Four former governors of Ohio, John Kasich, Ted Strickland, Bob Taft, and Dick Celeste, favored a \"no\" vote on Issue 1, along with a large majority of Ohio newspapers, who argued that Issue 1's passage would have the effect of centralizing power in the state government and limit the power of voters to effect political change. Incumbent Republican governor Mike DeWine supported it.\n\nThe issue was widely seen as being related to the issue of abortion in Ohio, as a referendum to restore legal access to elective abortion in the state would be held in November 2023. Thus, the scheduling of the Issue 1 vote was seen as an attempt to raise the success threshold before the abortion vote could take place. In addition, advocacy groups also attempted to use the referendum as an attack to LGBT rights, mainly, transgender rights.\n\nThe decision to hold the election in August as opposed to November was criticized as an attempt to help the amendment's passage by capitalizing on historically low voter turnout in special elections. In fact, the Ohio General Assembly had passed, and Governor DeWine had signed, House Bill 458 just months earlier, among the provisions of which eliminated August special elections except in cases of fiscal emergency; the stated rationale for this provision, given by Secretary of State Frank LaRose and others at the time, was the consistently low turnout seen in historical August elections. After the Issue 1 vote was scheduled for August 2023, LaRose defended this apparent contradiction by saying that HB 458 does not apply to state legislators, who are free to select any date they wish for a referendum on a constitutional amendment they refer to voters. Democrats rebutted this point, saying that legislators should have chosen from a list of election days that had already been set. A lawsuit was filed over the timing of the election, but on June 16, in a 4â€“3 ruling, the Ohio Supreme Court agreed with LaRose's interpretation and decided the election would continue as scheduled. The election cost state taxpayers $20 million.\n\nSimilar amendments to require supermajority support for state constitutional amendments have failed in various states, most recently in Arkansas in 2022. A comparable measure passed in Florida in 2006.\n\nIn June 2023, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that part of the amendment was misleading and would have to be rewritten by the state's Ballot Board.\n\nPolitical scientist Jacob M. Grumbach claimed the passage of Issue 1 would likely lead to democratic backsliding, citing the proposed measure as among a \"growing use of moves that defy norms of democratic behavior\".\n\nProvisions \nIf approved by voters, the amendment would have changed the Ohio State Constitution, modifying the Initiative and Referendum Process Amendment of 1912, which created a method for citizen-initiated direct democracy in Ohio.\n\nA \"yes\" vote on Issue 1 was a vote to change the Ohio Constitution by:\n Requiring signatures from all 88 counties to get an amendment on the ballot, instead of the current 44 counties (50%).\n Removing the 10-day cure period (a period allowing fixes to any errors in the collected signatures).\n Increasing the passing percentage from a simple majority (50%+1) vote to a three-fifths supermajority (60%) on citizen and legislature-initiated referendums.\nHad the amendment passed the second and third  provisions would have taken effect immediately, while the first provision would have taken effect on January 1, 2024.\n\nA \"no\" vote on Issue 1 was a vote to keep the Ohio Constitution as is, by:\n Keeping the number of counties from which signatures are required to get an amendment on the ballot at 44 counties (50%)\n Keeping the 10-day cure period.\n Maintaining the passing percentage of a citizen-initiated referendum at a simple majority (50%+1 vote), without creating a difference between citizen-initiated referendums and legislature-initiated referendums.\n\nEndorsements\n\nPolling\n\nTurnout and outcome \nVoter turnout was unusually high, particularly for an August ballot, with approximately 39% of registered voters casting votes on the issue. The Columbus Dispatch reported that it was the highest turnout for a non-general election since the 2016 primary. \n\nExcluding outstanding absentee by mail and provisional ballots, the Dispatch reported late on August 8 with more than 99% of the votes counted that the referendum failed by a margin of more than 14%. Of the more than 3 million votes counted, 57.11% were \"no\" votes and 42.89% voted \"yes\". Decision Desk HQ, an election results reporting agency, called the race around 8:09 p.m. EDT, while The Associated Press projected that Issue 1 had failed around 9 p.m. EDT.\n\nReferences \n\n2023\nOhio Issue 1, 08/2023\nAugust 2023 events in the United States\n2023 in Ohio\nU.S. state constitutional amendments\nConstitution of Ohio\n2023 Ohio elections\nElectoral system ballot measures in the United States", "unikey": "August 2023 Ohio Issue 1", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Provisions", "Endorsements", "Polling", "Turnout_and_outcome", "References"], "contents": ["Issue 1 was proposed by State Representative Stewart and the state's top election official, Secretary of StateFrank LaRose.According to Stewart, Issue 1 was intended to stop \"far-left ballot proposals\" and \"ballot campaigns [featuring] destructive policies that [liberal groups] could never get through a state legislature\", while LaRose stated that it was \"100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution\".LaRose later claimed that his statement was taken out of context and generally called the issue a \"good government\" move that blocks influence from out-of-state special interests.\nThe amendment was supported by theRepublican Party of Ohioand opposed by a multipartisan coalition of groups including theDemocratic Party of Ohio,Libertarian Party of Ohio,Green Party of Ohio, and several former Republican officials; with the former claiming that the amendment was necessary to preventadvocacy groupsfrom lobbying their interests into the state constitution, and the latter arguing that the amendment was undemocratic and would result inminority rule.Four former governors of Ohio,John Kasich,Ted Strickland,Bob Taft, andDick Celeste, favored a \"no\" vote on Issue 1, along with a large majority of Ohio newspapers, who argued that Issue 1's passage would have the effect ofcentralizing powerin the state government and limit the power of voters to effect political change.Incumbent Republican governorMike DeWinesupported it.\nThe issue was widely seen as being related to the issue ofabortion in Ohio, asa referendum to restore legal access to elective abortion in the statewould be held in November 2023.

fight over ballot initiatives this summer after republican ohio lawmakers voted last month to set an aug 8 election to make it harder to change the state constitutionbut ohio is just part of a broader national battle over ballot issues generally pitting republican state lawmakers against backers of leftleaning policies many of which have fared well at the ballot boxohio will be the third state in the past two years to hold a vote on raising its approval threshold for state constitutional amendments from 50 to 60 last year republican state legislators in arkansas and south dakota placed similar measures on the ballot this year missouri nearly became the fourth state to do so like in ohio in response to a looming abortionrights measure  but it unexpectedly failed to follow through before the end of its legislative sessionthe fight over ballot issues began to pick up around a decade ago when a coordinated push happened across the country to use the process to expand medicaid the governmentfunded healthcare program for the poor and disabledit got hotter in response to progressive criminalsentencing reform ballot measures across the country like a 2018 ballot measure in florida that restored votingrights to people convicted of certain feloniesand its intensified even more after the us supreme court voted last year to overturn roe v wade setting off a series of abortionrights related ballot measures in states across the countrythis process began before roe v wade said sarah walker the policy and legal advocacy director for the progressive ballot initiative strategy center but it absolutely accelerated and magnified the issue especially after reproductive victories happened across the country in red and blue states we expect these attacks on democracy are going to continuethe trend has led progressive ballot issue organizations which saw a string of successes across the country in direct votes to expand medicaid eligibility and raise the minimum wage to pivot into what they call direct democracy defense  helping fend off measures like the ones in ohio arkansas and south dakotawe think the outcome of what happens in ohio will send a strong message one way or the other said walker whose group is advising the campaign to defeat the 60 measure and my hope is that its not in the best interest of those in power to try to undermine the will of the people through undermining the citizens initiativestate issue 1 if voters approve it would change the state constitution to require that future amendments get a 60 statewide supermajority in a statewide vote in order to passthats compared to the current 50 simple majority standard thats been in place for more than a century it also would make it harder for potential ballot issues to qualify by tightening mandatory signaturegathering requirements for amendment campaignsvoting yes on the issue would approve the changestate rep brian stewart a pickaway county republican who was instrumental in getting state issue 1 on the ballot said the measure is needed to head off leftwing policy that he said is out of step with ohiobesides social issues he cited ballot potential initiative pushes to end qualified immunity the legal liability protection for police officers and rankedchoice voting which dramatically overhauls the system of choosing candidates through primary elections and a possible future push to hike the minimum wage all have been proposed with varying degrees of seriousness in ohioi would say over the last 15 years theres definitely been an increase in what a lot of republicans and conservatives would consider to be farleft ballot proposals stewart said some have not passed but there does seem to be a shift nationally and amongst liberal groups that theyre going to focus more of their energy and more of the national spending on trying to achieve through ballot campaigns destructive policies that they could never get through a state legislaturetheres also more oneoff proposals stewart said like the one former ohio house speaker larry householder attempted to get on the ballot in 2020 that would have changed term limits in a way that would let him remain in office for another decade details of the scheme which failed in large part due to the coronavirus pandemic only came to light after householder was arrested on federal corruption chargesits disturbing to see how easy it is to sort of buy a slot on the ballot stewart said and once youre there a lot of things can happen if the legislature gets it wrong we can fix it once you put something in the constitution its generally there to stayohio is among the 19 us states that allow voters to directly pass law changes either through a constitutional amendment or through whats called an initiated statute according to the national conference of state legislatures the other states are arizona arkansas california colorado florida idaho illinois maine massachusetts michigan missouri montana nebraska nevada north dakota oklahoma oregon and south dakota each state has their own rules for the process including different required percentages for amendments to be approvedinterest groups with increasing sophistication have used the ballot initiative process for decades to advance their cause du jour ohio offers a representative crosssection the state voted in 1992 to establish term limits for state lawmakers it voted in 2004 to ban samesex marriage and it voted in 2009 to legalize casino gamblingin more recent years ohio voters recently have rejected wellfunded citizeninitiated amendment campaigns that have popped up elsewhere in 2015 they rejected a marijuana legalization measure and in 2018 they rejected a measure that would have loosened criminal sentences for drugrelated crimes proposed amendment campaigns fizzled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic one that would have expanded voting rights and another that would have raised the minimum wage to 13 an hourone national group that works on ballot amendment campaigns is the fairness project a progressive organization with ties to organized labor it has advised successful campaigns raising the state minimum wage in nine states since 2016 arizona arkansas california colorado maine massachusetts missouri nebraska and washington and expanding medicaid eligibility in seven states idaho maine missouri nebraska oklahoma idaho and south dakotabut last year the fairness project pivoted to what it calls ballot measure rescue campaigns it won in what so far are two major test cases for trying to make it harder to change state constitutions helping defeat the proposals in arkansas and south dakota the group boasts on its website that its won 31 of our 33 ballot measures to raise wages stop predatory payday lenders expand health care access secure more paid time off and other lifechanging policies for more than 18 million peoplethe group is advising ohios opposition campaign said desiree tims president of innovation ohio a liberal thinktank in columbustheyre able to provide examples on what went right and what went wrong states and how we can coordinate and convey information to the public said tims who sits on the fairness projects advisory committeearkansass ongoing fight over ballot issuesin arkansas voters in 2018 overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure hiking the states minimum wage from 850 an hour to 11 an hour voters also approved measures legalizing casino gambling and requiring photo id to votein 2020 voters approved a ballot measure setting term limits for state legislators lawmakers also put up for a vote an amendment that would tighten the rules for the signatures initiative campaigns must collect from voters in order to make the ballot it failedbut that didnt stop lawmakers from trying again in 2022 referring the states 60 supermajority amendment for a votestate rep david ray a republican who pushed for the measure said at the time the higher threshold would provide there is a genuine consensus among voters when the state amends its constitution or passed an initiated statuteour state constitution is entirely too easy to amend and we should not amend it in sort of a willynilly fashion four five six times every two years like we currently do said ray according to the arkansas democratgazettethe measure failed obtaining just 41 from arkansas voters it appeared on the ballot alongside another extremelywell financed marijuana legalization amendment that overwhelmingly failedthe anti60 campaign protect ar constitution raised 782000 leading up to the november 2022 election according to the arkansas democratgazette its major donors included the fairness project and the national education association the major teachers union the similarly named opposition campaign defend ar constitution which ray chaired raised just 78000bonnie miller president of the arkansas league of women voters led the campaign to defeat the measure the groups ads described the proposal as ending majority rule in arkansas and empowering lobbyists it was a counter point to the pro60 ads which said making it harder to change the constitution would protect the document from big special interest outofstate groupsmiller said voters didnt start off knowing much about the constitutional amendment process but it wasnt that hard of a sella lot of people dont think about it but i will say direct democracy is very important to arkansans miller said we historically have been a very populist state and people may not understand the politics of how everything works but they understand direct democracy and they like it so getting folks to understand the importance was not difficultmiller said lawmakers in arkansas keep trying to restrict ballot issues because they feel threatened by democracyreform proposals like changing the redistricting system or implementing rankedchoice votingray and other arkansas lawmakers voted this year to tighten signaturegathering requirements in a similar fashion to the 2020 measure that voters defeated the arkansas league of women voters has suedwe believe politicians who are in power they want to stay in power and they want to keep it miller saidmedicaid expansion prompts 60 vote in south dakotain south dakota legislative leaders acted to try to head off an expected november 2022 ballot measure expanding medicaid eligibility they scheduled a june election requiring a 60 supermajority for any measure that would have a fiscal impact of more than 10 million over five yearsit was widely understood to be targeting the medicaid issuei just thought it should be harder to tax and spend your money rep jon hanson a republican who sponsored the measure said at the time according to the sioux falls argusleader frankly our state should have done this a long time agothe opposition campaign there was funded by local organized labor groups but also by hospitals that stood to gain financially from the measure the states three largest healthcare systems provided nearly half of the 15 million raised by the opposition campaign south dakotans for fair electionsthe 60 proposal called amendment c failed by a twotoone margin while the medicaid expansion amendment passed the following november with 56 supportzachary nistler a former democratic operative who served as a media spokesperson for south dakotans for fair elections said the opposition campaign succeeded in part because it was able to marshal support from the businesses community using its representatives as figureheads for the campaignthey really took the spear and then there was a lot of messaging around dont change a system that wasnt broke nistler saidhe also said the states conservative electorate didnt hold against them that the ballot initiative processes has been used in south dakota to advance relatively progressive policies in like medicaid expansion in part because theres a populist streak in south dakota politicsi think voters enjoy having an active role in deciding important policy components for their government nistler said its a smaller rural state but in general i think they view putting the power in the hands of the people as really important i think the ballot initiative process really affirms thatmissouri vote fizzlesheading into their legislative session this year missouri state lawmakers appeared poised to follow ohios lead by asking voters to raise the threshold for approving constitutional amendments the missouri proposal would have required a 57 votevoters the past november had voted to legalize recreational marijuana with 53 of the vote groups there also are organizing a 2024 ballot measure that would restore abortion rights in missouri after a near totalabortion ban went into effect shortly after roe v wade was overturnedbut the 57 measure inexplicably stalled in the state senate the legislature ended its 2023 session in may without taking actionas the measure stalled republican house speaker dean plocher predicted that if the threshold was not raised the 2024 abortionrights ballot measure would pass according to the associated pressthe senate should be held accountable for allowing abortion to return plocher saidmarilyn mcleod president of the missouri league of women voters said in an interview that it was stunning when the measure failed she said the missouri lwv had been planning an opposition campaign but now plans to revisit the issue when it comes up again next yearmcleod said that in the late 1980s and early 1990s when democrats dominated the state legislature missouri state lawmakers tried to pass laws restricting the initiative petition processgov john ashcroft a republican who later became us attorney general vetoed two bills one in 1991 and one in 1992he made a statement that initiative petitions are the voice of the people and we shouldnt squelch it mccloud said  all of a sudden we have a

issues because they dont want to spend any time listen to our opinion or gather any signatures here there are a lot of issues coming down the pike so to speak pertaining to constitutional amendments the issue might be abortion today tomorrow it might be recreational marijuana the next day it could be animal agriculture it could be a minimum wage requirement weve got to be aware of the fact that whenever we start changing our state constitution and putting things in there they need to be issues that are overwhelmingly supported  i dont want to see us turn into a state where we have outofstate interests and money dictating what we do and dont do in the state of ohio and thats why were giving ohioans an opportunity to decide state rep ron ferguson r96 if its a true ohioled citizen initiative if ohioans want it it shouldnt be very difficult to find some people in every single county that want it it should block out those big money interests and really not be a hindrance to citizenlet ballot initiatives joe condit founder of catholic speakers organization this entire issue boils down to protecting parents and the rights they hold with their children its time parents of all religions play offense and vote yes on aug 8 the opposing side has masterminded a campaign to trick the christian side to think a no vote protects the constitution a winning vote in august will help set the state for best protecting parental rights in november former secretary of state ken blackwell r the us constitution carefully crafted for durability has allowed our nation to flourish for the past 245 years in large measure thats due to the fact that its not easy to amend one of the weaknesses of ohios constitution on the other hand is that currently it is far too easy to amend steve stivers ceo of the ohio chamber of commerce yes vote on issue 1 will protect ohioans from those seeking to enact antibusiness policies like the current effort to massively increase ohios minimum wage and eliminate the tipped wage stivers also said while we support protecting our constitution in august this has everything to do with subjects like minimum wage employment atwill and other business issues chris ferruso state director for national federation of independent business in ohio the ohio constitution should not be an easy target for groups seeking policy changes harmful to ohios proud network of small and independent businesses a yes vote on issue 1 will subject highly impactful constitutional changes to a higher standard of vetting and show the residents of our state that ohio is open for business state rep brian stewart r12 there is a reason that every far left group in ohio is fighting so hard to preserve their ability to do an end run around us  the elected representatives of the people  to amend the ohio constitution by a bare 50 plus 1 vote margin after decades of work to make ohio a prolife state the left intends to write abortion on demand into ohios constitution if they succeed all the work accomplished by multiple republican majorities will be undone and we will return to 19000 babies being aborted each year state sen theresa gavarone r2 ohioans elect state representatives state senators and a governor to create policy for the state if elected leaders support good policies then their voters will likely reward their efforts by reelecting them if elected leaders support bad policies then their voters will likely opt to replace them in fact if the legislature or governor is not doing what ohioans want citizens already have the ability to initiate policy changes at the ballot box that will not change under issue 1 the ohio revised code ensures that policy can be altered based on what ohioans want  even in heated times ohios constitution is meant to defend our rights and was never intended by founders to be changed in the heat of the moment or at the whim of what outofstate millionaires or billionaires feel is in their best interest ohio farm bureau this ballot measure is not specific to any particular issue it is about getting all corners of the state involved when a constitutional amendment that would impact all ohioans is at stake for too long many of ohios rural communities have been overlooked and not had a voice on what amendments to the constitution may be considered secretary of state frank larose r constitutions do not exist for daytoday legislating  things like casinos or raising the minimum wage or maybe trying to do something that would make it harder for farmers to run their operations  or something like this radical abortion amendment that is being considered this november sportsmens alliance in modern america antihunters have billions of dollars at their disposal so what issue 1 is really about is protecting the ohio constitution against radical outofstaters and their extremist ideologies they want to come to ohio buy ballot victories and stuff their ideology down your throat we must stop them ballot issues are our greatest vulnerability for one reason  they are almost always won by the side with the most money michael gonidakis president of ohio right to life weve got cities like cleveland columbus cincinnati and were a midwestern state a test market state people bring their products here to see if it sells and outofstate special interests say hey a big market lets go put a few bucks in and change the constitution to get what we want robert alt president of the buckeye institute with a simple majority of 50 percent plus 1 being able to make amendments ohios constitution will become an increasingly silly document and risks exchanging the rule of law for the rule of special interests supermajority requirements ensure that people who are out of favor with the ruling class have protections from the whims of the majority buckeye firearms association a yes vote on issue 1 protects our constitution and second amendment rights from deeppocketed outofstate interests by passing issue 1 the people of all 88 counties will ensure constitutional changes are widely accepted and declare that ohios constitution is not for sale to gun grabbers like mike bloomberg and his paid minions house majority whip jim hoops r81 constitutions are meant to be stable and enduring documents providing a solid foundation for governance they must be safeguarded against hasty or impulsive changes that can lead to political turbulence a yes vote on issue 1 will not make it impossible to amend the ohio constitution but rather would require a higher level of consensus and support guaranteeing thoughtful changes reflect the broader will of the people lizzie marbach communications director for ohio right to life under the current framework wealthy outofstate interest groupslike the abortion lobbyare able to buy their way onto the ballot every election cycle and insert their political agendas into our constitution passing issue one puts a stop to that restoring trust and confidence in our states guiding document and making it no longer vulnerable to the political whims of our day molly smith a board member for protect women ohio the secret is out ohio has some of the weakest requirements in the country for passing constitutional amendments and greedy outofstate special interest groups with deep pockets know it that makes ohio a prime target for radical special interest groups like the aclu to parachute into the state and strip parents of their rights enough is enough its time to pass issue 1 and put long overdue commonsense protections in place  opposition

change the terms of ohios constitution by making it exponentially harder to get a proposal on the ballot let alone passed regardless of how worthy the proposal it is a baldfaced transfer of power from the people to the legislature once that transfer is accomplished it will be virtually impossible to reverse state rep jay edwards r94 i have a lot of issues around changing the rules in the middle of the game you know we saw during covid i had a lot of constituents that were very upset with the government and shutting down of government the government getting too powerful this is now taking a citizenled ballot initiative rights away from them i would rather have more power to the people former gov john kasich r ohio is stronger when we can all lend our voices and we all have an equal chance to participate in the work of our states democracy ive experienced that firsthand having policies backed by myself and a majority of the legislatures members overturned at the ballot box and it never occurred to me to try to limit ohioans right to do that it wouldnt have been right then and it isnt right now jen miller executive director of the league of women voters ohio i think its utterly shameful to change the rules of the game when weve had this freedom to amend the state constitution for over a century we know that some of the best policies that weve passed here in ohio have been done for and by the people through constitutional amendments sure its about abortion issues but its about so much more its also about statewide bond issues that create jobs its about the ability of everyday ohioans to pass policies when the ohio statehouse does not act in our best interest steven h steinglass dean emeritus and professor emeritus at the college of law of cleveland state university different people will view those amendments differently but the range of topics illustrates that the initiative is not a oneway ratchet designed to put any groups political preferences into the constitution what these amendments have in common however is that they all represent instances in which ohio electors determined that the general assembly was not responsive to their concerns and the initiative provided a means of amending the constitution to serve those interests  so my conclusion is that the 60 issue is not ready for prime time while some may see short term political advantage in its adoption the longterm implications for the health of ohio is at best uncertain and this uncertainty cautions strongly against any precipitous change in a policy that has remained in effect for 111 years catherine turcer executive director of common cause ohio it is inappropriate to cherrypick an election in august which is likely to have poor voter turnout for more than 100 years ohioans have had the right to come together gather enough signatures and place a proposal on the ballot citizenled ballot measures arent overused we havent had one on the ballot since 2018 its unnecessary to make the process more complicated and its disrespectful of voters collin marozzi deputy policy director for the aclu of ohio at its core issue 1 asks ohioans if we should throw out the sacred principle of one person one vote one person one vote is the cornerstone of democracy it ensures everyones vote is equal and that a simple majority rules without one person one vote we are no longer a functional democracy  rather a disturbing inversion where a small number of people decide how the majority must live by requiring 60 support for future amendments ohioans votes and voices will no longer be equal thats not hyperbole thats math if issue 1 passes future amendments will need to reach 60  and that means any future no effort only needs to hit 401 of the popular vote lee hannah professor of political science at wright state university additionally the purpose of the ohio constitution has been unfairly conflated with the us constitution the us constitution which requires supermajorities to amend is meant to be a limited document ohio and other state constitutions are more comprehensive documents that require regular change james madison wrote the powers delegated by the proposed constitution to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite  the state constitution is designed to be more comprehensive and fluid than the us constitution house minority leader allison russo d7 the overwhelming response to this from people has been outrage they see this as a power grab from a gerrymandered unaccountable legislature that wants to take away power from people and put it more firmly into politicians hands kelley robinson president of the human rights campaign voting no on issue 1 means making sure ohioans voices are heard and ohioans votes are counted if issue 1 succeeds it will be an immediate threat to lgbtq rights to abortion rights and more broadly ohioans rights to ensure that their values are reflected in how their state is governed richard a stoff cofounder and former ceo of the ohio business roundtable issue 1 is destructive because it comes at a time when there is a genuine feeling of optimism in ohio regarding our future as a competitive state capable of attracting businesses to invest here create jobs and grow our economy  issue 1 sends the wrong message to the nation will be harmful to our business climate and will make it far harder to attract and retain the 21st century talent who can choose to live and work in any state in the country former ohio supreme court chief justice maureen oconnor r it absolutely is minority rule if you get 599 of a vote that says yes 401 can say no this is the way its gonna be we can thwart the effort of the majority of ohioans that vote and thats not american former state rep michael curtin d17 over 111 years ohioans have been judicious with that power  adopting just 19 of 71 citizeninitiated amendments vital citizenled reforms have included home rule power for liquor sales the 10mill limit on unvoted property taxes home rule for counties and elimination of straightticket voting none of these reforms reached a 60 passage rate despite ohioans good judgment todays legislative supermajority  already drunk on power  seeks to amass more power by stripping voters of their most potent tool for holding lawmakers accountable former ohio attorneys general betty montgomery r jim petro r richard cordray d lee fisher d and nancy rogers constitutions are designed to endure and major changes in fundamental constitutional arrangements should not be made unless the changes are supported by a careful understanding of the policies being changed and the consequences of the proposed changes such changes should not be made without the opportunity for participation of those most intimately affected by the constitution  the people clearly that has not happened in this rush to revise our constitution lauren blauvelt vp of government affairs and public advocacy for planned parenthood advocates of ohio ultimately this is about blocking ohio voters from being able to vote on abortion access it is a direct attack on our democracy and it absolutely is supposed to be a barrier to ohioans who have spoken and want a vote on reproductive freedom sarah walker director of policy and legal advocacy for the ballot initiative strategy center the whole point of ballot initiatives is to be a tool a check and a balance on the power of the legislature in case they arent being responsive  this

citizens want to cede more power to their already powerful government do republicans realize the pendulum of political power will swing back some day especially if they continue to abuse power los angeles times editorial board but before they even get to vote on reproductive rights ohioans need to go to the polls in august to make sure issue 1 doesnt pass its only reason for being on the ballot is to make it harder for people to protect the abortion rights that lawmakers would like to take away the supreme court returned decisionmaking on abortion rights to the states but that doesnt mean making it inordinately hard for voters to protect the rights they value ohio voters need to make sure their legislators get that message on aug 8 the plain dealer editorial board issue 1 is a solution in search of a problem cooked up by statehouse insiders to defang the citizen initiative powers ohioans have had for 111 years to check a corrupt legislature it also would extend to proposed constitutional amendment ballot issues the same curse extreme gerrymandering imposes in the legislature rule by a political minority the columbus dispatch editorial board far too many ohio elected officials have forgotten there is a difference between serving ohioans and ruling us we do not need dictators in the statehouse remind them that you and your voice matter and that ohioans cannot be rolled over on their way to victory reject issue 1 the defeat of this issue is the only way to elevate ohio the toledo blade editorial board issue 1 contains provisions expressly designed to ward off citizeninitiated amendments to the constitution those provisions reveal its ill intent ohio is better than this this proposal stinks and any policies that take root in ohio because of it will be tainted by the malodorous way in which it was pushed on the voters on tuesday lets take it out to the garbage and cover the can tightly the cincinnati enquirer editorial board issue 1 wont keep bigmoney special interests and their lobbyists out of our constitution either in fact the very measure is being bankrolled by an outofstate illinois billionaire deep pockets and dark money will continue to hold sway and push their agendas at the statehouse issue 1 also wouldnt stop lawmakers from offering up a billion amendments if they wanted however issue 1 could shut out grassroots citizenled initiatives which typically have much less money and resources to work with issue 1 is the most cynical of politics and the wrong path for ohio it would blunt a tool citizens have for holding lawmakers accountable should they ignore the will of the people right now voters still have that power we urge them to use it by voting no on issue 1 poll dates sample size margin of error

lawsuit asking the ohio supreme court to request that the court issue a writ of mandamus requiring secretary of state frank larose r to remove the constitutional amendment from the ballot for august 8 2023 one person one vote argued that a special election date in august was unlawful because ohio revised code does not provide for a special election in august the legal complaint read in response to that abysmal turnout and the extraordinary burdens august elections impose on ohios election workers the general assembly voted just five months ago to abolish statewide august elections entirely  the amendments proponents in the general assembly recognized this fatal flaw in their scheme they made several attempts to amend the revised code to reauthorize august special elections on constitutional amendments but all those efforts failed leaving no legal basis for submission of the amendment to the voters in an august election in 2022 the general assembly passed house bill 458 hb 458 prohibiting statewide special elections in august hb 458 said proposed constitutional amendments may be submitted at a special election occurring on a primary election date on june 16 2023 the ohio supreme court in a 43 decision ruled that the general assembly can set a special election date for august 8 2023 as part of the joint resolution republican justices pat dewine joseph deters pat fischer and sharon kennedy composed the majoritys opinion democratic justices jennifer brunner michael donnelly and melody stewart dissented the majoritys opinion read article xvi section 1 authorizes the general assembly to prescribe a special election on a proposed constitutional amendment without requiring that it do so by statute hb 458 cannot restrain the secretary from proceeding with a special election that the general assembly has validly prescribed under the ohio constitution ruled the court justice michael donnelly in his dissenting opinion wrote contrary to what the lead opinion states article xvi section 1 does not give the general assembly the power to violate the rules that it has prescribed by law  with nothing in the plain language of the constitutional provision to support its added verbiage the lead opinion creates rather than interprets the law justice brunner also dissented writing the general assembly has specifically abolished special elections that are held on a date other than the date of a primary election the general assemblys choices are thus limited to deciding whether 1 the percentage of jurisdictions from which signatures must be collected in ohio for example signatures must be collected from at least half 44 of the states 88 counties meaning signatures are required from 50 of the counties the distribution requirement in ohio is based on counties 2 the percentage of the total number of signatures required to meet the distribution requirement in 2023 413487 signatures were required for initiated constitutional amendments in ohio that number is equal to 10 of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election the distribution requirement is 5 of the votes cast in the last gubernatorial election from 44 counties that means at least 25 of the required number of signatures must come from the 44 counties these two factors alone cannot provide a comprehensive comparison of signature distribution requirements because the various jurisdiction requirements are different counties differ in population while congressional and legislative districts are similar in population and states have different numbers of counties legislative districts and congressional districts the table below provides a comparison of the two factors described above  the percentage of jurisdictions required and the percentage of signatures required to meet the

committee continues debate on nixing august special elections by susan tebben ohio capital journal november 30 2022 a proposal to remove august primary elections in ohio is supported by a prominent conservative group and ohio secretary of state frank larose with both pointing to low voter turnout and high costs house bill 458 which passed the ohio house in 2021 seeks to get rid of august special elections except when a school district is in fiscal emergency or a special us congressional election is necessary certain local offices questions or issues can be placed on a ballot if a us house of representatives special election is required according to the bill on tuesday at the senate local government and elections committee the buckeye institute put its support behind the bill saying restricting the august special election would save taxpayers money and get rid of an event that historically has low turnout greg lawson research fellow for the institute cited costs of the august 2022 election which required another 20 million from the general assembly to take place part of the reason the august primary became complicated was due to gridlock on the states redistricting plans which went through five legislative map revisions and two congressional rewrites and remain unconstitutional according to a bipartisan majority on the ohio supreme court but the election saw less than 8 voter turnout making it unreasonable for the state to continue with augusts event lawson said if ohio continues to allow a tiny fraction of voting taxpayers to pass levies while the vast majority of voters remain understandably more concerned with summers family vacations or getting the kids ready for the new school year then our democratic selfgovernment will suffer and the tail will continue to wag the dog according to lawson the states elections chief secretary of state frank larose also stands in support of the bill citing low turnout as one of his reasons as well those embarrassingly low voter turnout rates in the last two august elections are not an anomaly larose wrote in testimony to the committee far more often than not this is normal among counties that have an august special elections voters just dont turn out larose called the latesummer elections unnecessary adding that they arent good for taxpayers election officials voters or the civic health of our state notable opposition to the bill comes from education officials who wrote in 2021 as the bill passed through a house committee that getting rid of the august election undermines the ability of school districts and townships which are funded primarily through property taxes to sustain and raise critical funding we contend that the typically fewer items that appear on the august ballot serve as a key opportunity for districts to educate voters on the levy request and the needs of the district officials from the ohio school boards association the ohio association of school business officials the buckeye association of school administrators and the ohio township association wrote jointly to the committee members of the education groups wrote again to the senate committee now considering the bill arguing the measure would have negative implications for school districts when it comes to bond issues used to improve school facilities through the ohio facilities construction commission and for renewal levies while it is preferred to keep the august election to provide schools with as many opportunities to renew a levy as possible making opportunities to renew an existing levy consistent would help districts in planning they wrote in offering amendments to the bill get the morning headlines delivered to your inbox subscribe support news you trust donate ohio capital journal is part of

2023xthe ohio supreme court ruled 43 on friday to affirm the ohio general assemblys power to trigger a singleissue special election this august despite the legislatures recent legislative reform to ban almost all august specialsthe case primarily called into question whether the legislature had the constitutional authority to set special elections at will for its own constitutional amendment proposals or if it was bound to election laws already on the booksthe case was filed after republican lawmakers used a joint resolution to call for a special election on aug 8th to vote on the legislatures own proposed constitutional amendment the move came just months after state lawmakers passed house bill 458 which eliminated august special elections statewide except in cases of fiscal emergencyexploreohio ballot board sets issue 1 official language for second time after ohio supreme court mandatethe courts four republican justices found the power granted to the ohio general assembly by the ohio constitution to propose amendments and put it toward voters at either a special or a general election as the general assembly may prescribe overrides any laws passed in the ohio revised codethe may prescribe verbiage in article xvii section 1 of the constitution was a point of refraction for the courts full bench while republican justices viewed prescribe as the authority for the legislature to mandate special elections for constitutional amendments at any point democrat justices viewed it as the general assemblys ability to choose between general or special elections that had already been setthrough that interpretation the courts majority argued that the ohio constitution authorizes the general assembly to call for a special election on a constitutional amendment proposed by a joint resolution and to specify the date of the special election in that joint resolution subject only to the limitations contained in the constitutional provision itselfdemocratic justices argued that the legislature already had prescribed when the constitutional amendment proposal would go to the ballot through hb458 which does not provide legislatureinitiated amendments as a reason to bring forth an august specialin his dissent justice michael donnelly wrote that the majority opinion doesnt take the adequate steps to address what prescribed means in contextthe pertinent question the lead opinion is supposed to answer is whether a rule about special elections that the general assembly prescribed in a joint resolution can prevail over the rules about special elections that it already prescribed in a state law donnelly wroteexploreissue 1 campaign update no leader prepares local delegations yes campaign broadens coalitiondennis willard spokesperson for one person

language for constitution issuehaley bemiller the columbus dispatchthe ohio ballot board must rewrite some of the ballot language for the august issue to make it harder to amend ohios constitution the ohio supreme court ruled mondaybut a 43 majority on the court backed other language that opponents said is inaccurate and would mislead votersthe republicanleaning court ordered the board to revisit part of the title and correct an error in the measure known as issue 1 voters will decide aug 8 whether it should take 60 of the vote to amend the constitution instead of a simple majority of 50 plus onedig deeper how 60 rule would have changed ohio constitutionthe one person one vote coalition joined by three ohio voters sued over the language after the ballot board approved it despite objections from democrats the group is also challenging the legality of the august election which the state supreme court has yet to rule onthe language politicians and special interests wanted on our ballots for issue 1 was full of lies said dennis willard a spokesman for the coalition were glad the ohio supreme court saw through the deception and ordered changessecretary of state frank laroses office scheduled a ballot board meeting for tuesday in response to the rulingour goal in approving the ballot language for issue 1 was to make it as clear and concise as possible larose spokesman rob nichols said the court has ordered us to put a more complex explanation on the ballot which we know can often lead to voter confusion but well follow the courts directivewhat did opponents want changedopponents of issue 1 criticized the approved title and said its designed to garner favor for the proposal the title currently reads elevating the standards to qualify for and to pass any constitutional amendmentthe language also doesnt mention the current voter threshold for approving amendments another point of contention for the groupin addition to the 60 threshold issue 1 would make changes to the signaturegathering process for proposed amendments starting jan 1 citizen groups would need signatures from at least 5 of voters from the last gubernatorial election in all 88 counties instead of 44the lawsuit took issue with how republicans explained that in the approved language it states that groups need signatures from 5 of eligible voters in each county instead of specifying figures from the past governors election the number of eligible voters is higher than those who voted in a given electionattorneys for larose and the ballot board members acknowledged the error in a recent court filing but argued its not a material defect requiring new languagewhat did the ohio supreme court decideohios four republican justices disagreed saying the ballot language overstates the number of signatures that would be needed to qualify an initiative petition for the ballot they ordered the ballot board to redo that part so it accurately reflects the number of required signaturesthe court also sided with the coalition over the use of the word any in the title and ordered larose to get rid of it justices said the phrase any constitutional amendment is misleading because it incorrectly suggests that the signature changes would apply to all amendments only citizeninitiated proposals require signature gatheringbut the republican justices dismissed some of the groups other concerns for example opponents argued the phrase elevating the standards is not impartial and designed to persuade voters to support issue 1 the majority also ruled that its not necessary for ballot issues to outline current lawdemocratic justices agreed that the language should be rewritten but they wanted more of the changes sought by the coalitionsome might not implausibly call this restricting or curtailing or diminishing or limiting the power of the people to amend the constitution justice michael donnelly wrote in his dissent instead respondent secretary of state frank larose styles this as elevating the standards to amend the constitution this word creates prejudice in favor of the measureread the ballot language hereballot language approved fo by

ohio chamber of commerce and several other major state business groups have endorsed the republicanbacked proposal to require that constitutional amendments receive 60 support in a statewide votethe national federation of independent businesses in ohio the ohio restaurant association and the ohio hotel  lodging association have signed on to support the measure in an aug 8 election the groups announced thursdayrepublican state lawmakers voted on wednesday to put sjr2 up for a vote while the 60 proposal would have wideranging ramifications gop lawmakers specifically fasttracked it to try to defeat an abortion rights amendment aiming for the november ballot the timing makes the campaign a proxy fight in the larger political battle over whether abortion should be legal in ohio and across the countryohio chamber of commerce ceo steve stivers a former republican congressman said his organizations board voted to endorse sjr2 because it would create additional legal hurdles for citizen groups trying to propose amendments amendment campaigns in ohio are a method through which the public can pass laws without involvement from the legislature its been a longterm goal of the chamber to make the process harder stivers saidif voters approve the measure state lawmakers can still put a proposed amendment up for a vote but citizen groups first must collect hundreds of thousands of signatures from registered ohio voters including from all 88 counties  an increase from the 44 currently required the measure also would eliminate a 10day cure period during which amendment campaigns can collect additional signatures if the first batch they collect ends up falling shortthere were folks who felt both ways on the 60 but it was the signature issues that put us over the top that made us want to support this stivers said the key for us was to avoid having these things on the ballot or we make sure theyre serious because what makes it on the ballot our members end up holding the bag for the campaigns for or against these issuesits a shame to see the ohio business community endorse a special election for special interests which is specifically designed to take power away from their customers employees and all ohioans said dennis willard a spokesperson for one person one vote the campaign to defeat the 60 amendmentread more coverage from clevelandcom and the plain dealer on sjr2in a thursday announcement the business groups also cited a pair of pending ballot issues  a potential 2024 proposal backed by labor unions to ask voters to hike the minimum wage to 15 an hour and another less organized campaign backed by antivaccine groups that would bar employers from requiring vaccines or other medical products  as a major reason for their endorsementnotably absent from the roster of business groups backing the 60 amendment is the ohio business roundtable a group thats similar to the ohio chamber but whose members tend to be larger companiesthe ohio business roundtable which is led by a different former republican congressman pat tiberi isnt taking a position on the 60 amendment said spokeswoman alexandra denneybased on the timing of this effort we believe the initiative has become entwined with social issues the ohio business roundtable does not get involved in social issues denney saidbut stivers said his organization doesnt view the 60 proposal as a social issuetheres nothing in the proposal that mentions a social issue stivers said there are people who are motivated to for or against it due to social issues but we support it for business issuesthe ohio chamber of commerce the states largest business association historically tends to help finance ballot issue campaigns in close coordination with republican state government leaders the campaigns can cost tens of millions of dollars mostly due to advertising costs the ohio chamber for instance was the key backer of the campaign in 2006 to try to defeat a proposal backed by labor unions to raise ohios hourly minimum wage from 515 to 685voters approved the minimum wage hike by a 56 to 44 margin labor unions are organizing another potential minimum wage ballot issue for 2024 which would phase in a 15 an hour minimum wage by 2025 it also would require employers to pay tipped workers the full minimum wage by 2029ohios current minimum wage is 1010 an hour although for tipped employees its 505 an hourdemocrats who are part of a coalition opposing the 60 proposal that also includes labor unions and votingrights groups panned the business groups endorsement of the measure besides referencing abortion some also criticized the chamber for opposing the looming minimumwage campaignthe ohio chambers stated top policy goals include workforce development equality of opportunity and healthcare allison russo the top democrat in the ohio house wrote on twitter yet they support a 60 threshold intended to block a womans full access to healthcare and living wages remind me again which companies contribute to their packey supporters of the 60 proposal include ohio right to life the antiabortion organization and the buckeye firearms association which lobbies for looser gun lawsstivers said the ohio chambers 66member board also voted thursday to remain neutral on the potential abortionrights ballot issue in november because he said the group doesnt get involved in social issuesstivers said the chamber hasnt yet decided how much it would spend in support of the prosjr2 campaign the measure is on a compressed timetable with early voting for the aug 8 election starting in just 60 dayswe have not committed to a dollar figure but i can say that we obviously are going to try to support the campaign to protect the constitution stivers saidandrew tobias

the only item appearing on the aug 8 ballot while it would have wideranging ramifications if passed the issue is a proxy fight over abortion since republicans set a rare august election when turnout is expected to be low to try to foil an expected abortionrights measure that could appear before voters in novemberabortionrights backers saw a series of statelevel victories last year following the overturning of roe v wade although none got more than 59 of the vote in a politically competitive stateread more coverage of state issue 1constitutional amendments are a popular way for the public to directly pass laws without the involvement of the legislature but republican lawmakers running with arguments that have been circulating around columbus for more than a decade say the process is rife for abuse by moneyed special interests and should be made more difficult issue 1 would require future amendments to get a 60 supermajority rather than the current 50 simple majorityif it passes ohio would be one of only four states to have a 60 requirement for amendmentsstate issue 1 also would make it harder for potential ballot issues to qualify for the ballot in the first place by expanding mandatory signaturegathering requirements for amendment campaigns it would be perhaps the toughest standard for ballot access of any of the 17 states where citizens can propose amendmentsvoting yes on the issue would approve the change a no vote would reject the proposalvoter registration for the aug 8 election closes monday while early voting begins on tuesdayadvocates opponents hold weekend eventson the proissue 1 side the ohio republican party and local republican parties held voting kickoff events across the state over the weekend including in columbus and medinathe key groups

people that are coming together said alex triantafilou the chairman of the ohio republican party we see our role as getting out republican voters and educating republican votersto the general public the proissue 1 campaign has been quiet having yet to air any major television or social media advertising while the campaign against it launched its first ads two weeks agobut beyond traditional political campaigning social conservative organizations are trying to tap into church networks to try to pass issue 1 aaron baer ccvs president said his organization has printed 150000 pamphlets emphasizing issue 1s connection to the abortion issue although the main campaign has steered clear of the issue viewing it as potentially divisive among republicans the group hopes it can mobilize enough conservative christian voters to cast ballots in favor of issue 1 in what many expect will be a lowparticipation electionevangelicals and catholics are a key voting bloc baer said in a text message thats where we are focusingthe antiissue 1 coalition including democrats labor unions and votingrights groups meanwhile held their own competing events in canton cleveland columbus cincinnati

canvas kickoff organized by the north shore aflcio federation of labor in clevelands kamms corners neighborhood on the west side was well attended rivaling the crowd for a similar event ahead of last years us senate racewere viewing this as carryover with what happened with the reproductive rights petition brock said referring to the 710000 signatures that abortionrights backers submitted to the state last wednesday 25000 of which brock said cuyahoga county democrats collectedwith their signatures turned in the leaders of the abortionrights campaign have said theyre turning their focus to helping defeat issue 1all of us that were focusing on the petition effort will turn toward making sure people know whats at stake with issue 1 said jeff rusnak a democratic political consultant in cleveland whos involved with the abortionrights amendment effort i think youre going to see a very big campaignwhile there is bipartisan opposition to issue 1 democrats are hoping that defeating the issue and then winning the abortionrights ballot measure in november will help them build momentum heading into next years electionstate democrats followed a similar playbook in 2011 when they successful overturned an unpopular law limiting collective bargaining rights for government employees and 2012 when they won the presidential and us senate races hereeverybody you talk to understands this is a power grab sen sherrod brown whos up for reelection next year told ohio democrats during a conference call on wednesday the only people who dont want to understand that clearly are republican and all the antiabortion crowd out therethere are a lot more of us than there are of them and if we get our people to the polls we win this overwhelmingly that will give us momentum for the november vote on protecting womens rights and it will give us momentum then for our elections next year brown saidneed to know how to register where to vote when the polls are opengoing door to dooron friday evening angie greer knocked on doors in a leafy columbus subdivision with spacious 1980sera homes greer the columbus field canvas director for ohio citizen action a leftleaning advocacy group has been knocking on doors since may convincing people at their doorstep with surprising ease to film short videos explaining their reasons for opposing issue 1although their ranks included some young families residents there described their neighborhood as skewing older and were surprised to learn that some who lived there supported abortion rightsgreer said while its not the case for everyone abortion definitely is on the minds of many people she encountersi think most people realize the motivation for issue 1 greer said so its definitely a topic of conversationtony schilling 32 said he closely followed issue 1s progression through the statehouse and its implication for the abortion ballot measure in november its especially concerning to him given the recent birth of his daughter he saidschilling wearing a columbus crew hat and flanked by two black dogs agreed to film a video for ohio citizen actionits a giant government overreach in my opinion schilling said it goes against normal conservative limited government principlesin chillicothe on saturday morning a group of roughly 30 activists gathered at a park for a canvassing event organized by the ross county republican partysome in the crowd which included leaders with the local republican party righttolife groups and elected officials acknowledged the challenge of explaining what issue 1 would do since it involves a ballot initiative process that most voters arent particularly familiar withi think it will pass comfortably in ross county  but its not a single issue so it requires thoughtfulness and investigation said jeff lehner the recently elected county auditor its not something thats easily soundbiteddavid glass the chairman of the ross county republican party went door to door targeting reliable republican voters in a lower middleclass neighborhood he said had begun to swing toward the gop in recent yearshe said hes still not sure how much the elections existence is sinking in with the general publicbut he said republicans are placing a greater emphasis on early voting than normal since the august special election will mean that many voters may be on vacation republicans have to try to convince their skeptical voters who have been made wary about early voting thanks to falsehoods about widespread voting fraud from expresident donald trumpvote early is not typically a republican message  but especially since this is a summer election we want people to vote early he saidmost voters on saturday took literature from glass but didnt seem familiar with issue 1 or the august election an exception was syvilla good a 79yearold retired nursegood said her daughter also a nurse at a local prison had told her that her union was urging its members to vote against issue 1but good

communitysome of the articles accurately describe various ohio republican officials endorsements of issue 1 combined with factual errors like misdescribing the number of us states where citizens can propose state constitutional amendmentsbut the publications articles link issue 1 opposition with marginal farleft groups such as the communist party of ohio while omitting more mainstream liberal or rightleaning opponents like the ohio aflcio and the fraternal order of police that actually play a significant role in the campaign issue 1s opponents also include some republicans including former govs bob taft and john kasich and former state attorney general betty montgomerythe articles also are written to criticize issue 1 opponents for rightleaning readers like describing singer john legends previous backing for progressive social causesone of the buckeye reporters targets is katie paris director of red wine and blue a democratic advocacy group that focuses on suburban womenthe publication includes a false mission statement for red wine and blue that appears nowhere on the internet besides on the cleveland reporter a different website in the metric media networkparis said she heard about the publication from dozens of people shortly after it was was mailed including from a recipient in the columbus area who previously worked with red wine and bluethey know that we have

for the race what is for many a proxy campaign for a november vote on abortion rights numbers have been more reminiscent of a contentious spring primary than a sleepy summer electionbut both sides continue to see voter turnout as being low enough that winning remains more about mobilizing faithful voters rather than persuading the general public the campaigns have ramped up their spending on tv

to change the rules of the game to help them impose their unpopular views on the rest of the statefrom what im hearing were getting a good response on the ground were getting a good buzz our hope here

university employee said abortion is a reason why she opposes issue 1 although she said there are other reasons toothere are so many things wrapped up in this issue stein told a reporter through her closed storm door i think theyre just trying to railroad us and ram something through that well be paying for for years down the roadlets face it said michael cornelius a 65yearold commercial artist with our current general assembly which is heavily gerrymandered i would rather leave issues like abortion in the hands of the electoraterepublicans meanwhile view issue 1 as a way to not only help defeat the abortionrights amendment in november but to prevent leftleaning groups from using the ballot process to secure other policy wins like the potential minimum wage issue in 2024 or a

issue that has widespread local support but he also said hes concerned that hes seen far more antiissue 1 commercials and he hasnt been impressed with the proissue 1 ads he has seencampaigns for and against issue 1 have spent more than 20 million on ads  overwhelmingly funded by national groups on both sides  a huge amount given the elections compressed timeframe blanketing the airwaves in the races final week the no side has outspent the yes side 125 million to 97 million although both sides spent roughly equal amounts on ads the final week before the electionalthough proissue 1 ads have been funded by national antiabortion interests theyve conspicuously avoided mentioning abortion instead referencing the liberal interests backing the no campaign and arguing the state constitution is too easy to changethe no campaign meanwhile has run some ads mentioning the abortion issue that motivated republicans to schedule issue 1 for a vote but its made its main focus framing the issue as a power grab by politicians at the expense of voterswhile the campaign groups have to varying degrees tiptoed around abortion the votes implications for the national fight over abortion rights has drawn

residents work every day to make our city stronger  from activists speaking out against gun violence to mothers raising kids on their own but yet still finding time to volunteer at schoolswe need their voices to be heard and to hold elected leaders accountablethat is why all of us should be alarmed by state issue 1  a ballot proposal that would undermine the ability for citizens to stand up to the politicians when their policies are too extreme for our state or when they fail to pass legislation necessary to move ohio forwardissue 1 would require all future constitutional amendments to secure a 60 supermajority of the vote to win passage rather than the simple majority threshold that has been enshrined for more than a century in ohios constitution moreover the proposals requirement surrounding the collection of voter signatures would make qualifying a constitutional amendment for the ballot much more difficultessentially issue 1 attacks a deeply embedded tradition in ohio giving us a critical check on our elected leaders and the power to put forward critical measures to help our state become an even better place to live work and raise a familyi strongly urge ohioans to reject issue 1 when voting takes place in the aug 8 special electionthis extremely misguided proposal was rushed to the ballot to try and stop a potential amendment this november upholding reproductive rights special interest supporters of issue 1 also want to stymie emerging proposals for redistricting reform and a minimumwage increase among othersthis proposal is part of a battle across the country as progressivebacked ballot issues have gained success in recent years in red states according to reporting by clevelandcom and the plain dealerindeed a new supermajority standard would have a dramatic impact in ohio previous voterenacted amendments that are essential to ohioans would never have become law because they would have been blocked by a minority of dissenting voters these include expanding access to affordable housing building infrastructure raising the minimum wage and granting home rule authority to cities so they can govern in the best interests of their unique communitiesthere is a reason why the four living previous governors  republicans and democrats alike  reject issue 1cleveland mayor justin bibbput simply this proposal likely will allow a minority of ohioans to thwart the will of the majority eroding the fundamental principle of one person one vote and when lawmakers are reluctant to act on commonsense policies it will create a high barrier in tackling those issues through constitutional amendments  such as protecting abortion rights and addressing gun violenceissue 1 is a cynical tool that can be used by special interests and those in

another speaker at mondays event the rev dr felix burrows honorably retired of the presbyterian church added it will stop special interests from ending majority rule and it will protect our freedom to

it harder to get on the ballot theyre changing it from 44 counties and 5 from the last gubernatorial election to 88 counties that means one county could veto what everybody else wants lewis said lewis

said lewis said ohio state legislators placed issue 1 in a summer special election in order to sneak it past voters she introduced a phrase called mine plus nine all of the attendees needed to find nine people they knew and talk about the august election with them then those people could find nine people in their network to talk to i was at an event of 20 people the other night and none of them

done before in ohio to change our constitution in such a significant way in an august special election she said one attendee asked if polling places would be the same during this election the board of elections is required to send you a mailing if your polling place is going to change usually they dont finalize those until about two weeks before the election i would wait a little bit before

lean into a grassroots movement to let people know that this election is happening and its going to impact your rights tims said were traveling around the state were talking to our neighbors and were telling them hey this is an important election and we really need you to vote noroberts told dayton daily news that he believes issue 1 deals with several aspects of civil rights he characterized the issues proposals as a power grab by the republicandominated legislature and argued that raising the voter threshold to 60 dilutes the power of individual voters on constitutional amendmentswe want to make sure that whatever we vote on my vote i can cast and that vote will make a difference in the final analysis and this will not allow that to happen roberts saidunions opposed to issue 1so far union activity in the aug 8th election has at least publicly been exclusively in opposition to issue 1 many unions see the citizeninitiated amendment as a way to trump the legislature in the event that lawmakers pass policy that are unfavorable to unions their workers or the state as a wholemccoy took aim at the fact that issue 1 was up for a vote in an irregular august election months after the legislature mostly banned august special elections in a december 2022 bill in part because they yield low voter turnoutwe all should be upset mccoy told the crowd these are sneaky politicians that are trying to trick voters into giving up our rights our power and our voicescott dimauro president of the ohio educators association told dayton daily news that his organization has a vested interest in preserving the current rules on citizeninitiated constitutional amendments as a way of circumventing the legislature on issues of education should that ever be necessaryfully and daily funding our schools has been a top priority for the organization we want to make sure that every student regardless of where they live has the resources for a high quality public education dimauro said it has always been important to have the option to go directly to the people if the legislature is unable or unwilling to act on thatyes campaign claims hypocrisywhen asked for comment regarding the event yes campaign spokesperson spencer gross characterized the naacps stance against issue 1s 60 rule as hypocritical given that the organizations chapters require a 66 vote to amend their own chartersi think its interesting that the naacp requires a higher than 60 threshold to amend their own bylaws but they are opposed to a 60 threshold to amend the state constitution gross told the dayton daily news if its good enough for them and they believe that their bylaws are worth protecting at that threshold and they dont believe that that same threshold is key for the state constitution i think thats a bit hypocriticalthat sentiment has been reiterated by secretary of state frank larose an ardent supporter of issue 1 who has levied similar claims against other issue 1 opponents including the ohio democratic party the league of women voters of ohio the ohio education association the aclu of ohio and planned parenthood advocates of ohiogross said philosophically its fair to compare organizational charters with state governmentto those organizations thats the most important document that they have to govern themselves as the state we feel its equally important to have a higher threshold if were going to amend a higher threshold gross saidthe yes campaign which has had local doorknocking events orchestrated by the montgomery republican party has yet to hold an official event

yes side officially called protect our constitution doesnt boast as many organizational endorsements as the opposition but its eight endorsers include many of the groups that represent ohios business community according to campaign spokesperson spencer grossthose groups including the ohio chamber of commerce span from grassroots ohio farming advocates to to national pork special interests along with the nations leading small business advocate and the states leading restaurant and hotel associationsthe measure also found support from billionaire donor richard uihlein an illinois republican who spent over a million dollars on ohio tv ads to urge republican lawmakers to put the issue on the ballot earlier this year according to investigative watchdog documentedat the time of reporting protect our constitution declined to comment on its current tv strategy while fcc public inspection files for daytonarea tv stations show ad spots purchased by one person one vote in the dayton market

27livestock standardsduane stateler the vice president of the national pork producers council board of directors said the ohio pork councils primary concern in this fight regarded making it harder for citizeninitiated livestock standards of care to get on the ballot and passour position is we dont like to see a small majority of someone being able to bring an issue forward that would complicate things in the way we can individually farm that is the basis of where were at stateler a fifthgeneration pig farmer in northwest ohio told the dayton daily newsstateler along with whitney bowers the director of state policy at the ohio farm bureau cited californias proposition 12 a citizeninitiated amendment that mandated certain practices on livestock and blocked producers who didnt meet those standards from the california markettheres so many uncertainties in agriculture that the potential of ballot initiatives from guiding our practices instead of proven research we always hope to not be part of the equation bowers said groups that are partnering with agriculture to develop and implement best practices to support food production in ohio are generally not the same groups that seek ballot initiatives to mandate very specific practicesohios most recent amendment regarding livestock standards was 2009s legislatureinitiated vote to create the ohio livestock care standards board which passed with 638 of the vote lawmakers put it on the ballot to preempt a more extensive measure sought by the humane society of the united statesrighttoworkthe ohio fraternal order of police came out in opposition to issue 1 because the union wants to reserve its ability to bring an amendment to the ballot if the legislature were to ever chip away collective bargaining power or pass righttowork laws that would weaken police unions positionwe dont get involved in issues that dont relate to law enforcement all the rhetoric thats been out there about why this amendment is coming up now were not interested in that our members are on both sides of pretty much every fence and were only concerned about the things that affect us said gary wolske president of the ohio fopwolske referenced the 2011 fight over limiting collective bargaining rights for public workersits a whole lot easier to get 50 of something than it is to get 60 of something if this comes up again its huge for us wolske saidthe ohio fop was joined in its opposition to issue 1 by the ohio association of professional firefighters the states leading firefighter unionthe associated builders and contractors a national trade group which represents a majority of the largest contractors across the state supports issue 1we dont have anything directly to gain or lose with issue 1 we are in favor of issue 1 because we believe that the state of ohio is one of the states in the nation where its far too easy for a special interest group to bypass the traditional legislative process to negotiate and work with the legislature to form laws said john morris ceo of the associations ohio valley branchmorris said lawmakers often do nothing on controversial topics like righttowork because of the lingering threat of a citizeninitiated amendment which could moreorless act as a referendum on any law passed in the legislature he hopes a passed issue 1 would eliminate that excusewe believe this is going to empower our legislators to act better to do what we elected them to do because many of them sit back and do nothing and they sit back under the auspices of well if we passed it it would just get overturned or we think you should just do this on the ballot instead of legislatively morris said it allows an elected official to essentially get a pass take a target off their back and avoid any

and state rep jim hoops distributed to columbus lobbyists ahead of a may 31 briefing in downtown columbussubscribers can gift articles to anyoneby editorial board clevelandcom and the plain dealerthere are many many things wrong with how the gop supermajority in the ohio legislature is trying to ram through a hugely consequential constitutional amendment during a likely lowturnout august vote  an election costing 20 million to holdour editorial board has already noted three strikes against whats now titled issue 1 on the aug 8 ballot it upends more than a century of precedent on when to hold votes on major constitutional amendments the ballot language is misleading and inaccurate and the legality of the aug 8 election itself is questionable at bestnow add a deceptive marketing campaign for issue 1 as outlined at a recent highlevel gop lobbying meeting details of which clevelandcom reporter andrew j tobias confirmed with two participantswhat happened at the closeddoor may 31 meeting at the columbus athletic club attended by about 50 highrolling lobbyists and called by ohio senate president matt huffman reveals a strategy of misdirection not truththe two attendees described to tobias how issue 1 backers plan to use a 6 million tv ad campaign to pretend the gops attempt to make the ohio constitution exponentially more difficult to amend is to counter supposed outofstate influence  when its really to defeat a reproductive rights ballot issue in novemberbut the subterfuge is even deeper given the double standards issue 1 backers also plan to use to ensure that antiabortion voters and gunrights supporters turn out to vote aug 8 without saying abortions or guns in proissue 1 ads the solution let antiabortion and gunrights groups handle the special promotions needed to get these voters to the pollsthe irony is rich since the only reason these groups would be energized to vote yes on issue 1 is because they see that citizen anger over the ohio legislatures efforts to criminalize reproductive health care has already led to a citizeninitiated abortionrights amendment and they fear that the legislatures slavering support of guns means the same may happen with gun reformits a useful reminder of what citizens are being asked to give up through issue 1  the rights theyve had since 1912 to use citizeninitiated amendments that need only get a majority of voters support to rein in statehouse corruption and paytoplaywhich is also why backers of issue 1 in the may 31 meeting reportedly urged proponents not to lean in on the 60 voting threshold the issue would requireyou dont say abortion you dont say 60 you dont bring up social issues that divide even republicans the focus will be on protecting the constitution from special interests said one person with knowledge of the event describing the presentation tobias reportedbackers of issue 1 count on their ability to raise big money fast there are now just 65 days until aug 8but to be forewarned is to be forearmed as they say ohio voters who oppose this travesty should do everything they can to counter the deceit and manipulation by exercising their constitutional right as citizens to votethere will be only one issue on the aug 8 ballot  state issue 1 every ohio voter will have the right to vote on this issue either in person on aug 8 at their assigned polling places or early inperson at their local county board of elections or absentee by mail or by dropping off their votebymail ballot at their local vote boards ballot drop boxthe deadline to register to vote in
