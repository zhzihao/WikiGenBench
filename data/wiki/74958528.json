{"id": 74958528, "key": "Tropical Storm Harold", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical%20Storm%20Harold", "text": "Tropical Storm Harold was a moderate tropical storm that made landfall in South Texas in August 2023. The ninth named storm of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season, Harold developed from a tropical wave that entered the Gulf of Mexico on August 20, after passing through the Bahamas and Straits of Florida. The system steadily organized over the following days, over record-warm sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf, as it progressed westward. Although the disturbance had not become organized enough to become a tropical cyclone yet, due to the threat it posed to southern Texas, the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine on August 21. The disturbance organized into a tropical depression six hours later, before strengthening into a tropical storm the following morning and receiving the name Harold. Harold continued to strengthen as it moved quickly westward, and the cyclone made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, around 15:00 UTC on August 22, as a  tropical storm. Harold quickly weakened as it moved inland over southern Texas and dissipated on August 23.\n\nHarold led to severe wind gusts and significant rainfall as it struck Texas. Corpus Christi reported  of rain from Harold, including a daily record of  on August 22; similarly significant rainfall was reported in northern Mexico, peaking at  in Piedras Negras in the state of Coahuila.  A modest storm surge of up to  was reported at San Luis Pass. Wind gusts of up to  affected the area, and over 35,000 electricity customers lost power during the storm. One school district in Texas had to shut down for several days following the storm due to the damage Harold inflicted on its classrooms.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nAn area of disturbed weather developed to the north of Hispaniola on August 17. The disturbance progressed westward, passing through The Bahamas and southern Florida over the following days, entering the Gulf of Mexico the morning of August 20. The developing system became better organized as it crossed the Gulf, but lacked sufficient organization to be deemed a tropical cyclone by late on August 21. Despite this, due to the National Hurricane Center's (NHC) expectation that the system would strengthen into a tropical storm and strike the Texas coast the next day, advisories were initiated on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Nine at 15:00 UTC on August 21.\n\nAbout six hours after being designated a potential tropical cyclone, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) discovered that the system had acquired a closed, well-defined center of circulation; it thus met the criteria of a tropical cyclone and was designated the ninth tropical depression of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season at 21:00 UTC that day. The newly formed cyclone continued to become better organized as it moved westward toward the Texas coast, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Harold at 6:00 UTC on August 22, as the broad storm's rain bands moved onshore. Shortly before landfall, Harold's center reformed to the north of its previous position, and the storm strengthened further to achieve its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of 996 millibars. Harold made landfall on Padre Island, Texas by 15:00 UTC at peak intensity. Harold weakened quickly as it moved inland, dropping back to tropical depression status about six hours later, at which time the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) issued their own advisories for the storm from the NHC. Late that day, Tropical Depression Harold crossed into northern Mexico and continued to steadily weaken. The WPC issued its final advisory on Harold at 15:00 UTC on August 23 as its surface low became increasingly ill-defined and dissipated far inland over Mexico.\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nSouthwestern United States\n\nOn August 21, upon Harold's precursor's designation as a potential tropical cyclone, a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the coast of southern Texas, from the mouth of the Rio Grande river, at the Texas-Mexico border, up to Port O'Connor, placing 1.3 million residents under the tropical storm warning, with rainfall anticipated to reach up to . A Tropical Storm Watch was issued from north of Port O’Connor to Sargent. The Texas Division of Emergency Management, the state government's emergency management division, was deployed ahead of Harold's expected landfall, and the Texas State Emergency Operations Center was activated to Level II that day, indicating \"escalated response conditions\". Several school districts in multiple communities across the southern Texas coast were closed in advance of the storm for several days. City services in Corpus Christi were to remain in place during the storm, including public works and transportation. Residents across southern Texas were advised to prepare for the potential for flash flooding and tornadoes, while additional flood watches were issued further northwest into portions of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\n\nHarold struck South Texas with strong winds and heavy rain as it moved across the region. A modest storm surge of 1.6– was reported in areas including Port Lavaca, Galveston Bay, and San Luis Pass. Sustained winds of , with stronger gusts of , were reported at Corpus Christi International Airport, as well as  of rainfall. Harold's rains were somewhat beneficial in certain areas of Southern Texas, which was in the midst of a moderate to severe drought before Harold's landfall. Harold dropped a total of  of rain in a 24-hour period in Corpus Christi, setting a new daily rainfall record for the city, surpassing the previous record set by the much more powerful Hurricane Bret in 1999. Further, Corpus Christi was originally on track for one of its driest summers on record before Harold's landfall, but following the storm the city's summer rainfall rose above the seasonal average. Total rainfall from Harold reached  in Corpus Christi and  in Portland. Although Harold's maximum sustained winds only reached , wind gusts of up to  were reported at Loyola Beach, in addition to gusts of  in Corpus Christi. Over 35,000 homes and business lost power due to Harold. No fatalities were reported from the storm.\n\nThe remnants of Tropical Storm Harold also brought rainfall to Colorado, with  of rain falling in Denver. The highest rainfall total in the state was  in Nathrop. The storm brought the first Atlantic tropical rain in the state in 15 years.\n\nMexico\nModerate rainfall and gusty winds affected portions of the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Chihuahua, Nuevo León and Coahuila, although the strongest winds and heaviest flooding remained north of the states. The heaviest rainfall from Harold in Mexico occurred in the city of Piedras Negras in Coahuila,  with over  falling in the area within a few hours. Overall damage from Harold was considered minor.\n\nSee also\n\n Weather of 2023\n Tropical cyclones in 2023\n List of Texas hurricanes (1980–present)\n Hurricane Bret (1999) – took a similar path and affected similar areas in 1999\n Hurricane Dolly (2008) – made landfall in almost the exact same location 15 years prior\n Tropical Storm Fernand (2019) – took a similar path and had a similar intensity\n Hurricane Hanna (2020) – took a similar path and affected similar areas in 2020\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The National Hurricane Center's advisory archive on Tropical Storm Harold\n\nAtlantic hurricanes in Mexico\n2023 Atlantic hurricane season\n2023 natural disasters in the United States\nAugust 2023 events in Mexico\nAugust 2023 events in the United States", "unikey": "Tropical Storm Harold", "summary": "Tropical Storm Harold was a moderate tropical storm that made landfall in South Texas in August 2023.
