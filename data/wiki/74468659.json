The warnings were repeated on many occasions up to the date of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\n\nTo some experts, the number of red lines that have been crossed reveal the inability for belligerents involved in the war to project power internationally.\n\nRussia's red lines\n\nThe mention of red lines have been in common use since the very start of the renewed conflict in Ukraine to justify the war. In February of 2022, President Vladimir Putin of the Russian Federation stated that the United States and its Western partners had crossed a red line with regard to Ukraine, which resulted in the consequence of Russia having to undertake its \"Special Military Operation\" against Ukraine due of the threat imposed from Ukraine to the very existence of the Russian Federation.\n\nCrossing a red line to the Russian Federation is often identified as being an action that damages Russian national interests. Such actions may include the imposition of sanctions, the freezing of Russian or affiliated nation funds, and the donation of military goods to its perceived adversaries or other.\n\nWhile commonly used by the Russian Federation in international politics, Russia has simultaneously used the red line phrase in shaping narratives aimed at domestic audiences.\n\nUsage of red line warnings \n\nRussia has used the phrase \"red line\" often, and because some of these lines have been crossed without major repercussions, some believe that Russia has devalued the impact of their threats, with the threats appearing more as bluffs.\n\nThere may be an actual red line that Russian and the Kremlin really have, but it is largely unclear what exactly it consists of.\n\nSome of the red line threats from Russia may in fact be bluffs solely to slow the supply of resources to Ukraine, making the West consider their options and delaying action.\n\nOthers may be used just to show an element of escalation has taken place once a line is crossed. Red lines are nearly always soft, variable and adjustable rather than hard-line positions that are immutable.\n\nIn diplomacy, both Russia and Ukraine have mentioned red lines when referring to acceptable peace terms. One such example of a diplomatic Russian red line leaves Russia keeping Crimea, and another Ukrainian red line sees all Russian forces leave territory that belonged to Ukraine on 31 December 1991. These red lines appear incompatible.\n\nTacit rules \n\nAs time has progressed in the war, a set of tacit rules has emerged which fit between current operations and red lines and affect the rule creator.\n\nExamples of such tacit rules include:\n\tNATO will defend its territory.\n\tNo NATO forces will operate inside Ukraine against Russian forces.\n\tNATO will not operate in the airspace over Ukraine, in order to avoid a direct confrontation.\nUnder these stated rules, Russia would cross a red line if they attacked a NATO country, and NATO would cross a self-imposed red line if they sent troops into Ukraine.\nThe above aim to limit an expansion of the war; however, it is not all one-sided, as other tacit rules are:\n\tUS and NATO will share intelligence and satellite imagery with Ukraine.\n\tNATO countries will provide weapons and ammunition to Ukraine.\n\tUkraine will not use NATO weapons to strike inside Russia.\n\nIdentified red lines\n\nRussian red lines\n\nWestern red lines\n\nTactics used to contravene red lines \n\nRed lines come in differing levels of severity. Some of these are bluffs, with parties to the conflict having given many red lines that were transcended without issue during the last decade. To counter red line policies, a number of tactics have been employed by the belligerents and non-belligerents alike. Such counter-measures aim to allow the crossing of red lines with significantly fewer or no consequences.\n\n Noise - The West has often employed a tactic of “noise” before a decision is seen to take place to cross a Russian red line. This noise is often employed in the form of having a public debate, frequently over a month or even longer involving numerous countries. Often times these debates involve the possibility of the first weapon being sent from, or via, a third country. Once this has occurred and a small number of arms have arrived already, the red line has effectively been diluted without a significant reaction. Because of the noise surrounding the discussions, no one event can be seen to be a significant or important enough event to be defined as the red line crossing moment.\n\n Undermining the red line - Another tactic used is the supplying of something similar to a red line weapon, such as the supply of modern tanks. For example, when France agreed to supply a number of AMX-10 RC wheeled modern “tanks”. These wheeled tanks were not exactly what Ukraine wanted or needed, and as a result it caused very little reaction from the Russian Federation while also enabling the ability to further dilute the debate of whether it was wheeled vehicles or tracked vehicles which the Russian Federation objected to, rather than the fact it was a \"modern western\" tank. Following this, Challenger 2 tanks were then promised in addition to modern Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams tanks.\n\n Similar, but not as good - With long range missiles, the Russian Federation objected to the United States of America supplying ATACMS with a range of 300 km, as the missiles could be used to attack targets in Russia. In response to this, the United Kingdom supplied its “Storm Shadow’’ cruise missiles with a range of 250 km. These weapons allowed Ukraine to strike into Russian-held territory in Eastern Ukraine, while also having enough range to hit valuable targets within the legal borders of the Russian Federation. This enables Ukraine to destroy command and logistics centres located in occupied Ukraine that had previously been moved back out of HIMARS range. The Russian Federation having a hard-line on the 300 km range found its red line diluted, and there was no tangible reaction.\n\n Drip feed - A decision to supply a large quantity of modern tanks would likely provoke an immediate reaction from the Russian Federation, however when a decision is made for a country to supply a number as small as four tanks, another country may supply seven, and a third country another four. If aid is given in this manner, Russia seems unable to show that a red line has been crossed. By drip feeding from multiple countries, no one country attracts a significant adverse reaction from what is effectively directly crossing a red line.\n\n Calling the Bluff - Belligerents have few options to retaliate in a meaningful way against other parties for a breach of a red-lines, without significantly widening the scope of the war, or resorting to a nuclear option.\n\nRed lines of non-belligerent states \nMany countries outside of the direct belligerents active in the Russo-Ukrainian war have interests within it. As a result, this has caused foreign parties such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the People's Republic of China to establish their own so-called red lines.\n\nWhen the international community refers to the crossing of  \"red lines\" it tends to be limited to the use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and the supply of other lethal weapons. Below, a small list of such red lines has been provided.\n The People's Republic of China was warned by the United States of America not to supply lethal weapons to the Russian Federation, or else it would face secondary sanctions.\n South Korea was warned by the Russian Federation that supplying weapons would cross a red-line, whereby Russia would respond by supplying weapons to North Korea.\n The European Council of the EU implicitly drew a red line when the authorities of Georgia rejected a judicial reform and EU loan package to reduce the influence of pro-Russia billionaires in the country, by offering EU membership candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova (but not Georgia) in June 2022.\n The Islamic Republic of Iran was warned that supplying missiles to the Russian Federation would cross a red-line resulting in secondary sanctions.\n China has told Russia it would cross a red-line by using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, whereby China would stop implicitly supporting Russia in the war.\n\nSee also \n\n List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War\n Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n China's final warning, a mocking term for \"red lines\" that hold no real consequences\n\nReferences\n\nRusso-Ukrainian War\nRussia–NATO relations\nRussia–United Kingdom relations\nRussia–United States relations", "unikey": "Red lines in the Russo-Ukrainian War", "summary": "The term red lines has seen use in the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and is a veiled threat of engagement that is intended to warn an opponent or observer not to interfere or undertake in an action or behaviour that would \"cross the red line.\"\n", "outlines": ["Russia's_red_lines", "Usage_of_red_line_warnings", "Identified_red_lines", "Tactics_used_to_contravene_red_lines", "Effect_of_red_lines", "Red_lines_of_non-belligerent_states", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["The mention of red lines have been in common use since the very start of the renewed conflict in Ukraine to justify the war.

The United Kingdom, apart from refusing to have British soldiers participate, have supplied most pieces of equipment and undertaken training missions that they are in a position to do, however many other countries have shown timidity and concern over the red lines, resulting in a lack of, or delay in, providing assistance to Ukraine.\nRussia appears to generally abide by the Western red lines, although certain chemical weapons deployed are pushing the boundaries,as is the treatment of civilians, especially Ukrainian children.\n", "Many countries outside of the direct belligerents active in the Russo-Ukrainian war have interests within it.

images hide caption toggle caption andre painafp via getty images andre painafp via getty images the us and other nato countries say they will ship a huge wideranging package of heavy weapons to ukraine sending a clear signal that the war with russia is expected to escalate in the months ahead this shows our longterm commitment to supporting ukraine against russias unprovoked aggression us defense secretary lloyd austin told a news conference friday in ramstein germany after some 50 countries met to discuss ukraines military needs the combined western assistance will include more than two dozens different types of hardware the key elements will give ukraine additional air defenses  to guard against russias ongoing missile strikes  and new armored vehicles  which could help the ukrainians with an future offensive against russian ground troops one thing ukraine wanted but will not be getting in large numbers is tanks ukraine invasion  explained germany signals it hasnt ruled out sending leopard tanks to ukraine britain recently announced it will send more than a dozen of its challenger 2 tanks but ukraine says it needs at least a couple hundred tanks and neither the us nor germany will send their topline models which ukraine has been pleading for when asked about tanks austin said the aim was to provide ukraine with the overall resources to carry out operations as soon as possible this is a very very capable package austin said of the weaponry headed to ukraine if employed properly it will enable them to be successful the pentagon says the main us battle tank the abrams requires significant training and maintenance and it uses jet fuel rather than the more widely available diesel fuel germany has come under growing pressure to supply ukraine with its leopard 2 tanks considered among the best in the world but germanys new defense minister boris pistorius said friday that the country was still reviewing its stockpile of tanks we cannot say today when a decision will come and what it will look like pistorius said strong western support continues ever since the russian invasion last february theres been persistent talk that western support for ukraine could falter as the war grinds on but fridays announcement indicated that support  at least when measured in military hardware  remains extremely strong this comes amid growing speculation that ukraine or russia or both are planning to launch military offensive in the near future the us package includes more than 20 separate military systems valued at 25 billion this is the 30th tranche of us military assistance since august 2021 and the only one larger was a 3 billion assortment of weapons announced just two weeks ago the us equipment includes more than 500 armored vehicles such as bradley infantry fighting vehicles stryker armored personnel carriers and mraps that are resistant to landmines all these armored vehicles could be used by ukraine in the heavy fighting currently underway the ukraines eastern donbas region or in ground offensives in other parts of the country occupied by russian forces ukraine invasion  explained what putins shakeup of top commanders could mean for the war in ukraine several other european countries also announced significant support for ukraine including a range of air defense systems and armored vehicles right now the fighting in ukraine is most intense in and around the eastern town of bakhmut which has been contested for months in addition the russians regularly unleash air strikes in an attempt to knock out ukraines energy systems in cities throughout the country many analysts predict the fighting will increase in the late winter or early spring with either or both sides launching offensives retired us army lt gen ben hodges who used to head the us army in europe and worked closely with ukraine says crimea is the most important territory for ukraine to focus on crimea itself is the decisive terrain thats the endgame the liberation of crimea as long as russia occupies crimea ukraine will never be safe or secure and never be able to rebuild its economy said hodges whos based in frankfurt germany he notes

ukraine total 1 shares 0 0 1 russia has yet to respond to any of the multiple violations of its declared red lines president putin is rational according to andrei v kozyrev former russian minister of foreign affairs his actions are from a russian perspective rational horrific but not irrational the risk of defeat will not make him less rational desperate yes irrational no a russian defeat in ukraine does not trigger a response according russias nuclear deterrence policy a western intervention in ukraine  to defend a victim of russia war of aggression  does not constitute an attack against the russian federation on the contrary it would align with the un charter and its responsible to protect doctrine using nuclear arms would trigger the response russia was been trying to avoid nuclear deterrence and the threat of mutual destruction are a part of a twosided strategy while russia is threatening to use nuclear arms it also knows that its use will trigger a military response putin does not know how the west would respond if it chose to use nuclear arms in ukraine he has however been told in no uncertain terms that a response would be forthcoming the use of nuclear arms would trigger the broader war russia has been desperately trying to avoid using nuclear arms would make russia lose its international supporters the use of nuclear arms will have a tremendous impact on global security and stability russia would use nuclear arms without prior consultation with china as a minimum china is unlikely to approve even a tactical nuclear strike russia has lost the west and cannot run the risk of losing brics as well using nuclear arms would go against russias great power objectives nations do not wage war for wars sake but in pursuance of policy in which a better state of peace is the main objective hence it is essential to conduct war with constant regard to the peace one desires a nuclear attack is in direct conflict with russias wider strategy facing huge demographic challenges russia needs ukraine and belarus to become a great power it needs ukraines defence industry its technology its agricultural industry its huge mineral resources and not least a wellfunctioning country the use of nuclear arms would therefore be extremely counterproductive a nuclear strike would go contrary to russias 10yearlong strategy to keep west disengaged nuclear blackmail is part of russias hybrid war strategy aimed at manipulating populations and decisions and policymakers installing fear the threats trigger inaction and calls for diplomatic solutions at the cost of the victim the strategy has for years tried to ensure that the west remain militarily disengaged and a victory at minimum costs russia will need western trade after the war a victory by conventional forces might over time possibly be accepted as a fait accompli by the west a nuclear attack however would render this option impossible russia lacks the military capacity to operate in an area contaminated by a nuclear detonation even if russia chose to ignore all the above the use of tactical nuclear weapons defies its purpose unless it can explore the military advantage created by its blast the russians are highly immoral but they are not stupid high time for west to call out russias nuclear bluff that said the risk is of course not zero if it was nuclear deterrence would not work the threat of mutual destruction is based on the element of uncertainty and the risk of a military response while history is full of close calls nuclear arms havent been used since ww2 for one simple reason the consequences are too horrific to seriously contemplate their use that reality has not changed despite the russian nuclear blackmail if we fail to address the russian nuclear fait accompli strategy nuclear blackmail however the risk of further escalation and future wars is high as 15 years of compliance has demonstrated unwillingness to counter the threats will only embolden russia the west needs to call the nuclear bluff to avoid future russian strategic miscalculations and future wars being asked if he would continue to move his red lines president putin argued that the special military operation itself was a response to the west crossing its red lines thats of course nonsense since the west had not crossed any of them before the fullscale invasion additionally putin has previously justified the fullscale war with the urgent need to save the citizens of donbas from genocide denazify and demilitarize ukraine putins big lie the donbas genocide and impending ukrainian attack he also alleged that russias attacks on ukraines energy sector and the hq of the defence intelligence of ukraine diu also was a response to the parties crossing the red line claiming that russia will continue to work selectively and provide selective responses despite repeated violations of its red lines however nuclear arms have not yet been employed for reasons i have already outlined while the west continues to fear threats that have been proven inconsequential for the last 20 months russia continues to launch massive and indiscriminate airstrikes missile and drone strikes and artillery assaults against up to 150 ukrainian settlements a day it is allowed to hold the worlds hungry ransom to its war it is allowed to continue its efforts to undermine europe and the transatlantic link it is high time for the west to adapt its efforts to the strategic realities the scenario where an open confrontation or a nuclear confrontation with the west serves russia does not exist it only exists in the cognitive space of western policy and decisionmakers related putins big lie the donbas genocide and impending ukrainian attack what if russia nukes ukraine military strategist lawrence freedman explains is putin mentally ill would he press the nuclear button interview with top ukrainian psychoanalyst nuclear attack threats is another stage of information terrorism by russia ukraines center for countering disinformation says i dont see putin using nuclear weapons  military strategist lawrence freedman russian nuclear strike would almost certainly draw

markets take the strain from the russiaukraine crisis russiaukraine conflict daniel casali chief investment strategist published 24 feb 2022 updated 13 jun 2022 key messages on the 24 february the russian president vladimir putin ordered a military invasion against ukraine to capture the range of plausible outcomes resulting from this we identify three scenarios  ranging from a russian pullback to separatist held areas to a largescale military occupation of the whole nation our central scenario sees a limited invasion to control a larger territory with russia responsible for around 11 of global oil exports the invasion could present a risk to supply which is already tight following low levels of investment however we expect the economic impact to be lower compared to previous oil shocks eg 1970s the eurozone is most exposed given its closer economic linkages and dependency on russia for natural gas but we do not expect the invasion to trigger a deep recession if the price of oil stays close to 100 then its direct contribution to inflation will be disinflationary over q1q3 2022 however if the price increases to 130 inflation will increase over the coming quarters historically the markets response to geopolitical events tends to be shortlived our analysis finds that on average losses resulting from geopolitical events are erased within one month ultimately the russiaukraine situation is another problem for stock markets to digest at a time when they were already starting to look vulnerable from multidecade high inflation and the removal of accommodative monetary policy but we will continue to monitor the situation carefully and will adjust our positioning accordingly should we see a shift in the fundamental outlook for now considering the balance of probabilities as longterm investors we favour maintaining current equity exposure as tensions between russia and ukraine increased in recent weeks western leaders scrambled to reach a diplomatic agreement to avoid further escalation regrettably this failed in the early hours of 24 february 2022 the russian president vladimir putin ordered an invasion of ukraine in this note we look at the potential scenarios that could unfold and what this could mean for markets russias red lines are unacceptable to the west at the heart of the dispute is natos eastward expansion since the fall of the soviet union while the west views nato as a peacekeeping organisation putin sees a meaningful threat to russian security to counter this perceived threat putin has issued three key demands to western powers marking his red lines in negotiations first he demanded that ukraine should never be allowed to join nato second the organisation should halt its eastward expansion and roll back to its position in 1997 third nato troops strike missiles and nuclear weapons should be withdrawn from russias western border although western powers are unlikely to concede to these demands it had brought them to the table for discussions but as russian troops roll into ukraine diplomacy is off the cards in the near term the resulting impact on markets will depend on how putin plays his hand and the western response geopolitical poker  what is putins next move the intentions and actions of president putin are notoriously difficult to predict indeed despite repeated warnings by the western intelligence agencies many market analysts did not expect the major military offensive that began on the 24 february at the time of writing military attacks have been launched from ukraines northern border with belarus crimea in the south and from russias eastern border this has had an immediate impact on markets with the price of crude oil jumping above 100 and the russian equity market falling sharply1 the key question is  what is vladimir putins end goal and how far will he go to achieve this to capture the broad range of plausible outcomes we identify three scenarios we dont know how long this situation will last but we do assign a high probability of this being a constant geopolitical risk through 2022 investors should therefore be prepared for tensions to ebb and flow with elevated levels of portfolio volatility as a result i clearly the assigned probabilities are subjective and the relatively low probabilities assigned to each scenario highlight the fact that the current situation is highly uncertain table 1 possible scenarios for russias next play source tilney investment management services limited as at 24 february 2022 how will the western alliance respond scenario 1 considers an outcome where russian military action remains concentrated in and around the disputed territories of eastern ukraine the west would return its focus to diplomacy and the market impact would be relatively muted given that this event is already priced in while unlikely at this stage an agreement reached in a short time frame would be positive for markets but scenarios 2 and 3 which consist of russian forces entering and controlling a far larger share of ukraine would have a far greater impact a tail risk is that vladimir putin looks to redraw the european map drawing nato into the conflict regrettably these scenarios would have devastating social and economic consequences for ukraine its economy is already suffering in the face of elevated uncertainty  significant capital flight has taken place and the yields available on ukrainian government debt have spiked the consequences for russia will depend on where putin stops new sanctions would undoubtedly hit russian businesses and the broader economy harder than in 2014 these could include banning russian firms from accessing us technology  this has proven particularly effective against chinese tech firm huawei with the firms revenues down by 30 since similar measures were applied on its activities2 boris johnson has stated that his government will target russian wealth held in ukbased shell companies in a move against putins inner circle the most severe options which could occur under scenario 2 or 3 are sanctioning russias oil and gas exports and removing its access to the swift global payments system sanctioning russias energy sector would have significant consequences for europe however countries do maintain strategic reserves to hedge against this type of risk which should limit the impact while the european economy is more exposed to russia than the us figure 1 we expect the impact on nonenergy trade to be manageable given its gradual decoupling from the russian economy since 2014 figure 2 figure 12 europe trades more with russia but exports have declined since 2014 source imf eurostat bea deutsche bank refinitiv tilney investment management services limited data as at 23 february 2022 what does this mean for monetary policy as the russian invasion progresses the central bank policy response will be crucial for markets the european central bank ecb is more exposed given europes closer economic relationship with russia particularly from an energy perspective a conflict scenario that drives energy prices and inflation significantly higher would place pressure on the ecb to maintain its accommodative stance while less exposed us markets are already pricing a less aggressive tightening cycle markets suggest the likelihood of a fed 50 bps hike in march has fallen and now expect 6 rate hikes by december 2022 rather than 73 the impact on financial markets will primarily be driven by the energy channel the 50 increase in the price of oil since may 2021 has led markets to forecast a peak in the first quarter of 2022 however with russia responsible for around 11 of global oil exports a further escalation presents a major risk to supply which is already tight following low levels of investment as we transition towards greener economies4 a shock to supply could come through western sanctions placed on russian exports or russias retaliation to sanctions this will have a direct impact on purchasing power investors risk appetite and householdbusiness confidence figure 3 below figure 3 how an oil shock could impact the global economy source tilney investment management services limited previous oil supply shocks have had hugely negative impacts on growth often tipping the global economy into recession in particular the 1973 oil shock stands out table 2 with oil prices doubling over six months leading to higher inflation and a major global recession table 2 g7 average change in four macro variables 6months after geopolitical or military events the figure below shows that the contribution of crude oil to inflation will be higher over the next two quarters if the price of oil jumps to 130 the grey line in the figure below shows the yearonyear oil price change in january 2022 hence any datapoint below this line is disinflationary relative to january this is because the price of oil increased sharply in 2021 which means that for oil to increase inflation further the price rise would have to be even stronger this year however if the price of oil stays close to 100 then its direct contribution to inflation will be disinflationary over q1q3 2022 this analysis does not account for the potential return of iran to global oil markets this analysis considers the direct impact it does not consider the secondorder effects eg the relative price increases in other sectors due the oil price change figure 4 a higher price of oil is not necessarily inflationary for the global economy source refintiv datastream tilney investment management services limited data as at 23 february 2022 figure 7 shows that czech republic latvia and hungary are most at risk from a supply shock  close to 100 of their natural gas is from russia via ukraine the west is trying to mitigate this risk by securing liquefied natural gas lng supplies from asia the overall impact on europe will clearly depend on the level of supply disruption brugel an economics think tank considers two downside scenarios for the europe gas market9 it finds that a smaller disruption to russian gas imports would push up prices but europe should be able to make it through this winter in contrast a worstcase scenario  involving extremely cold weather and major cuts to russian supply  would see euwide storage empty by the end of march 2022 this would present a major challenge for the european economy and gas demand would need to be significantly curbed figure 7 european dependence on russian gas varies across countries 2020  gas imports from russia source eurostat tilney investment management services limited data as at 23 february 2022 investors should be prepared for volatility driven by geopolitical poker but its rarely a good idea to drastically change investment strategy historically the markets response to geopolitical events tends to be shortlived only the 1970s oil shocks have had a significant longterm effect on us markets while the impacts of major events such as the wars in iraq the 911 bombings and the arab spring uprising have only been felt temporarily geopolitical risk has already eased during the pandemic table 3 on average losses resulting from geopolitical events are erased within one month source refinitiv datastream bloomberg blackrock tilney investment management services limited data as at 23 february 2022 nevertheless higher oil prices without higher economic growth can increase input costs for companies and squeeze margins they can also dampen consumer demand with people spending more on energy bills and petrol leaving them less to spend elsewhere our analysis shows that as one would expect the global energy sector has the highest correlation with oil price changes  that is energy stocks move in tandem with oil prices in contrast the utilities sector has a low correlation which suggests the sector is relatively insensitive to changes in the price of oil highlighting its defensive nature the table also shows that from a regional perspective japanese equity markets have the lowest correlation to oil thereby providing an opportunity to diversify portfolios in the event of disruption after 911 stock trading was suspended when trading resumed on the 17 sept the sp 500 eventually fell 12 from the 9 september before bottoming out on the 21 september the russian invasion took place during the 2008 financial crisis which explains the sharp contraction seen over the next 6 months table 4 the global energy and materials sectors have the highest correlation oil price changes source refinitiv datastream tilney investment management services limited data as at 23 february 2022 equities are also at risk from changes in economic policy uncertainty epu levels that result from tensions between russia and ukraine higher uncertainty can force businesses to hold back on capital spending which puts the brakes on economic growth the figure below shows that highly uncertain periods are associated with recessions in the us and europes largest economy germany while epu has not yet picked up the invasion should cause a spike in uncertainty which is likely to destabilise global equities figure 8 global equities tend to move in line with economic policy uncertainty global economic policy uncertainty scale inverted vs world equities source refinitiv

said it was still vital to keep up the momentum of support for the country be it through emotional support which people around the world can give or media coverage however he questioned how long such support could be sustainedthere is already a shift in the discussion towards energy security the cost to western publics and economies the stability of the international financial system these are all very real issues of course but from zelenskyys point of view these are all distractions from the principal problem which is the fate of his people in ukrainecrucially lesser said western partners would be more inclined to keep up their support of ukraine if they believe that ukraine can make good use of itrisks nato faceswhile ukraine has a fighting chance of defeating russia analysts said that if the converse happens president vladimir putin could be emboldened to attack natorussia wants to change the security architecture in europe and wants to recreate the empire by taking control of

issued demands to the us and nato that it wanted legal guarantees ruling out natos eastward expansion and the deployment of weapons that as putin said in early december threaten us in close vicinity to russian territoryrussia just needs to be strategically defeated lorenz said because if putin feels that he has achieved a victory by further undermining the territorial integrity of ukraine or the west forces ukraine to accept some humiliating peace conditions like the recognition of the annexation of crimea or the independence ofdonetsk and luhansk then it will only mean that in a couple of

war crimethere are concerns that russia might resort to using biological warfare against ukraine with intelligence officials fearing that russia could invent a pretext to use chemical or even nuclear

shepard smithat the start of russias invasion on feb 24 putin warned western nations that any interference in what he called russias special military operation in ukraine would be met with consequencesgreater than any you have faced in history he did not provide details on what that would entailmost analysts agree that natos current path of allowing member states to help ukraine individually while holding off on any collective measures is the right one but if russias assaults on ukraine take a darker turn such a stance could be harder to maintainnato allies are appropriately

government and the countrys citizens have demonstrated defiant resilience he saidjust how far russia would  or could  go to retaliate against any nation helping ukraine is uncertain with analysts

cnn uk defense secretary ben wallace calling the donation ukraines best chance to defend themselves against russias continued brutality confirmed the transaction on thursday after cnn exclusively reported the deal the storm shadow is a longrange cruise missile with stealth capabilities jointly developed by the uk and france which is typically launched from the air with a firing range in excess of 250km or 155 miles it is just short of the 185mile range capability of the usmade surfacetosurface army tactical missile systems or atacms that ukraine has long asked for critically the storm shadow has the range to strike deep into russianheld territory in eastern ukraine a western official told cnn that the uk has received assurances from the ukrainian government that these missiles will be used only within ukrainian sovereign territory and not inside russia uk officials have made frequent public statements identifying crimea as ukrainian sovereign territory describing it as illegally annexed the missile is a real game changer from a range perspective a senior us military official told cnn and gives kyiv a capability it has been requesting since the outset of the war as cnn has reported ukraines current maximum range on usprovided weapons is around 49 miles the deployment of the missiles comes as ukrainian forces prepare to launch a counteroffensive intended to retake kremlinheld territory in the eastern and the southern parts of the country ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said his country still needs a bit more time before it launches the counteroffensive in order to allow some more of the promised western military aid to arrive in country with we can go forward and be successful zelensky told european public service broadcasters in an interview published on thursday but wed lose a lot of people i think thats unacceptable so we need to wait we still need a bit more time he added among the supplies ukraine is still waiting for are armored vehicles  including tanks  which zelensky said were arriving in batches this is not the first time britain has gone further than the us in the weaponry it has been prepared to send to ukraine it was

country to provide ukraine with longerrange weapons and earlier this month the british government issued a procurement notice through the international fund for ukraine the notice said the uk was inviting expressions of interest for buying longrange strike rockets or missiles by may 4 and potential suppliers would be contacted after a month the notice stipulated missiles or rockets with a range 100300km land sea or air launch payload 20490kg us officials have repeatedly emphasized that they will continue supporting ukraine for as long as it takes and while tens of billions of dollars worth of equipment have been provided the embattled country has continued asking for more to defeat the russian military including longerrange missiles such as atacms however the us has been cautious over the last year in providing weapons to ukraine that could help them strike within russian territory under secretary of defense for policy colin kahl told reporters in august that it is the us assessment ukraine does not currently require atacms to service targets that are directly relevant to the current fight according to mbda missile systems the european company which manufactures the missile the storm shadow is a deep strike weapon capable of being operated day and night in all weathers that features an advanced navigation system to ensure accuracy after launch the weapon descends
