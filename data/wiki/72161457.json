Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas. The 20th annual Armed Forces Bowl, the game featured the Baylor Bears from the Big 12 Conference and the Air Force Falcons from the Mountain West Conference. The game began at 6:34 p.m. CST and was aired on ESPN. It was one of the 2022–23 bowl games concluding the 2022 FBS football season. Sponsored by aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, the game was officially known as the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl.\n\nThe game began in frigid  conditions. Baylor punted on each of their first two possessions. Air Force scored a touchdown on their first possession (though the extra point was blocked) and a field goal on their second to take an early 9–0 lead. After a missed 38-yard field goal midway through the second quarter, the Bears pulled within two points going into halftime with a touchdown of their own on a pass from Blake Shapen to Hal Presley. Air Force scored to extend their lead again at the beginning of the second half and went on to score touchdowns on two of their next three possessions, bringing the score to 30-8. Baylor, meanwhile, started the half with a punt and three consecutive turnovers on downs. However, the Bears did score again with under four minutes remaining in the game on another Shapen pass. Air Force turned the ball over on downs on each of their final two drives; Baylor's touchdown would end up being their last full drive. Air Force won the game 30–15.\n\nTeams\nBased on conference tie-ins, the game would normally feature teams from the American Athletic Conference and Conference USA, however the teams in this year's game are the Baylor Bears, from the Big 12 Conference, and the Air Force Falcons, from the Mountain West Conference. This was the fourth meeting between Baylor and Air Force; the Bears had won all three previous meetings. The teams first met in 1961, and afterwards in 1962 and 1977, with the first and last games set in Waco and the second set in Colorado Springs.\n\nBaylor\n\nThe Bears entered the game with a record of 6–6, having gone 4–5 in Big 12 conference matchups. Their appearance marked the eleventh bowl game appearance for the Bears in the last 13 seasons, with their last bowl game coming in the 2022 Sugar Bowl. This was Baylor's 27th bowl game appearance in school history, and they entered with a record of 14–12 in those games. This was their first Armed Forces Bowl appearance.\n\nThe Bears' defense came into the game as a potential weak spot, as Baylor defensive coordinator Ron Roberts was fired following the regular season; as a result, head coach Dave Aranda called the plays for Baylor on defense. Due to NFL Draft opt-outs, the Bears was also without defensive lineman Siaki Ika and defensive back Mark Milton for the game. Baylor's rushing offense was viewed as a strong point, with three running backs averaging over five yards per carry and one of those backs, Richard Reese, being named Big 12 Freshman of the Year.\n\nAir Force\n\nAir Force entered the game with a 9–3 overall record and a 5–3 record in Mountain West games. It was their 12th bowl game under head coach Troy Calhoun and their 29th bowl game in school history. The Falcons sported a 14–13–1 record in prior bowl games, and entered with a 1–4 record in their five Armed Forces Bowl appearances with losses in 2007, 2008, 2012, and 2015, and a win in 2009.\n\nThe Falcons rushing offense, at the center of its triple option offense, was viewed by analysts as its strong point, with quarterback Haaziq Daniels and running back John Lee Eldridge III having shown their effectiveness on the ground during the season. The Falcons' defense averaged 8.5 points per game allowed over their last six regular season contests, and entered the game ranked in the top 25 nationally in sack rate.\n\nGame summary\n\nThe Armed Forces Bowl was televised by ESPN, with a commentary team of Brian Custer, Dustin Fox, and Lauren Sisler. The game's officiating crew, representing the Mid-American Conference, was led by referee Jeremy Valentine and umpire Willian Steinke. The game was played at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas. The weather at kickoff was clear with a temperature of  and  winds that produced a wind chill of . The low temperature nearly broke the record to make it the coldest bowl game, but ended up missing that mark by 1 °F (0.56 °C), though it did set a new record for the coldest kickoff temperature in Baylor program history.\n\nFirst half\nThe game began at 6:34 p.m. CST with the opening kickoff by Air Force's Matthew Dapore returned to the Baylor 21-yard-line by Monaray Baldwin. Baylor began slowly on offense, with a three-and-out and a punt on 4th & 9 after gaining only 1 yard on their first drive. Air Force did not suffer the same result: a 12-yard pass from Haaziq Daniels to David Cormier earned them a first down and they converted 4th & 5 several plays later with another Daniels-to-Cormier pass for 8 yards. Two rushes by Brad Roberts and a carry by Daniels earned them another first down, and they advanced inside the 10-yard-line on the next play. On the drive's fifteenth play, Roberts rushed for a 2-yard touchdown to open the scoring, though Dapore's extra point attempt was blocked, keeping the score 6–0 Air Force. Baldwin returned the ensuing kickoff to the Baylor 27-yard-line. A false start set Baylor back five yards before their first play, though Craig Williams rushed for 10 yards to earn the lost yardage back. A pair of rushes totaling 3 yards set up 4th & 2 for Baylor, and they had to punt again, this time for 23 yards. Air Force started back at their own 42-yard-line, and a 34-yard rush by John Lee Eldridge III put the Falcons near the red zone quickly. Roberts rushed twice, each for 2 yards, before Daniels threw an incomplete pass, prompting a field goal attempt by Dapore which was successful from 37 yards. A kickoff return by Baylor to their 22-yard-line and a Bears first down on a 13-yard pass from Blake Shapen to Gavin Holmes set up a 1-yard rush on 1st & 10 for Qualan Jones, which ended the first quarter.\n\nA 6-yard pass from Shapen to Kelsey Johnson left two yards to go on fourth down for Baylor early in the second quarter, and they converted with a 4-yard Williams rush. Their next three plays gained only 1 yard and Isaac Power was brought on to punt for the third time; this was his best punt, going 50 yards and being downed at the Air Force 7-yard-line. The Falcons gained 11 yards right away with a rush by Daniels but stalled from there, as Eldridge picked up 2 yards on their next play but a rush for no gain and an incomplete pass brought up 4th & 8. Carson Bay punted for the Falcons for the first time, and Baylor took over possession at the 50-yard-line. A 31-yard pass from Shapen to Josh Cameron on their first play took them inside the red zone immediately, though a lack of yardage on first and second down brought up third-and-long, and the pass to Holmes went for no gain. Baylor unsuccessfully attempted a 38-yard field goal on 4th & 11 with the kick drifting wide left, giving Air Force the ball back at their own 20-yard-line. Two DeAndre Hughes rushes for 7 and 4 yards moved the chains for Air Force in their first three plays with the ball. Daniels carried for 9 yards on their next two plays, setting up Roberts to gain 3 yards and another first down. The Falcons faced 4th & 1 four plays later, and Daniels's rush was stopped for a loss of five yards, forcing a turnover on downs and giving Baylor the ball at the Air Force 47-yard-line. A holding penalty set Baylor back from the start and they faced 4th & 2 early on in their drive. On the play, Jones rushed for 5 yards to move the chains with 18 seconds remaining, and Shapen followed that up with an 11-yard pass to Cameron. A pass intended for Hal Presley was incomplete but drew a pass interference penalty, putting the ball on the 8-yard-line, and Shapen passed to Presley on the next play for Baylor's first score. With six seconds left, Air Force opted to kneel and end the half leading by two points.\n\nSecond half\n\nAir Force started the second half with the ball as they returned the kickoff to their own 17-yard-line. A gain of 15 yards on third-and-long by Daniels preempted a 68-yard pass from Daniels to Amari Terry, putting Air Force on the Baylor 2-yard-line and setting them up for a 2-yard rushing touchdown on their next play to increase their lead to nine points along with Dapore's extra point. Baylor started slower on offense, with a pair of Richard Reese carries gaining four yards apiece and an incomplete pass bringing up 4th & 2. A rush by Williams to the Baylor 35-yard-line reached the line to gain and gave Baylor a first down, but the Bears offense stalled from there and Baylor had to punt, which gave Air Force possession at their own 27-yard-line. The Falcons quickly went three-and-out, with a rush by Hughes and two rushes by Eldridge gaining six yards in total and resulting in a punt, though the kick only went 11 yards and bounced out-of-bounds at the Air Force 44-yard-line. Baylor was unable to capitalize on the good field position as they too went three-and-out, though they lost possession with a failed fourth down conversion rather than a punt; Shapen rushed for 2 yards on 4th & 4, giving the ball back to Air Force. The Falcons rushed for 12 yards on the second play of their next drive, and a trio of rushes by Eldridge for 20, 3, and 9 yards moved them inside the red zone. On the next play, Daniels passed to Caleb Rillos for a 15-yard touchdown, giving Air Force a sixteen-point lead. Baylor went three-and-out again on their next drive, with Jones gaining their only yardage on a 3-yard carry on third down. A sack by Vince Sanford for a loss of 7 yards on fourth down gave the ball back to Air Force at the Baylor 42-yard-line with 44 seconds left, and Roberts rushed for gains of 7 and 5 yards to put an end to the quarter.\n\nAir Force started the fourth quarter with the ball on the Baylor 30-yard-line and ran the ball three consecutive times with Roberts, gaining 21 yards in total. An offside penalty on Baylor moved the ball to the 4-yard-line and the second of two more rushes by Roberts reached the end zone for a touchdown. After his extra point, Dapore kicked off and Ben Sims returned the kick to the Baylor 21-yard-line. A 20-yard pass from Shapen to Holmes started the drive for the Bears, but an incomplete pass and two 3-yard rushes on the following three plays set up another fourth down situation for Baylor. Shapen's pass was intended for Jones but fell incomplete and Air Force took the ball again at the Baylor 47-yard-line. Their next drive traversed 32 yards in 10 plays, all of which were rushes by Roberts; they picked up two first downs, on 3rd & 3 from the Baylor 40-yard-line and on 3rd & 2 from the 27-yard-line, but turned the ball over on downs after failing to gain a yard on fourth down. Baylor got the ball back on their own 15-yard-line and took a downfield shot right away, as Shapen connected with Jaylen Ellis for a 57-yard gain and followed it up with a 14-yard pass to Johnson. Two plays later, the Bears scored on a 14-yard Shapen-to-Holmes pass, and converted the two-point try to cut the deficit to 15 points. Noah Rauschenberg's onside kick was recovered by Air Force, who exhausted all three of Baylor's timeouts with three rushes by Brad Roberts before converting 4th & 1 with a Daniels rush for 2 yards. Three more rushes by Roberts set up another fourth-and-short with 28 seconds remaining, though Roberts was stopped short of the marker and Air Force turned the ball over on downs. Baylor took over at their own 29-yard-line and suffered a sack on their final play, after which the clock ran out and Air Force secured an Armed Forces Bowl victory, 30–15. The game ended at 8:01 p.m. after a duration of three hours and 26 minutes.\n\nScoring summary\n\nStatistics\n\nReferences\n\nArmed Forces Bowl\nArmed Forces Bowl\nArmed Forces Bowl\nArmed Forces Bowl\nAir Force Falcons football bowl games\nBaylor Bears football bowl games", "unikey": "2022 Armed Forces Bowl", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Teams", "Game_summary", "Statistics", "References"], "contents": ["Based on conference tie-ins, the game would normally feature teams from theAmerican Athletic ConferenceandConference USA, however the teams in this year's game are theBaylor Bears, from theBig 12 Conference, and theAir Force Falcons, from theMountain West Conference.

bowl is held in amon g carter stadium the home stadium of the tcu horned frogs baylors archrival in the revivalry key playersbaylor bearsrb richard reesebaylor running back richard reese was named the big 12 freshman of the year after setting a school record with 962 rushing yards and also scored 14 touchdowns against air force reese has the opportunity to add to that record and top 1000 yards on the year and i think he will need to if the bears want to finish the season with a victory air force leads the nation in total defense and this will be a tough task but i think the bears can find some success running the ball with reeses handslb dillon doylesenior dillon doyle a fullback on offense and a middle linebacker defensively became the first player in big 12 history to be named allconference at both an offensive and defensive position in 2022 he was named secondteam allbig 12 by the leagues coaches at fullback and linebacker with 78 tackles and two interceptions as a linebacker and a lead blocker in the bears running game its safe to say that doyle is as close as there is to the heart and soul of the baylor football team air force falconsrb brad robertsair force senior running back brad roberts set a school record in 2022 with 1612 rushing yards and earned mountain west player of the year honors in doing so roberts capped of 15 drives with touchdowns on the ground this season and rushed for over 100 yards in 10 of 12 games the air force offense will run through roberts and if they fail they will try and try agains trey taylordespite air force having the nations top defense only one player was named to the allmountain west team and that was junior safety trey taylor taylor was second on the team in tackles 66 and interceptions 2 in 2022 but this defensive unit isnt tops in the country because of one or two guys they are disciplined and in position across the board key storylinesbaylor bearscan baylor run the football with success against the falcons in their three losses on the year air force allowed 180 199 and 175 yards on the ground so my key for the bears on saturday get to 200 rushing yards if the bears can forcefeed richard reese in the backfield and have success they should come out on top in this game air force doesnt want to get into a shootout and if baylor can try to force their hand a bit and get off schedule it will play in the bears favorair force falconsair force leads the country in time of possession rushing offense and total defense that makes it pretty clear what they want to do in this game run the ball control the clock and keep the ball out of baylors hands if baylor cant sustain drives and keep the ball out of the falcons hands it will be tough for the bears to win this game this will be an oldfashioned threeyardsinacloudofdusttype game and air force is suited to win those games more often than notprediction baylor 24 air force 21i believe that the difference in this game will be dave arandas urge to go for it in fourthdown situations air force has gotten people into threeandout situations a lot this season but arandas squad seems to see fourth down as just another chance to keep the drive alive if baylor can convert which i think they will the bears can put up just enough points to win this game in a lowscoring grinditout effort dave aranda and the bears churn out a victory and keep the air
