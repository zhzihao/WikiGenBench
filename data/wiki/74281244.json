President Biden called his administration's plan the “most ambitious and comprehensive U.S. government-led effort to fight antisemitism in American history.”\n\nBackground\nA number of high-profile incidents targeting the Jewish community in 2022, such as rapper Kanye West's Holocaust denial and praise of Adolf Hitler, led to increased calls for public policy actions to confront rising antisemitism in the United States. On December 5, 2022, 125 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, sent a letter to President Biden calling for a whole-of-government interagency task force to confront antisemitism, led by an assistant secretary. At a U.S. Senate hearing in November, FBI Director Chris Wray and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas had previously expressed support for a national strategy to combat antisemitism.\n\nThe following day, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a roundtable on antisemitism at the White House with representatives from Jewish organizations such as the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, American Jewish Committee, National Council of Jewish Women, Anti-Defamation League, Agudath Israel of America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.\n\nThe White House subsequently announced on December 12 the formation of the Interagency Policy Committee on Antisemitism, Islamophobia, and Related Forms of Bias and Discrimination coordinated by the Domestic Policy Council and the United States National Security Council to \"address antisemitism and other forms of religious bigotry.\" The group's first task would be a national strategy to combat antisemitism.\n\nPolicies\nThe plan offers four core pillars designed to address the leading threats to Jews today. The first pillar is aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of antisemitism. This component contains an increased emphasis on Holocaust education, and President Biden requested that Congress approve his $73 million budget, which will be used to bolster the Department of Education's civics and history courses.\n\nThe plan's second pillar seeks to improve the security and safety of Jewish communities through increased security funding and promotion of better dialogue between law enforcement and Jewish community leaders. The third pillar strives to reverse the “normalization” of antisemitism, particularly on social media platforms. The administration proposes that social media companies create clear terms of service that have no tolerance for any form of hate speech targeted at Jewish people. The fourth component of the plan encourages solidarity among members of different faiths, minorities, and sexual orientations, who have all been the targets of discrimination. Over the course of the 60-page report, the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism goes into further detail about how its authors believe each of these pillars will have a positive effect on Jewish life in the United States.\n\nReception\nThe strategy was met with both praise and criticism from Jewish community leaders. Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt was pleased that the Biden administration initiative specifically addresses antisemitism from online sources and on college campuses – and that it recognizes threats from both the far left and far right. More than thirty Jewish organizations, including AIPAC, B'nai B'rith International, and the JCC Association of North America, voiced their support of the Biden administration's plan as they remarked in a joint statement: “In an era of rising antisemitism in the U.S. and around the world, we appreciate the clarity and urgency demonstrated by the White House in releasing its National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.”\n\nCriticism of the plan included “muddying the water” of a single standard to define antisemitism by not only forcefully embracing the IHRA working definition of antisemitism (widely accepted by more than 40 countries), but also “welcome[ing] and appreciate[ing] the Nexus Document and note[ing] other such efforts.” Chief operating officer of the World Jewish Restitution Organization, Mark Weitzman, referred to the ambiguity of definitions as,“divert[ing] attention away from finding the problem and into debating definitions.” Criticism of the Nexus Document includes the claim that it allows individuals to conceal antisemitism through anti-Zionist tropes without facing any consequences. More than 175 Jewish groups, including the American Jewish Committee, Jewish Federations of North America, and the World Jewish Congress, crafted a letter to members of the U.N. contending that any inclusion of antisemitic definitions other than IHRA would harm efforts to combat antisemitism. Groups like StopAntisemitism.org were particularly critical of the Biden administration's inclusion of the Nexus Document as they feel it “flies in the face of the plan’s assertion that 'If we cannot name, identify, and admit a problem, we cannot begin to solve it.” Louis D. Brandeis Center founder Kenneth L. Marcus offered a mixed assessment of the plan, remarking that “It will come as a relief to some that the strategy forcefully embraces IHRA, and yet it’s disappointing that they nevertheless acknowledge and commend Nexus. Much of the language of the document is far more consistent with IHRA than with Nexus….It’s just unfortunate that they muddle what would otherwise have been a very good discussion of definitions by praising a definition inconsistent with their approach.”  Brandeis Center President Alyza D. Lewin also offered a mixed assessment. She declared the plan “demonstrates that [the Biden administration] take[s] anti-Semitism seriously. . .that it's not just a Jewish problem, but one that needs to be addressed by the entire society” – yet Lewin also said the document was undermined by embracing Nexus: “Targeting Jews based on their connection to the state of Israel is just as antisemitic as targeting them based on their Sabbath observance. Both are components of their Jewish identity.\n\nOne other point of criticism aimed at the Biden administration's handling of antisemitism comes from a recent “dear colleague” letter published by U.S. Department of Education Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine E. Lhamon. While the letter itself aims to reinforce the importance of Executive Order 13899 signed by former President Trump which “reaffirms the long-standing principle that anti-Semitism and discrimination against Jews based on an individual’s race, color, or national origin may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” the letter is not an official announcement of a regulation aimed at protecting Jewish students like the administration has promised. Some seem skeptical of whether the White House intends to issue a major regulation at all, as one critic argues that this “dear colleague” letter “retreats from the White House’s longstanding commitment to issue regulations strengthening the civil rights protections of Jewish students.”\n\nSubsequent actions\nIn June 2023, the American Jewish Committee announced a new task force to assist the White House in the strategy's implementation.\n\nSee also\n Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism\n\nReferences\n\nOpposition to antisemitism in the United States\nPresidency of Joe Biden\n2023 in American politics", "unikey": "U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism", "summary": "\nOn May 25, 2023, the administration of US President Joe Biden unveiled The U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.

religious communities the white house says it was informed by input from more than 1000 stakeholders from all areas of society its four pillars focus on raising awareness improving security reversing normalization and building solidarity politics doug emhoff has made antisemitism his issue but says its everyones job to fight it president biden called the plan the most ambitious and comprehensive us governmentled effort to fight antisemitism in american history at a virtual launch event on thursday it sends a clear and forceful message biden said in america evil will not win hate will not prevail the venom and violence of antisemitism will not be the story of our time this is the administrations latest in a series of efforts to combat antisemitism as reported incidents continue to shatter records the antidefamation league adl tracked 3697 incidents of harassment vandalism and assault in 2022 according to a report released in march thats a 36 jump from the previous year and the third time in five years that the tally has been the highest number ever recorded national antisemitic incidents are at an alltime high the adl reports american jews account for 24 of the us population but are the victims of 63 of reported religiously motivated hate crimes according to the federal bureau of investigation and while antisemitism most directly affects the jewish community the biden administration stresses that it poses a threat to society as a whole antisemitic conspiracy theories fuel other forms of hatred discrimination and bias  including discrimination against other religious minorities racism sexism and antilgbtqi hate said the white house release antisemitism seeks to divide americans from one another erodes trust in government and nongovernmental institutions and undermines our democracy administration officials at thursdays launch stressed the urgency and historical significance of the 60page strategy which they encouraged people to read online for themselves they pledged to carry out its implementation but emphasized that federal action alone is not enough national new fbi data show reported hate crimes in the us jumped in 2021 the administration also announced a slew of commitments by outside organizations and institutions  from professional sports teams to religious groups to the recording academy  and is calling on other groups to roll out initiatives of their own antisemitism is a threat to jewish communities and all americans and it can only be combated with united efforts said second gentleman doug emhoff its on all of us to put an end to the visceral hate that we are seeing across our nation there are four main pillars of the plan the strategys main objectives are increasing awareness and understanding of both antisemitism and jewish american heritage improving safety and security for jewish communities reversing the normalization of antisemitism and building coalitions across communities to fight hate religion how to address antisemitic rhetoric when you encounter it in sum emhoff said this plan will save lives officials at thursdays event highlighted some of the issues and action items from each category the adl found that 85 of americans believe at least one antisemitic trope while a 2020 study showed that more than 3 in 5 millennials and gen z didnt know that six million jews were killed in the holocaust said domestic policy adviser susan rice as part of an effort to raise awareness the us holocaust memorial museum will launch the firstever usbased holocaust education research center in 2024 while the national endowment for the humanities will expand investment in k12 education on jewish history religion how antisemitic rhetoric is impacting jewish communities and what to do about it and federal agencies will commit to incorporating information about antisemitic bias and workplace religious accommodations into their training programs and educating their networks about the contributions of jewish americans for instance rice said the department of veterans affairs will develop programs highlighting the service of jewish veterans when it comes to improving security the departments of justice and homeland security will meet with jewish communities to ensure theyre using all the available federal training and resources continue to help with communitybased prevention efforts and increase intelligencesharing with state and local partners said white house homeland security adviser elizabeth sherwoodrandall she said the third pillar recognizes the hard reality that antisemitism is becoming mainstream and acts of violence against jews are becoming normalized national we cant live in fear texas rabbi held hostage says hed give a stranger tea again the strategy acknowledges the role that social media plays and calls on tech companies to do things like meet with jewish groups to better understand how antisemitism manifests on their platforms and establish a zerotolerance policy for hate speech and sherwoodrandall said the departments of education housing and urban development and agriculture issued letters reminding schools housing programs and feeding programs about their obligations to addressing discrimination countering discrimination and hatefueled violence against any race religion ethnicity or gender is not a democratic issue or a republican issue she said at one point its an american issue jewish groups appear optimistic jewish groups lauded the strategy for the commitment it signifies the actions it outlines and even its specific wording its particularly notable that this approach recognizes that antisemitism is not about politics  its about principles adl ceo jonathan greenblatt said in a statement we are pleased that this strategy comprehensively addresses hate and antisemitism on campus online and from extremists on both the farright and the farleft notably there had been some contention among jewish leaders about what definition of antisemitism the document would use a key contention was whether the strategy would adopt international holocaust remembrance alliances ihra working definition of antisemitism which is widely accepted by municipalities state and federal governments around the world but some on the left who argue it doesnt leave enough room for critiques of israel since its examples include forms of antizionism  such as calling israel a racist endeavor or applying double standards when criticizing it the white house acknowledges in the document that there are several definitions of antisemitism and that the us has embraced the ihras it says it also welcomes and appreciates one prominent alternative the nexus document and notes other such efforts several jewish organizations issued statements celebrating the strategy describing their role in its development and committing to its implementation the unprecedented spike in antisemitism has caused significant pain and alarm in our communities and we look forward to working with congress the administration and civil society groups to enhance security and fight back against all forms of hate and make our country a safer place said jewish federations of north america chair julie platt others in politics weighed in too rep jerry nadler dny the most senior jewish member of congress said in a statement that while the strategys release marks a historic milestone the work is far from over the administration has made antisemitism a priority the biden administration has taken steps to combat antisemitism and other forms of hate including creating the interagency task force charged with creating this particular strategy back in december in recent years the administration secured the largestever increase for the physical security of nonprofits including synagogues and jewish community centers biden signed a 2021 law that helps state and local law enforcement better respond to hate crimes and hosted a white house summit focused on preventing hatefueled violence in the fall of 2022 politics second gentleman emhoff visits auschwitz part of a push against antisemitism and he nominated holocaust expert deborah lipstadt to be the countrys first ambassadorlevel special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism around the world the senate confirmed her in 2022 lipstadt hailed the plan on thursday as a historic moment in the fight against the worlds oldest hatred we come together to release a plan for combating jew hatred in a place where just over four decades ago a form of jew hatred took shape as official policy as state department officials erected socalled paper walls around this country to prevent jews from entering our borders she said referring to the white house building that used to house the state and war departments the biden administration has also focused a new spotlight on jewish culture last year the white house hosted its firstever high holiday reception and added a menorah to its permanent collection  the first time a jewish artifact was added to the white house archives religion as the bidens mark hanukkah the white house gets its own menorah for the first time

can in your communities your schools your dorms your houses of worship and your workplaces to counter antisemitismsherwoodrandall said she approaches the plan apolitically and agnostically reflecting that her father faced antisemitism throughout his life the hard reality is antisemitism is becoming mainstream she said this is evident on social mediashe said the plan calls on tech companies to establish a zero tolerance policy for hate speechsherwood randall pledged increased funds to physical security of synagogues adding that the departments of homeland security and justice will meet with jewish communities and provide technology to steer individuals away from radicalizationlipstadt called the launch a historic moment in the modern fight against whats known as the fight against the worlds oldest hatredwhere antisemitism persists democracy suffers she saidlipstadt referenced a rabbinic teaching saying that you are not obligated to finish the task but neither are you free to turn away from it a source who was consulted on the antisemitism strategy said that the administration originally hoped to launch the strategy which in the works since december at the jewish american heritage month event last week at the white house but it was delayed because of concerns among jewish community leaders over how the term antisemitism would be definedthe plan was expected to embrace a working definition of antisemitism advanced in recent years by the international holocaust remembrance alliance whose examples of antisemitism include using double standards when criticizing israel and calling it a racist endeavorbut there have been tussles on social media over efforts first reported by jewish insider for the plan to also mention an alternative definition of antisemitism that definition written by a group of academics and called the nexus document has tighter standards around when antiisrael speech is antisemitic it says that applying double standards to israel may not necessarily be antisemitic but to treat israel differently solely because it is a jewish state would bein days leading up to the plans launch a number of jewish organizational leaders have been reassured by white house officials that the reference to the nexus definition will not detract from the plans embrace of the ihra definitionhow did jewish leaders react to the white house antisemitism planwatchdog group stopantisemitism said the biden administrations plan falls short on all countsagainst the advice of major antisemitism advocacy organizations the plan does not use the ihra definition to delineate what counts as antisemitism instead relegating it to a brief paragraph that also includes the inferior competing nexus definition the group said this flies in the face of the plans assertion that if we cannot name identify and admit a problem we cannot begin to solve itnot using ihra as a foundational guide creates a gaping hole while the plan acknowledges that jews have been targeted because of their connection to israel it fails to name antizionism as a primary form of antisemitism stopantisemitism continued the plan also does not allow antisemitism to stand alone as it repeatedly mentions planned executive actions to fight antisemitism islamophobia and related forms of bias and discrimination fighting islamophobia and other bigotries is an excellent goal but it does not belong in this particular antisemitism strategystopantisemitism said that ihra was mentioned in a brief paragraph that also includes the inferior competing nexus definitionthe republican jewish coalition rjc said on thursday that the biden administration blew it on antisemitism policyjoe biden had a chance to take a strong stand against antisemitism and he blew it said rjc ceo matt brooksthe ihra definition of antisemitism is the definition endorsed by every mainstream jewish organization bidens own special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism has urged other countries to embrace it as an integral tool against the rising tide of jewhatred the ihra definition is indispensable because it recognizes that criticism of israel is antisemitic when it delegitimizes demonizes or applies double standards to israel brooks continuedafter initial reports that its new strategy would enshrine the ihra definition the biden administration came under heavy pressure from the antiisrael left forcing a delay in the rollout now in the waning days of jewish american heritage month the white house is attempting a lastminute straddle  undermining the ihra definition by promoting alongside it an alternative definition that says applying double standards and singling out the jewish state for criticism is not antisemiticother jewish groups applauded thursdays release saying it does embrace the ihra definition of antisemitismthe union of orthodox jewish congregations of america orthodox union  the nations largest orthodox jewish umbrella organization which provided significant input to the task force as it developed the national strategy praised the biden administrationou executive director for public policy nathan diament said we are very grateful to president biden for initiating this important effort and for the dedication and seriousness that second gentleman emhoff amb rice dr sherwoodrandal and administration staffers across the executive branch brought to bear the resulting whole of government approach is unfortunately what we need right now given the reality of rising antisemitism in the united states we look forward to reviewing the plan even more closely in the coming days and working with the administration to aggressively implement its action itemsjewish federations of north america chair julie platt expressed commended bidens efforts to combat antisemitismwe are pleased that the white house reaffirms the international holocaust remembrance alliance ihra working definition of antisemitism and maintain our commitment to its uncontested use as the state departments special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism amb deborah lipstadt has said many times the ihra definition is broadly accepted and effective in combating the oldest hatred platt saidthe unprecedented spike in antisemitism has caused significant pain and alarm in our communities and we look forward to working with congress the administration and civil society groups to enhance security and fight back against all forms of hate and make our country a safer placedianne lob chair and william daroff ceo of the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations also applauded the biden administration planwe welcome the release of the white house national strategy to counter antisemitism the first allofgovernment approach to combating antisemitism from education in rural communities to ensuring kosher food in food assistance programs and hospitals creating educational tools for labor unions and small businesses and encouraging partnerships with other faith communities to combat antisemitism the approach engages over two dozen federal agencies in this comprehensive strategy we wholeheartedly applaud the biden administrations continuing embrace of the international holocaust remembrance alliance ihra definition of antisemitism which is the most universally accepted definition of antisemitismthe conference of presidents actively engaged with the white house to shape the comprehensive federal plan to combat antisemitism the overwhelming support for the ihra definition is evident through the endorsement of over 175 jewish community organizations worldwide more than 600 rabbis representing the four jewish religious streams and dozens of our member organizations elected officials including members of congress and mayors also voiced their strong supportarsen ostrovsky ceo of the international legal forum echoed praise for the planthe international legal forum ilf applauds the white house on the release of its comprehensive national strategy on combating antisemitism and reaffirming once and for all that the international holocaust remembrance alliance ihra working definition as the sole indispensable definitionsimply put you cannot fight what you cannot define and there is only one gold standard definition ihra which is the most widely endorsed comprehensive and respected definition in the world targeting the full crossspectrum of antisemitism from the left and right which has also received consistently bipartisan support in the united states ostrovsky continuedwe also commend the white house for resisting relentless pressure by extremist and fringe antiisrael forces who sought to extricate or minimize any reference to israel in the action plan so as to create a veneer of legitimacy to masquerade their own jew hatred behind a façade of antizionism and avoid culpability for their own discriminatory and hateful actions the white house plan also contains many other positive elements including access to kosher food security grants interagency involvement and promotion of education materialultimately adopting the ihra working definition is only the first but necessary step in the legal fight against the scourge of jewhatred in all its manifestations the definition also needs to be unwaveringly implemented and applied and we look forward to working with our global partners in doing soworld jewish congress president ronald lauder said the united states now joins a growing number of european governments in releasing strategies to support jewish communitiesthe next step will be to thoroughly execute those plans and the world jewish congress will work to support the us strategy in its next phase we must have concrete action not just words he saidhowever the inclusion of a secondary definition in addition to the international holocaust remembrance alliance working definition of antisemitism is an unnecessary distraction from the real work that needs to be donethe ihra definition considered the gold standard allows policymakers worldwide to identify and respond to all forms of jewhatred including those that may be more subtle but no less insidious the jewish world has agreed on the centrality of the ihra definition and understands that it is the best weapon in the battle against antisemitism lauder continuedi know that the jewish community is personally important to president biden  and that it has been throughout his life of public service i want to thank him for bringing the delaware way to washington and for renewing his commitment to the jewish people at home and abroad now the real work beginsjewish american heritage month at the white houserecent events marking jewish american heritage month which is observed in may have made antisemitism
