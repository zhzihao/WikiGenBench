After spending her first day with the Los Angeles Field Office's Background Check Unit, she was assigned to SSA Garza's Special Investigative Unit. Her training agent is SA Carter Hope.\n Frankie Faison as Christopher \"Cutty\" Clark, Simone's father. He was wrongfully convicted when Simone was nine years old and spent eight years in prison before being exonerated.

However, he eventually reconciles with her and allows her to move back in with him.\n James Lesure as Carter Hope, a career FBI special agent assigned to SSA Garza's Special Investigative Unit.

It was also reported that the series would be introduced through a two-episode backdoor pilot in the parent series. At the time it was reported ABC was looking to expand its franchises after losing Black-ish, in an effort to compete with NBC's Chicago and Law & Order franchises as well as the FBI and NCIS franchises that air on CBS. On May 13, 2022, it was ordered to series under the title The Rookie: Feds. The Rookie creator Alex Hawley, co-created the series with Terence Paul Winter, both of whom also executive produce alongside Michelle Chapman, Bill Norcross, Corey Miller, star Niecy Nash, and The Rookie star Nathan Fillion. ABC Signature and Entertainment One serve as production companies. Entertainment One will also distribute the series internationally. On October 21, 2022, the series received a full season order, bringing up the season to a total of 22 episodes.\n\nCasting\nNiecy Nash-Betts was the first to be cast as Simone Clark, \"a tour de force and the oldest rookie at the FBI Academy.\" Kat Foster and Felix Solis were cast in March 2022 to portray Casey Fox and Matthew Garza, five- and twenty-year FBI veterans, respectively. Frankie Faison also joined the cast as Christopher \"Cutty\" Clark, Simone's father. When the series was ordered it was reported that Foster and her character Fox would not progress past the backdoor pilot. Britt Robertson joined the main cast in June 2022 to play Laura Stensen, a former member of the FBI behavioral analysis unit. Later that month, Kevin Zegers was cast as Brendon Acres, a former actor who recently joined the FBI. The following day, Deadlne reported that James Lesure was also cast as Carter Hope, a former lawyer in the Department of Justice who is now training Clark. In September 2022, it was announced that Jessica Betts, Tom Arnold, Eric Roberts, and Deniz Akdeniz had been cast in guest-starring roles. Nathan Fillion and Alyssa Diaz appeared in the series premiere as John Nolan and Angela Lopez, respectively, their characters from The Rookie.\n\nRelease\nWhen ABC announced its fall schedule for the 2022–23 television season, it was revealed that the series would air on Tuesdays at 10:00 p.m. ET leading out of Bachelor in Paradise. ABC Entertainment President Craig Erwich defended the decision not to pair The Rookie: Feds with The Rookie, by saying that they wanted to keep The Rookie in its Sunday timeslot and that they felt that Bachelor in Paradise would be a strong lead-in for a new series. Erwich also stated that in spite of not airing together, crossovers between The Rookie and The Rookie: Feds would still be possible. The series premiered on September 27, 2022.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating with an average rating of 7.7/10, based on 7 critic reviews.\n\nRatings\n\nOverall\n\nSeason 1\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2020s American crime drama television series\n2020s American police procedural television series\n2022 American television series debuts\nAmerican action television series\nAmerican Broadcasting Company original programming\nAmerican television spin-offs\nEnglish-language television shows\nTelevision series about the Federal Bureau of Investigation\nTelevision series by ABC Studios\nTelevision series by Entertainment One", "unikey": "The Rookie: Feds", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Cast_and_characters", "Episodes", "Production", "Release", "Reception", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["### Main\n### Recurring\n### Guest\n### Crossover characters from The Rookie\n", "### Backdoor pilot (2022)\nFor the backdoor pilot, \"No. overall\" and \"No. in season\" refer to the episode's place in theorder of episodes ofThe Rookie.\n### Season 1 (2022–23)\n", "### Development\nOn February 8, 2022, it was announced that ABC was in the process of developing aspin-offofThe Rookiecentered around theFBI.It was also reported that the series would be introduced through a two-episodebackdoor pilotin the parent series.At the time it was reported ABC was looking to expand its franchises after losingBlack-ish, in an effort to compete withNBC'sChicagoandLaw & Orderfranchises as well as theFBIandNCISfranchises that air onCBS.On May 13, 2022, it was ordered to series under the titleThe Rookie: Feds.The Rookiecreator Alex Hawley, co-created the series with Terence Paul Winter, both of whom alsoexecutive producealongside Michelle Chapman, Bill Norcross, Corey Miller, starNiecy Nash, andThe RookiestarNathan Fillion.ABC SignatureandEntertainment Oneserve asproduction companies.Entertainment One will also distribute the series internationally.On October 21, 2022, the series received a full season order, bringing up the season to a total of 22 episodes.On November 9, 2023, ABC canceled the series after one season.\n### Casting\nNiecy Nash-Betts was the first to be cast as Simone Clark, \"a tour de force and the oldest rookie at the FBI Academy.\"Kat FosterandFelix Soliswere cast in March 2022 to portray Casey Fox and Matthew Garza, five- and twenty-year FBI veterans, respectively.Frankie Faisonalso joined the cast as Christopher \"Cutty\" Clark, Simone's father.When the series was ordered it was reported that Foster and her character Fox would not progress past the backdoor pilot.Britt Robertsonjoined the main cast in June 2022 to play Laura Stensen, a former member of the FBI behavioral analysis unit.Later that month,Kevin Zegerswas cast as Brendon Acres, a former actor who recently joined the FBI.The following day,Deadlinereported thatJames Lesurewas also cast as Carter Hope, a former lawyer in theDepartment of Justicewho is now training Clark.In September 2022, it was announced thatJessica Betts,Tom Arnold,Eric Roberts, andDeniz Akdenizhad been cast in guest-starring roles.Nathan FillionandAlyssa Diazappeared in the series premiere as John Nolan and Angela Lopez, respectively, their characters fromThe Rookie.\n", "When ABC announced its fall schedule for the2022–23 television season, it was revealed that the series would air on Tuesdays at 10:00 p.m.ETleading out ofBachelor in Paradise.

really plays the part of an down to earth fbi agent really well this fbi team is fantastic they know how to work together this show deserves more than one season it deserves six seasons  show less show more michelle t oct 12 2023 the lead is so bad and over the top i love the rookie but the rookie feds is a dumpster fire all thanks to simone clark she breakes rules and laws just because she thinks shes right and she always gets away with it the show could be great if it didnt have simone in it so if there is a second season i hope they kill her off in the first episode show less show more thomas b aug 10 2023 everything what made seasson 3 of the mainshow so awfull concentrated in this terrible show of course the criics will love this show less show more streng g aug 02 2023 they need to change the main character urgently its painfully annoying to watch show less show more paula j jul 28 2023 awful truly awful rookie season 3 really took a dive but they luckily mostly recovered now this they really need to stop the writing is terrible the characters are annoying and boring especially the main character the plot is full of tropes and is very predictable do not waste your time on this just watch the main show instead show less show more kalie jul 18 2023 hate when characters cant do anything wrong incredibly hard watch show less show more mineth n jun 02 2023 simone is a great character and is played well by niecy nash honestly the entire cast is great together and the plots of each episode are very entertaining show less show more ryan g may 31 2023 worst show on televisionand there are some bad ones no real professional much less law enforcement has their chest hanging out theretruly repulsive her fake voice is nerve grating i triedbut couldnt take it after 3 episodes the show is boring and repulsive show less show more debbie l may 17 2023 i cant stand the main actor i find her super loud and obnoxious and i personally believe that she would be much better suited to a sitcom role than a cop show show less show more samantha s may 12 2023 having never seen the rookie i was very new to these characters and format i have always loved miss niecy she just captures your attention from the moment the camera lands on her she never fails to make me laugh the ensemble is great and i have already fallen hard for this group of agents i have not watched network primetime tv in a long time but this show has captured my attention this is a good time along with some really awesome plots im hoping hard for another season of laughs and stories
