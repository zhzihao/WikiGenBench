This Mahāyāna sutra is not to be confused with the Guhyasamāja-tantra, which also goes by the name Tathāgataguhyaka.\n\nOverview\n\nContent \nThe sutra centers around a dialogue between the Buddha and the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi. It discusses the three secrets of a Buddha's body, speech and mind, the Mahayana view of non-duality, the nature of the mind and how it relates to the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Tetsutaka Hamano's study, the sutra can be divided into three sections:\n\n Chapters 1 to 10 focus on \"the three secrets of the bodhisattvas and the three secrets of the Tathāgata.\"\n Chapters 11 to 14 focus on \"the life of the Buddha from the perspective of Vajrapāṇi.\" \n Chapters 15 to 25, \"on bodhisattva conduct and the deeds of Vajrapāṇi.\"\n\nThe nature of Buddhahood \n\nThe main teaching of the Tathāgataguhya is the Buddhas and bodhisattvas manifest in infinite ways (through their magical body, speech and mind). This Buddha activity is completely automatic, unintentional and non-conceptual. These manifestations also arise due to the karma and mental inclinations of sentient beings and they match the needs of sentient beings.\n\nAccording to a translator of the sutra, Shaku Shingan, the Tathāgataguhya sees the nature of the Buddha as being like space (Skt. ākāsa) and so it is all-pervasive and spans the cosmos. Thus the Buddha is seen as being within all beings. This means that any perception of the Buddha is just a reflection of our own minds and any knowledge of the Dharma that one can attain is only due to the Buddha wisdom which dwells in the bodies of all sentient beings. The sutra states:the superior wisdom possessed by all Tathāgatas dwells in the bodies of all sentient beings ... It would not be possible otherwise for all sentient beings abiding anywhere to accord with the secrets that the Tathāgata teaches if they did not contain the Tathāgata’s power of assistance and accord with the Tathāgata’s Dharma nature. Furthermore, if one hears, if one speaks, and if one has an understanding about the profound Dharma of the secrets taught by the Tathāgata, then that is all by virtue of the power of the Tathāgata’s assistance.Thus, according to this sutra, sentient beings do not gain knowledge of the Dharma due to their own efforts, but through the power of the Buddha. The bodhisattva path therefore is cultivated by giving rise to bodhicitta and by understanding the true nature of a Buddha's Dharma body (which is empty, all pervasive and unlimited). This activates the entirety of the purity of the Buddha's body, speech and mind that is already within all beings and this gives rise to the Buddha. Therefore, the result (Buddhahood) is not attain by creating it through causes, rather the result is merely accessed since it is already present in the aspirant. This means that the bodhisattva who has given rise to bodhicitta practices the path of the paramitas with the Buddha's power aiding them.\n\nThe Tathāgataguhya also equates the Buddha's body, which is said to span all three times (past, present, future), with suchness. The Buddha's bodily appearance to sentient beings (as the figure of Śākyamuni Buddha) is just one manifestation of this cosmic body or Dharma body (Dharmakāya) for the good of sentient beings. It always appears in accord with their needs and nature. The sutra compares this automatic Buddha activity to a mirror, which reflects whatever is in front of it effortlessly and without intending to.\n\nRegarding the Buddha's speech, the sutra states the Buddha never really spoke a word:from the day and night that he attained the fruit of anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi to the day and night that he will enter Mahāparinirvāṇa, within that period, the Tathāgata has never once uttered a single word, he has not expressed any meaning. Why? Because the Buddha Tathāgata permanently abides in samāhita [i.e., meditative equipoise].While the Buddha is said not to actually say anything, through the power of the Buddha's secret of speech, living beings hear various teachings in words that conform to their linguistic and regional needs. This is compared to a magical instrument without a player.\n\nThe secret of the Buddha's mind is the fact that it is always in a transcendent state of samādhi, it does not think, intend or fluctuate. However, it can still manifest in endless ways to help sentient beings according to their needs.\n\nOther teachings \nThe later versions of this sutra also contain various vidyās, which in this case refers to mantras. The sutra also teaches a dhāraṇī called “Dhāraṇī Door of the Entry into the Characteristics of Dharmas,” which is just the Sanskrit letter A. This letter precedes all letters in the Sanskrit syllabary and is also a negating prefix, thus it symbolizes non-duality, ineffability and emptiness. The letter is important in other Mahāyāna texts, being the main teaching of the Perfection of Wisdom in One Letter (Ekākṣarī-prajñāpāramitā).\n\nInfluence \nThe Tathāgataguhya is widely cited by Indian Buddhist authors, especially by Madhyamaka school authors like Candrakīrti, Shantideva and Kamalaśīla. According to Etienne Lamotte, the Tathāgataguhya is also cited by the Vimalakirti Sutra twice. The Tathāgataguhyaka sutra is also referenced in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra. The sutra is also cited three times in the Dà zhìdù lùn translated by Kumārajīva (4th century). According to Tetsutaka Hamano, this sutra was also an important source for the ideas of the Buddha found in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṅkāra of Sthiramati.\n\nSome scholars, like Hamano, also consider the Tathāgataguhya to be related or similar to the tathāgatagarbha sūtras, since its doctrine about the omnipresence of the Buddha and the presence of the Buddha's knowledge within sentient beings seems to prefigure the Buddha-nature ideas found in tathāgatagarbha texts (which are not mentioned in the Tathāgataguhya), including the Ratnagotravibhāga.\n\nThe Tathāgataguhya was also influential on Nepalese Newar Buddhism, where it was originally part of the Navagrantha or Navasūtra, a core set of nine Mahāyāna sutras in this tradition.\n\nTranslations \nWhile the Sanskrit text of the Tathāgataguhya exists only in fragmentary form, there is a full Tibetan translation (by Jinamitra, Dānaśila, Munivarman, and Yeshe de) and two Chinese translations, one (Taisho 310) by Dharmarakṣa of Dunhuang (230–316 CE) and one by a later Song dynasty Dharmarakṣa (died 1058) in Taisho 312. According to Shaku Shingan, the earlier Chinese translation contains various terms that are influenced by Daoist terminology.\n\nAccording to Japanese scholar Hiromitsu Ikuma, the surviving Sanskrit manuscript has numerous issues and is a later version of the text, similar to the Song dynasty version (and the Tibetan).\n\nThe sutra has been little studied by Western scholars, and most of the work done by modern scholars on it is in Japanese. An English translation from the Chinese (Taisho number 312) has been published by Shaku Shingan.\n\nReferences \n\n Mahayana\nMahayana sutras\nMahayana texts", "unikey": "Tathāgataguhya Sūtra", "summary": "The Tathāgataguhya Sūtra (Secrets of the Tathāgata) or Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśasūtra (The Sūtra that Teaches the Inconceivable Mystery of the Tathāgata) is an important Mahayana Buddhist sutra, which is also part of the Mahāratnakūṭa compilation.[1]\n", "outlines": ["Overview", "References"], "contents": ["### Content\nThe sutra centers around a dialogue between theBuddhaand thebodhisattvaVajrapāṇi.

sūtra the teaching of the mysteries and secrets of the realized ones chapter 1 on saumya thus did i hear at one time the blessed one was staying at vulture peak in rājagṛha together with a great monastic assembly of fortytwo thousand monks as well as eightyfour thousand bodhisattvas of great courage who were well known on account of their fame a great many of whom had come from other buddha domains all of them had attained the state of acceptance32 they could not be turned back they were limited to only one more life they had acquired a powerful memory and the formulas that support it they had acquired states of meditative concentration their inspired eloquence was without impediment they were adept at traveling to limitless buddha domains throughout the ten directions they had made childs play of the forms of knowledge including the supernormal faculties33 they were undefeated in argument by any and all proponents of rival doctrines they had vanquished their adversaries and māra in all his forms34 chapter 2 the secret of the bodhisattvas speech chapter 3 the secret of the bodhisattvas mind 31 once again vajrapāṇi lord of the guhyakas spoke to the bodhisattva śāntamati now śāntamati what is the secret of a bodhisattvas mind and the purity of his mental action chapter 4 the coming of resounding musical sound chapter 5 the pastlife story of dhṛtarāṣṭra chapter 6 the path of awakening chapter 7 the secret of the realized ones body 71 at that point the bodhisattva śāntamati asked vajrapāṇi lord of the guhyakas lord of the guhyakas what are the secrets of the realized ones please use your inspired eloquence to describe at least partially the secrets of the realized ones chapter 8 the teaching of the mystery and secret of the realized ones speech 81 once again vajrapāṇi lord of the guhyakas spoke to the bodhisattva of great courage śāntamati śāntamati what is the secret of the speech and the purity of the verbal action of the realized one during the period of time śāntamati from the night when the realized one awakens to unsurpassable and perfect awakening until the night when having relinquished his life force a realized one passes into complete cessation the realized one has not articulated and will not pronounce even a single syllable106 what is the cause of this it is because śāntamati a realized one is in a continuous state of meditative concentration the realized one does not breathe in or breathe out he does not begin any thought process or continue any thought process and no speech emerges from what does not begin or continue any thought process so a realized one does not begin any thought process or continue any thought process or form any idea he does not form any concept he does not speak anything he does not articulate anything he does not pronounce anything and yet beings have the thought the realized one is speaking chapter 9 the secret of the realized ones mind chapter 10 celebrating the virtues of vajrapāṇi lord of the guhyakas chapter 11 the exalted nature of the severe ascetic practices the method of acquiring food to bring beings to maturity chapter 12 the journey to the seat of awakening 122  an earth bearer unwavering and unshakeable without craving and devoid of enmity the bodhisattva is approaching that tree i will decorate the surface of the fertile ground chapter 13 the taming of the māras 131 just as soon as the bodhisattva took his seat upon the lions seat śāntamati a ray of light issued from the tuft of hair between his eyebrows this light is called challenging māra and it reached a billion māras throughout the cosmos of a billion worlds and touched each of them in their respective abodes which immediately gave them goose bumps when they realized that their abodes were being consumed by the light and made dim in comparison they thought to themselves what is the cause of this for what reason have these abodes seemingly been made dim could it not be that a bodhisattva is seated on the seat of awakening and is awakening to unsurpassable perfect awakening looking down they saw that the bodhisattva was seated at the seat of awakening chapter 14 the turning of the wheel of dharma chapter 15 the bases of cognition chapter 16 the prediction for vajrapāṇi lord of the guhyakas chapter 17 articulating nonduality chapter 18 enjoying a meal after going to aḍagavatī chapter

the blessed one rested in the afternoon and then he got up and taught the dharma then the sixty thousand inhabitants of the great city of rājagṛha including king ajātaśatru and his household came to know that the blessed one had returned so in the afternoon they took flowers incense garlands and scented oils left the great city of rājagṛha and came to the hill vulture peak and into the presence of the blessed one they bowed their heads at the blessed ones feet and sat to one side as they were sitting to one side king ajātaśatru spoke to the blessed one chapter 22 the explanation of
