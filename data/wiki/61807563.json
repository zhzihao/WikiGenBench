{"id": 61807563, "key": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly%20Hills%20Cop%3A%20Axel%20Foley", "text": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is an upcoming American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Mark Molloy, written by Will Beall, Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten, from a story by Beall, and starring Eddie Murphy. Set to be released on Netflix, it will be the fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop film series, following Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Beverly Hills Cop II (1987), and Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). \n\nThe film entered development in the mid-1990s, under Murphy's production company. Various directors and screenwriters were attached over the years, including Brett Ratner and Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. Molloy was hired to direct in April 2022, with production beginning in California that August. Production has wrapped up, with the film scheduled to be released at a later date.\n\nPremise\nAfter the death of an old friend, Detroit Police Department Lieutenant Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills to investigate corruption within the Beverly Hills Police Department with his daughter and her ex-boyfriend.\n\nCast\n Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart police lieutenant from Detroit, Michigan, who frequently traveled to Beverly Hills to investigate crimes that previously had mutual colleagues or friends of his wounded or killed.\n Judge Reinhold as Lt. William \"Billy\" Rosewood, John Taggart's former partner in the Beverly Hills Police Department.\n Paul Reiser as Det. Jeffrey Friedman, Axel's partner in the Detroit Police Department. Reiser returns to the role after 35 years from Beverly Hills Cop II.\n John Ashton as Sgt. John Taggart, Billy Rosewood's former partner in the Beverly Hills Police Department who retired from the force as of Beverly Hills Cop III. Ashton returns to the role after 35 years from Beverly Hills Cop II.\n Bronson Pinchot as Serge, a former art gallery salesman turned weapons dealer that worked for Victor Maitland. Pinchot returns to the role after 28 years from Beverly Hills Cop III.\n Taylour Paige\n Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n Kevin Bacon\n Mark Pellegrino\nPatricia Belcher as Judge Angelic\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nA fourth entry in the series was initially announced for release in the mid-1990s, under the production of Eddie Murphy's production company Eddie Murphy Productions, before production  fizzled out. The film was re-announced in 2006, when producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced his intention to resurrect the film series, though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film, passing production duties to Lorenzo di Bonaventura. In September 2006 a script, which was an amalgamation of several earlier drafts, was presented to Murphy, who was reported to be \"very happy\" with the outline, described as an attempt to recapture the \"feel of the original\". Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourth Beverly Hills Cop film was to make up for the fact that the third film was \"horrible\" and \"he didn't want to leave (the series) like that\".\n\nIn May 2008, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner was officially named director, promising the film would return under the series' standard \"R\" rating, rather than as a rumored watered down PG-13. In July 2008, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script, and completed a new script under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated, \"I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence.\" Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, and Bronson Pinchot, would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 that he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer's \"Axel F\", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying  \"It'll be back but it'll be a whole new interpretation.\" On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film, but that it wouldn't be \"anytime soon.\"\n\nIn October 2011, Murphy discussed a possible fourth film, stating, \"They're not doing it. What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.\" During late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film. On September 13, 2013, Jerry Bruckheimer stated he was again in talks to produce. On December 6, 2013, it was again announced that Eddie Murphy would reprise the role of Axel Foley and Brett Ratner would direct. Murphy was paid $15 million for his involvement. On May 2, 2014, Deadline announced that Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would be writing the screenplay.\n\nOn June 27, 2014, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type of character of Axel Foley after years of making family-friendly films. \"I haven't done a street guy, working class, a blue-collar character in ages so maybe it's like, 'Oh, wow, I didn't remember he was able to do that,'\" Murphy said. According to studio reports on the film's plot, Foley will return to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he will be faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America's most tenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state. The film will be shot in and around Detroit and is estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016 release, but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled Beverly Hills Cop IV from its release schedule, due to script concerns. On June 14, 2016, Deadline Hollywood reported that Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, directors of the Belgian drama Black, would direct the film. In September 2017, Arbi and Fallah stated their interest in casting Tom Hardy or Channing Tatum to star alongside Murphy.\n\nIn August 2019, the film was described as still being in the developmental phase. On October 1, 2019, in an interview with Collider, Murphy announced that principal photography would commence after the filming of Coming 2 America. On November 14, 2019, Deadline Hollywood announced that Paramount Pictures made a one-time license deal, with an option for a sequel, with Netflix to develop the film. In May 2020, after delays in the filmmaking business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Arbi and Fallah confirmed they were still attached as co-directors and that a new screenwriter was working on a new script for the film. In April 2022, Arbi and Fallah left the film to focus on Batgirl (prior to its cancellation), with Mark Molloy hired to replace them. In the same article, Will Beall was announced to have written the script. In March 2023, Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten were given credit for the screenplay, with Beall also receiving story credit.\n\nFilming\nIn February 2022, the film entered pre-production and received a California state tax credit of $16,059,000. Principal photography began on August 29, 2022, in San Bernardino, along with other areas in California, for 58 days, to generate $78 million in qualified spending in tax incentives. In August 2022, Taylour Paige and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were cast in undisclosed roles. In the same month, Paul Reiser and John Ashton were confirmed to reprise their roles as Det. Jeffrey Friedman and Sgt. John Taggart, respectively, from the first two films. In September, Judge Reinhold and Bronson Pinchot were confirmed to reprise their roles as Sgt. William \"Billy\" Rosewood and Serge respectively, with Kevin Bacon and Mark Pellegrino also joining the cast. Filming also occurred in Detroit in November 2022, before production wrapped in early 2023.\n\nRelease\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is set to be released by Netflix, in the United States.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nAmerican action comedy films\nAmerican buddy comedy films\nAmerican buddy cop films\nAmerican police detective films\nAmerican sequel films\n4\nEnglish-language Netflix original films\nFictional portrayals of the Detroit Police Department\nFilms about murder\nFilms postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nFilms produced by Jerry Bruckheimer\nFilms produced by Eddie Murphy\nFilms scored by Harold Faltermeyer\nFilms set in Beverly Hills, California\nFilms set in Detroit\nFilms set in Los Angeles\nFilms shot in California\nFilms with screenplays by Will Beall\nParamount Pictures films\nUpcoming directorial debut films\nUpcoming English-language films\nUpcoming Netflix original films\nUpcoming sequel films", "unikey": "Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Premise", "Cast", "Production", "Music", "Release", "Accolades", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["After the death of an old friend,Detroit Police DepartmentLieutenantAxel Foleyreturns toBeverly Hillsto investigate corruption within theBeverly Hills Police Departmentwith his estranged daughter and her ex-boyfriend.\n", "", "### Development\nA fourth entry in the series was initially announced for release in the mid-1990s, under the production ofEddie Murphy's production company Eddie Murphy Productions, before production  fizzled out.The film was re-announced in 2006, when producerJerry Bruckheimerannounced his intention to resurrect the film series, though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film, passing production duties toLorenzo di Bonaventura.\nIn September 2006 a script, which was an amalgamation of several earlier drafts, was presented to Murphy, who was reported to be \"very happy\" with the outline, described as an attempt to recapture the \"feel of the original\".Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourthBeverly Hills Copfilm was to make up for the fact that the third film was \"horrible\" and \"he didn't want to leave (the series) like that\".\nIn May 2008,Rush HourdirectorBrett Ratnerwas officially named director, promising the film would return under the series' standard \"R\" rating, rather than as a rumored watered down PG-13.In July 2008,Michael BrandtandDerek Haaswere hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script,and completed a new script under the working titleBeverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friendBilly Rosewood.\nThe script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea.

variety home film features jul 20 2022 900am pt inside movie stars salaries joaquin phoenix nabs 20m for joker 2 tom cruise heads to over 100m and more by brent lang agent ethan hunt banks on himself tom cruise is taking a lower fee upfront for starring in the next two mission impossible films which sources say leads to a meager paycheck in the 12 million to 14 million range but he commands a significant percentage of the movies firstdollar gross that means that cruise gets box office bonuses before the studio even breaks even in the case of top gun maverick still flying high at nearly 12 billion at the global box office sources estimate that cruise will net 100 million or more from ticket sales his salary and his eventual cut of home entertainment rentals and streaming revenue i would never bet against tom cruise says one studio executive noting that cruise is superhuman when it comes to crisscrossing the globe promoting his movies though he doesnt do print interviews most actors arent worth what you pay them but cruise and maybe dwayne johnson justify their salaries cruises pact is a vestige of a time when stars not superheroes were the reason that audiences flocked to movie theaters to see a new release but things have changed since marvel took the box office hostage in the early aughts putting an interchangeable array of chrises in spandex and masks the problem is that even though those actors are surefire draws any time the avengers assemble they cant always attract a crowd when they try to leverage their success in other genres that doesnt mean that movie stars need a bailout the streaming wars have been very good for their bottom lines apple will pay leonardo dicaprio 30 million to reteam with martin scorsese on the historical drama killers of the flower moon as well as shell out 30 million to brad pitt for getting behind the wheel of a currently untitled formula one drama from top gun maverick director joseph kosinski and 35 million to will smith for appearing in the escapedslave thriller emancipation not to be outdone netflix will pony up 20 million for chris hemsworth and 10 million to millie bobby brown to reprise their roles in the upcoming sequels to extraction and enola holmes studio executives concede that the payouts at netflix apple and their ilk have caused some actors to raise their quotes johnson for instance asked for and received 225 million to play the lead in black adam a dc superhero movie in addition he will receive millions more for producing the film and earns a fee on top of that to promote the movie on his social media channels but those gaudy paydays come with caveats apple has included clauses in some contracts that make bonuses contingent on films coming in on time and on budget and all of the streamers are essentially paying out the actors backends that eliminates the risk that their movies will collapse at the box office which would theoretically deprive them of all those bonuses yet it also puts a cap on their potential earnings if say killers of the flower moon is a globestraddling phenomenon in success stars reap rewards in other ways jason momoa had an option to appear in a sequel to aquaman as part of his initial deal but after the first film topped 1 billion he renegotiated his pact to essentially double his salary to carry the trident once more now momoa will pull in 15 million for his sophomore trip to atlantis the same holds true for joaquin phoenix when he first portrayed gothams most infamous villain in 2019s joker phoenix earned 45 million the film went on to earn more than 1 billion and landed the actor an oscar if warner bros is going to get phoenix back in clown makeup it will cost the studio 20 million the good times may not last theres a nagging sense that as the country braces for recession and media companies see their stock prices plunge stars could start to feel the pinch after years of free spending netflix has signaled to investors that it is serious about maintaining its operating margins at 19 to 20 thats made the streamer much more selective about writing huge checks for buzzy projects at the same time companies like warner bros discovery are grappling with heavy debt loads and have made a commitment to slash costs to be fair apple with a market cap of 24 trillion seems unlikely to be forced to belttighten but at some point all this economizing will have a trickledown effect in terms of star salaries matt donnelly and rebecca rubin contributed to this report more from our brands rolling stone brian cox willing to return
