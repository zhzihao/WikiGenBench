passed here with a slightly smaller margin compared with the citywide average propositions 15 and 21 basically matched the la averages the most significant differentiator was proposition 22 which failed by the narrowest of margins fewer than 5000 votes out of almost 131000 cast though its 2020 voting pattern is pretty similar to the citys overall tinseltown doesnt particularly resemble la as a whole among all the political neighborhoods this one has by far the largest share of the white votingage population at 63 percent and its the only political neighborhood where every ballot group is at least a plurality white it also has the smallest share of the hispanic votingage population at just 13 percent six of the seven ballot groups where proposition 16 garnered less support than the city average had a higher share of votingage white residents than the neighborhood and the city overall hollywood stars and industry leaders have split on caruso and bass with each candidate collecting endorsements from a number of big names and given the liberal but not too liberal voters of tinseltown it seems as though this neighborhood could go either way inner suburbs the inner suburbs is a

demographically diverse but as it nears the san joaquin valley to the north wealthier communities like woodland hills and chatsworth begin to tack right and down south the historically industrial harbor communities and the shoestring strip are a little less conservative than their northern counterparts three of the four ballot groups voted in support of measure j compared with just four of the 12 comprising the political neighborhoods northern reaches and two voted in favor of proposition 15 while bass has made efforts to reach out to this political neighborhood its reasonable to think that

citing bass win along with a broader transformation in local political leadershipfive years ago there were two women on los angeles city council and none held citywide office by the end of 2022 at least five women will be seated on the council and two will hold citywide office  bass and incoming city atty hydee feldstein soto at the county level women now hold all five seats on the powerful

control of a city marred by corruption scandals with a spiraling homelessness crisis and profound inequities deepened by the covid19 pandemicconfidence in local government is seemingly at a nadir after a series of city hall indictments in recent years and the release of a leaked audio recording less than a month before the election that revealed top officials making racist comments and scheming to maintain political powerin the days before the election bass said her first priority upon taking office would be to declare a state of emergency on homelessness and work to get people housed in a city where as many as 41000 people sleep in tents rvs and other makeshift housing california how la city hall became so corrupt a recent history of bribes kickbacks scandal leaks the los angeles political world is no stranger to scandal in fact there have been so many it can be hard to keep them straight june 13 2023 the citys first competitive mayoral race in nearly a decade was a story of contrasts with two candidates who symbolized divergent visions of the citybass a black woman has spent decades in public service evolving from an activist organizer to pragmatic elected official as she fought for incremental gains in underserved la communities the former assembly speaker and sixterm member of congress has a reputation as a decidedly lowkey politician known for her skills as a coalitionbuildercaruso a white man built a real estate empire on spectacle and spectacular attention to detail creating highly controlled private spaces like the grove shopping center that evoke an idealized version of urban life his highsheen candidacy  which largely focused on his easily digestible pledge to clean up la  painted the former police commission president as a political outsider with the business chops to succeed where longtime politicians had failedultimately however it was the candidates disparate political histories that became the defining divide of the race california how karen bass went from south la activist to mayoral hopeful la mayoral candidate karen bass combines the focus on equity from her activist days with the practicality she learned in sacramento and washingtonmay 29 2022 bass a lifelong democrat built up a virtual wall of support from the democratic establishment in the general election those lockstep endorsements from democratic elected officials and clubs helped buttress bass frequent contention that she was the only democrat in the race to lead an overwhelmingly blue city the real estate developer registered as a democrat for the first time in late january less than three weeks before he declared his candidacy party history weighed less heavily during the early months of a primary defined by voter frustrations around homelessness and crime but carusos republican past became an inescapable albatross in the summer and fallthis race  the first modern la mayoral election to be held in an even year synced up with state and federal elections  advanced amid an encroaching backdrop of hyperpartisan national politicsthe rancorous battle for control of congress was never far from view and the us supreme courts decision to overturn roe vs wade two weeks after the june primary made abortion rights an unlikely but potent campaign issue caruso loudly touted his support for abortion rights throughout the race but his past donations to antiabortion politicians and murky history on the issue lent bass a formidable line of attackcaruso blanketed his campaign materials with the word democrat and largely sought to avoid discussion of his partisan political evolution on the trail but he shifted tactics in midoctober airing a tv ad that addressed the subject head on and discussed how the republican party shifted to a place that didnt represent my valueshis campaign hoped to replicate the success of richard riordan a centrist republican businessman whose victorious 1993 bid for mayor relied on his outsider bona fides and a thenrecordbreaking influx of the firsttime candidates personal funds riordan succeeded tom bradley the citys first black mayor who was elected in 1973 and shepherded los angeles through a twodecade tenure as mayor the 2022 race grew uglier in its final months as both candidates fought fire with fire much of the bombardment centered on one of the most prominent private institutions in the city with bass and caruso attacking their opponents relationships to scandals at usc caruso also hit bass for a speech she gave praising scientology bass and her supporters frequently hammered caruso for his republican past with her allies branding him as a liar and a phony california usc scandals assume starring role in la mayors race with bass caruso pointing fingers karen bass and rick caruso are attacking each others character and ethics particularly when it comes to their alma matersept 11 2022 bass became an immediate frontrunner when she entered the race last fall more than four months before carusothe real estate developer built some of the regions bestknown retail centers but had little name recognition when he entered the field unprecedented spending and an onslaught of advertising helped caruso surge propulsively into contention and finish second in the primary but bass retained her status as a robust frontrunner through much of the monthslong battle to succeed garcettiit was only in the final weeks of the race that polling significantly tightened as caruso poured roughly 3 million to 4 million a week into his barrage of advertisingcaruso aimed to run up his lead with san fernando valley voters latinos and moderates but bass maintained strong backing from women liberals and registered democratsbass political consciousness took shape at
