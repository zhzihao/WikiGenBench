The game revolves around Brian Lee, a man who is sent to the future to investigate an inevitable zombie outbreak while accompanied by his daughter, Eva. The gameplay consists of killing zombies and collecting resources while exploring a city.\n\nThe game was released on June 30, 2023, and was poorly received by critics, who saw it as a knockoff of 2013's The Last of Us. The Last Hope Eva was found to be highly reminiscent of The Last of Us Ellie. Other common criticisms of the game included the use of deceptive advertising, frustrating gameplay, and launching with various bugs. The game was removed from the Nintendo eShop on August 1, 2023, and its trailers were taken down by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It has been used as an example of Nintendo eShop shovelware, and has been considered one of the worst video games of 2023.\n\nGameplay \n\nThe gameplay of The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival consists of killing zombies while exploring a post-apocalyptic city as protagonist Brian Lee. The player has a health bar and stamina bar, and can access four weapons throughout the game: a handgun, assault rifle, baseball bat, and craftable Molotov cocktail. The game features other objectives for the player to complete, such as lock picking. During these objectives, Brian Lee is accompanied by Eva. Close encounters with enemies will result in Eva running away and cowering, and she is unable to leave her cowering state until all zombies nearby are killed. If Eva dies, the player will be sent back to the last checkpoint. There is a limited amount of ammunition within the game, and the baseball bat will drain the player's stamina, which will not regenerate without the use of a limited item. As a result of this, mistakes made by the player may create an unwinnable situation.\n\nPlot \nIn The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival, a zombie outbreak is predicted to occur in the near future, which will wipe out 95% of the world population, infect 4%, and leave 1% to survive. To investigate this, a man named Brian Lee is sent to the future and wakes up in a hospital ward. After leaving the hospital and going to a library, he meets a girl cowering in the corner named Eva, who assures Brian that she is not infected, though she says she needs medicine from the pharmacy and that her mother is dead. Shortly after the two meet, Eva reveals that she is Brian's daughter from the future. Throughout the course of the game, Brian escorts Eva across the city while killing zombies. After traversing through the city and defeating the undead, they board a boat and depart safely.\n\nDevelopment and release \nThe Last Hope was developed by Virtual Global Games (VG Games), a company based in Chișinău. The company is sometimes known as West Connection Limited. VG Games was noted before the creation of the game for creating low-quality Nintendo Switch games, such as Need for Drive – Car Racing and Gangster Life: Criminal Untold, Cars, Theft, Police. The Last Hope was released for the Nintendo eShop exclusively in the United Kingdom on June 30, 2023. An international release never occurred, and it is unknown if the game was planned to come to other regions.\n\nThe game's trailer went viral on YouTube and it received media coverage. According to TheGamer, the game reached thousands of downloads, possibly due to its low price point. The game was removed from the eShop on August 1 and its trailers were taken down shortly afterwards following copyright claims from Sony Interactive Entertainment.\n\nReception \n\nThe Last Hope was released to a poor reception from critics. Several publications pointed out the game's plagiarized character designs. Kotaku referred to the game as the \"dollar store\" version of The Last of Us, pointing out that Eva wore the same outfit as Ellie and had a similar appearance. Chris McMullen of The Escapist likened her personality to that of a \"rotting yak carcass\". The gameplay was strongly criticized. Andrew Heaton of Digital Foundry considered it the worst game he had ever played, citing the limited ammunition making some combat scenarios impossible, saved data being erased when skipping loading screens, and an inaccessible room due to the requirement of keyboard controls. McMullen also likened the game to torture, and James Stephanie Sterling described it as an \"underhanded, slipshod piece of shit\". McMullen criticized the clumsy writing, such as \"you dead\" (in all caps) in the game over screen, and Brian's line \"Just like my yet to come daughter\" upon meeting Eva.\n\nThe performance of the game was another common complaint. Digital Foundry pointed out numerous graphical and performance flaws, such as doors being able to crash the game, frame rate dips, and flickering shadows. These were cited by other publications to prove that the game used deceptive advertising on consumers, as the game's eShop description advertised a \"captivating plot\", \"immersive graphics\", and \"meaningful choices\". The game has been regarded as an example of an abundant shovelware problem on the Nintendo eShop, which has been noted to have a large variety of low-quality games. Kotaku argued that Nintendo needs to bring quality control to its storefront. Digital Foundry said The Last Hope is one of \"depravity festering within certain corners of the industry\", labeling the game as \"scam\", having \"no redeeming features whatsoever\". TheGamer attributed the uptick in sales on the Nintendo eShop as being the \"morbid sense of curiosity\" from consumers seeing the negative reception of the game in headlines, followed by immediately claiming that the game was a \"garbage ripoff\". Eurogamers Victoria Kennedy humorously considered it an example of the joke \"we have The Last of Us at home\", referencing the opinion that The Last Hope is a low-quality copy of The Last of Us, and Eurogamer Germany wrote that a TV test pattern would be more entertaining to watch. It has been considered one of the worst games of 2023 by Kotaku and IGN.\n\nSee also \n Calculator (Nintendo Switch)another product cited when criticizing the eShop's quality control\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\n2023 video games\nNintendo Switch games\nNintendo Switch-only games\nThird-person shooters\nSingle-player video games\nSurvival video games\nVideo games about time travel\nVideo games about viral outbreaks\nVideo games about zombies\nVideo games involved in plagiarism controversies", "unikey": "The Last Hope: Dead Zone Survival", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Gameplay", "Plot", "Development_and_release", "Reception", "See_also", "Notes", "References"], "contents": ["The gameplay ofThe Last Hope: Dead Zone Survivalconsists of killing zombies while exploring a post-apocalyptic city as protagonist Brian Lee.

foundrywest connection limited feature by john linneman senior staff writer digital foundry published on 13 jul 2023 83 comments if youre looking for a suitable alternative to licking the toilet bowl west connection limited has you covered theyre bringing a veritable buffet of unfinished barely functional smoking hot garbage to the table that makes ljn look like nintendo in building its catalogue of fetid bile west connection has mastered the art of the seo game through a collection of vaguely assembled words designed explicitly to fool customers into wasting their money and time like call of duty or battlefield try world war battle heroes field armies call of prison duty simulator  or maybe counter bottle shooter pro aim master target bottle shoot 3d game strike pistol john linneman hosts this troubling look at the worst the nintendo eshop has to offer in glorious 4k once you reach the bottom of the stairs however youre greeted by a much longer loading screen that eventually takes you into the city the entirety of this game takes place in and around this ushaped street littered with zombies and muscle cars the world is slathered in low resolution repeating textures with virtually no lighting shadows are exceptionally lowres and barely coherent the last hope boasts a fully dynamic framerate which can range from 60fps all the way down to an eyepopping 15 in certain instances the game appeared to break with visible glitching appearing across the screen weird blooming artefacts flickering shadows and broken alpha textures even worse opening any door in the game has a small percentage chance of crashing the game causing you to lose all progress oh and when you reboot the game theres also a risk of hitting the new game option by accident as the main menu is active beneath the unity splash screen whoops all story telling is handled via text boxes which often awkwardly intersect with other ui elements as i noted earlier there is no voice acting in this game and the writing itself makes twitter posts read more like tolstoy oh and then theres the soundtrack  apart from a song in the main menu theres just one song in actual gameplay if you count what sounds like a recording of somebody snoring as a soundtrack this is the only ambient sound in the entire game and you will hear it from start to finish heres how eva stacks up against ellie  as you can see west connection opted to use a lowquality bootleg of ellies model with the same outfit and design theres no lighting shading or detail present here and whats up with those eyes somehow though its the design and economy of this game that fascinates me the most this is basically a 15minute game if you play it correctly but its very easy to break the game entirely to understand this lets look at the games economy without any kind of facial animation dialogue is hilariously unconvincing it turns out pressing e on the switch to open a door is an impossible challenge visual glitches are commonplace such as these problems with the traffic lights after leaving the pharmacy the game asks you to lockpick this police car  the second of three total lock picking minigames in the game problem is the game does not pause while picking the lock but no indication is given that youre being attacked so when you finish this minigame the camera pulls out and you instantly die no matter what even worse the game usually softlocks on the you dead screen forcing you to quit the game entirely and restart it just be careful not to spam through the unity logo and start a new game by accident to finish this minigame you need to kill each zombie in the area  which means you need enough bullets and bat swings to eliminate them all if you reached this point without the required ammo you wont be able to do it oh and thats not even touching on the ellie er eva problem  halfway through the game you encounter her in the library and she begins to follow you if eva comes within spitting distance of a zombie she enters a crouch and will remain there until all zombies are dispatched with the limited number of enemies you can kill this becomes a real problem as it can leave you without enough ammo to finish the game if she crouches at the wrong spot youll wind up snaking along the outside of the city and once she crouches hope that you can make it to the next loading screen before she dies what makes this all the more hilarious is the structure objectives are laid out in a linear fashion on this ushaped boulevard you are always locked into specific sections of this street until you complete each objective so theres no opportunity for exploration from the moment you leave the hospital the game will present exactly 15 objectives before you complete it just variations on entering an area searching for items and leaving these games produced by students at a local german university absolutely wipe the floor with anything west connection limited has produced for example take a look at the unique mechanics of repeat after me the level editor for which was featured at 1422 in the video and in the first image above so yeah what else can i say the products produced by west connection limited are the eshop equivalent of browser popup packed with malware and its disappointing that nintendo even allows such a product onto their shop this also got me thinking about smaller projects in general i mean check out the unitybased projects created by students at a local university above  they feature clever interesting ideas with functional mechanics and an original visual design these are games made by students still learning about games and they absolutely wipe the floor with anything west connection limited has ever produced of course were not the only ones to have put this game through its paces  our colleagues at eurogamer have already done so  and attempts to get comment on the game from both nintendo and sony were attempted but so far neither firm has replied testing the last hope has been both cathartic yet also eye opening id mostly ignored the shovelwareinfested digital storefronts and assumed many of them were innocuous but when you see something like this it really pulls back the curtain on the depravity festering within certain corners of the industry the last hope is designed to take your money there is no game here  this is effectively a scam we all knew this from the trailer but the fact that the actual game is so much less than even that awful trailer is genuinely shocking next time you find yourself looking at something like a redfall or

shortly after it was dribbled onto the nintendo switchs eshop for allegedly being a blatant ripoff of the last of us its artwork is a deliberate nod to the naughty dog classic while the girl sidekick featured in this games miserable campaign is practically a plagiarism of ellie this is however where comparisons to the last of us end the game itself is a particularly incompetent zombie shooter asset flip that has swindled attention for itself by pretending to be a clone of a better game yes this vile product is such a lazy hack job it couldnt be bothered to actually rip the last of us off with one piece of art and a single character model it got a bunch of news coverage in a manner that could only be described as fraudulent i cant deny it worked im reviewing it after all journey to the library to safe sic an innocent girl from reckless zombies reads the last hopes eshop description head on to the pharmacy to secure vital medical supplies explore the police station to arm yourself with powerful weaponry and venture into the dark depths of the metro tunnels where unexpected horrors awaitthis supposed summary of the premise is in fact a description of the entire game from start to finish thats it thats the whole game except for the part about unexpected horrors which is an outright fucking lie no unexpected horrors await there are maybe four zombie character models recycled over and over again for the entire duration of this game they are all that await anybody foolish enough to embark on the last hopes pathetic adventure aesthetically and mechanically identical to one of dozens of basement grade zombie games you can find on steam this brief and barely functional monument to spurious jank isnt even entertainingly bad its brief boring and broken a minimum viable product the skeletal nature of which makes its presentation as a last of us forgery all the more duplicitous and insulting the story is ridiculous but like everything else its too vapidly delivered to be funny in its absurdity you play as brian a man sent into the future because the government predicts a zombie outbreak will happen and they just want to see what its like throughout the campaign brian will do nothing to advance any sort of overarching plot to the point that time travel seems tacked onto things for the sheer fuck of it government discloses shocking revelations about future crisis and launches investigation intervention of time machine raises concerns over impending zombie outbreak and human survival explains the games opening text with an almost incomprehensible amount of word salad their unprecedented journey unveiled a world plagued by an unprecedented crisis  a devastating zombie outbreakanyway the character who looks like ellie but is totally not ellie turns out to be brians daughter in the future its a plot point that has no implications as it never comes up after brian figures out this revelation two minutes after meeting her then again given how short this game is two minutes constitutes a huge chunk of progression you can finish this thing in maybe thirty minutes if you dont account for the times youll have to start over from the beginning thanks to a softlock its very easy to make the game unwinnable due to the fact resources are intensely limited and if you fight too much fail to anticipate the correct way to move through the zombies or use the sprint command at all youre pretty much fucked i could almost believe the stamina meter was a vicious parody of the mechanic if the last hope wasnt so pitifully incompetent stamina does not regenerate ever you need it for all melee attacks as well as sprinting and when its gone its gone theres a grand total of three consumable items that return a piddling amount of stamina without which you cannot swing your baseball bat similarly ammunition for the handgun and later assault rifle is limited to such a degree that if you kill more zombies than you explicitly have to youre completely unable to defend yourself and may well have to start from the very beginning  naturally there is only one save file which autosaves regardless of how unwinnable things become which zombies you should kill is something youll just need to guess and youll only start guessing that if you realize most of them shouldnt be approached or fought in the first place without an upfront warning like the one ive just given youll almost certainly maneuver yourself into that aforementioned unwinnable position robbed of your ability to shoot or smack a single thing once you meet notellie the rest of the game becomes one terrible escort mission with a little millstone that if i suspected any thought went into it at all id say seems actively designed to torture the player she follows brian at a pace best described as suicidal and will let him get a good few yards ahead of her before she even bothers to start moving if a zombie comes within a generous few feet of her shell instantly stop and cower inviting enemies to murder her in seconds and she wont consider moving again until everything in the vicinity is dealt with the only time she breaks this behavior is in one corridor near the end of the game filled with a large group of zombies where she is apparently programmed to suddenly run ahead and cower in front of them its incredibleone saving grace is that if you can make it to the next area before she gets merked shell be with you when it loads no matter how far you run ahead sometimes getting anywhere is impossible though because notellie is more than happy to stand in your way and trap you in a corner somewhere unable to move out of your way because shes programmed only to follow brian and his gormless face gameplay basically consists of fighting as little as possible and hugging walls when you can to stay out of the aggro range of any zombies on the way its not exactly enthralling but considering how most of your resources have to last the entire game its the best way to guarantee youll see the thrilling conclusion in which you walk a short distance past an entire horde of zombies you dont need to engage and stand near a boat to see the static piece of artwork that constitutes an ending you dont even get any credits the game instead dumping you unceremoniously back to its main menu at least the con merchant who made this thing had the common sense to remain anonymous the last hope attempts a handful of additional mechanics the lofty audacity of which serves as its only amusing element theres a lockpicking minigame that occurs twice and is just an insipid series of timed button presses its important to note that zombies continue to move around while youre on the lockpicking screen though they seemingly wont attack until youre finished at which point you may return to find yourself surrounded and killed in seconds a crafting system  perhaps the only other nod to the last of us  exists but its only used to craft two molotov cocktails after acquiring the components for them towards the end and the only time i ever used one was on the final section just for the sake of it there really isnt much more to mention except for the one door that cant be opened because you have to press the e key to do so and this games on the fucking switch its one thing to rip another game off but to only pretend to rip one off for attention while doing something so threadbare it doesnt even clear the low bar of plagiarism truly is deceptive on a whole other level the last hope dead zone survival is not a forgery of the last of us  its a forgery of a forgery its something so completely fucking fraudulent that it sells the idea of a counterfeit and delivers instead a handful of minimally functional assets structured just barely enough to resemble half an hour of navigable gameplay fuck off the last hope you underhanded slipshod piece of shit and fuck me for wasting everybodys time by reviewing you 0510reviewsarticlesif you liked this post

article this has been a super annoying problem with the current eshop 37 2paradoxfawkessat 12th aug 2023 just use the site deku deals track your favorite games block the ones you dont want to see then go buy it on the eshop i never use the eshop to look for games 28 3nhsnorksat 12th aug 2023 why do i not find it all laborious i wonder perhaps because i know what age i live in and try to make use of what it offers deku deals social media newsblogs like nl itself here when it covers new announcements instead of fanbloid junk the only reason many eshop gems still slip past me nonetheless is the sheer multitude of these very gems not the shovelware fandubbed or otherwise supposedly clouding the sun off doesnt mean that occasional legit copyright infringements and fake screenshots shouldnt be legally flyswatted even if i successfully survived a much greater magnitude of the latter as a postsoviet gamer kid but the rest are pretty harmless and mostly a smirk catalyst for anyone with the video game hobby for longer than a couple yearsi dont view crutching this hobby with abovestandard content curation as some kind of customer right  if anyone buys a game titled san gangster andreas fight for city for anything other than ss  giggles although people seeking that on eshop are probably more in the market for aaa clock or finding the offered content idly amusing enough to justify the two bucks most such titles seem perennially discounted to its frankly on them 4 4athfjman18sat 12th aug 2023 the eshop is a wasteland of trash titles it reminds me of the massive amount of shovelware that was produced for the wii so many bad games on that consolei actively avoid searching through the eshop it is such a slog with how slow it is and just feels soulless i only really seeread about indie games that are reported by video gaming websites in the hopes they report on the decent indie games sure im gonna miss a gem or two but in a sea of garbage the likelihood of finding gold yourself is slim 8 5bobbsat 12th aug 2023 ive been wishing we could blacklist games out of our searches for a long time everytime you enter the discounts section to see what capcom squarenix and ubisoft are offering us this month its buried deep in hentai vs evil games 14 6kimyonaakumasat 12th aug 2023 it feels inevitable with any online store but its a shame i remember when the switch eshop didnt have a ton of games but there were some real gems there anything of its sort would go under the radar these dayspersonally im not venturing beyond my wishlist but i shouldnt have to curate my own eshop in the first place 0 7max_the_germansat 12th aug 2023 but which one is better aaa clock ultra ultimate or aaa clock ultra extended 17 8rpgloversat 12th aug 2023 first time i saw this game i have nothing to say than laugh 1 9fishyssat 12th aug 2023 3 10calbeausat 12th aug 2023 the suggestions for improving the eshop are all spot on even just a rating system and better filtering options will go a long way in keeping these snakesinthegrass off your search results 3 11lightsiydsat 12th aug 2023 max_the_german aaa clock ultimate ultra extended but wait for the premium edition 4 12danijoexthepierrotsat 12th aug 2023 huhcome to the think of iti dont think ive ever played any of these scam games but im very familiar with shovelware games and it became very common throughout the 7th midgeneration psn mostly psp  the wiidsi shop were quite flooded with those types of games cant say much for xbox liveeven steam has this issue online storefronts need serious quality control at this point if nothing is done this problem is only gonna grow bigger  bigger 2 13serpenterrorsat 12th aug 2023 0 14premko1sat 12th aug 2023 just dont buy it  its always good to have a choice but is easy to criticize  but when sellers advertise their games with some fake screenshots thats another thing    3 15zzalapskisat 12th aug 2023 11 16supercharlie78sat 12th aug 2023 the ability to favourite or mute publishers is another possibility allow people to blacklist certain developers so they dont show in the listings and search results would strike an instant blow at the scam game sellersoh yes please 7 17princess_lillysat 12th aug 2023 at this point every single console store  psn mss eshop steam  is a trash can gog might be a bit of an exception but lets face it  were going there to get our early 00s fix and theres a filter for thati cant really say why people are still scamable why people buy obviously trashy games a quick 5 minutes search will tell you everything you want about a game and if you want to buy a game without even doing that  its on you buddy 2 18daniel36sat 12th aug 2023 a somewhat useful solution would be the ability to permanently hide games you know wont be interesting but that option will never be implemented 2 19ladycharliesat 12th aug 2023 i often browse the recent releases just to see whats newand i wonder why baltaro games has multiple listings for moto gt and urban flow or why red deer games has twenty one different listings of bit orchardthis article reminds me why 1 20electrolite77sat 12th aug 2023 im old enough that i started gaming on an 8but computer and this has always been an issue when ever i went to a shop for a tape for my amstrad cpc there was tons of budget priced shovelware on the shelvescartridges stopped it a bit though there were still lots of terrible games on the megadrive especially since the ps1 and the cheaper costs of cd every successful system has tons of rubbish its just the way it isi still dont understand how people get scammed by these cheap imitations given the wealth of information we have available to us to ascertain which games are worth buying nor does it bother me for the same reason i dont go on any digital store to browse and buy what they want to sell me i go on there with a game in mind buy it and move on 6 21cashewssat 12th aug 2023 scam games have been around forever when i was a little kid looking for c64 games id buy it for the box  nothing in the game worked past 30 minutes or sothey evolve over time but the more they change the more they stay the same 2 22atlanteanmansat 12th aug 2023 6 23kingofredlionssat 12th aug 2023 0 24robotreptilesat 12th aug 2023 its embarrassing this gen with nintendos lack of quality control all the hentai stuff in particular makes me irritated to check the eshop sometimeseven if nintendo assembled a small team to cull the most blatant offenders it would be a huge step 3 25speedrunrockssat 12th aug 2023 rcmadiax has stepped up their game 3 26fortang1980sat 12th aug 2023 its definitely hard to browse the eshop with all these low quality games especially since scrolling through the eshop has horrible load times to begin with i used to look for good games on sale but i stopped doing that a while ago now i just wish list games i know are good and wait for them to go salei have an xbox and their eshop doesnt seem as bad so is this just a nintendo problem right now 1 27fortang1980sat 12th aug 2023 also some games that sound cheap are actually good  my wife loves power wash simulator  but there has to be a way to filter out the junk 1 28laxeybobbysat 12th aug 2023 i have subscribed to lukes youtube channel before it was switchstars and i highly recommend subscribing to his channel to get his videos on these scammers his sense of humour and commentary make these videos hilarious to watch luke has other switch related video content worth checking out too looking at the eshop coming soon there are already another three scam games set to release and no doubt luke has his eyes set on these for contentto show how lucrative of a scam this is if you took only 01 of switch users of the 125million switch consoles sold and they purchased these scam games be it out of curiosity or being caught by the scam then that is 125000 people paying 499 which is the common price for their release that nets them 623750 for a single game that probably cost them 100 to makeeven if you did the math for the game selling at 099 these scammers take 123750 per game 2 29cutchuslowsat 12th aug 2023 why does nintendo allow these scam games on the eshop 3 30magnus374sat 12th aug 2023 i dont really have any problem with it i check the new releases each sunday and mark the ones that looks interesting i love that there are many games instead of a censored wasteland that said publisher that is actively lying is a problem and if the game doesnt have what is promised then you should be able to get your money back 1 31ortadragoonxsat 12th aug 2023 paradoxfawkesdeku deals is one the greatest websites ive ever usedi use it for both digital switch games and for physical ps5 games 4 32metalmansat 12th aug 2023 i wonder how much money the devs actually bring in from these games im almost tempted to throw something together on the cheap and see how well it does 2 33bodkindqsat 12th aug 2023 ive noticed the influx of cheap obvious rip off games of late and its tedious to have to scroll through all the crap to find the established ips or even the indie games that actually try and are good its giving a bad name to indies i mean games like sea of stars still looks promising and i did enjoy my time with undertale and celeste but it makes you just start ignoring indies cos you know most of it aint worth a dime getting sick of seeing all these lazy hentai games getting released lately too 2 34princess_lillysat 12th aug 2023 kingofredlions i just ignore that stuff but yeesh that is nasty i have a lot of respect for gog since they actually preserve great 00s games instead of pushing 20s shovelware but that thing with a porn game that cannot continuewhat was the game though some anime or realistic its not that bad if it was just anime but real life porn is just nasty 0 35jayjsat 12th aug 2023 ive been saying this for years the switch eshop has a real shovelware problem its been awful trying to sift through everything these days its why i can pretty much only browse my wishlist for sale items these days 0 36iceearthguardsat 12th aug 2023 0 37carlos82sat 12th aug 2023 the switch eshop is awful not only is garbage like the above given as much prominence as actual competently made games the sales section is filled with this rubbish as well on top of that its painfully slow to navigate nintendo really need to get on top of this for a switch successor 0 38iceearthguardsat 12th aug 2023 also hopefully nintendos next console has a better eshop than the switch 0 39carlos82sat 12th aug 2023 princess_lilly they all have them but the eshop is the worst in the sense that all games are given equal billing all of the others have some form of curating to feature new releases and with steam its very easy to follow developers and be notified of their games plus sales on games are much more controlled where as here anyone can put their game on sale and theyre all slapped together in a huge pile 0 40stambrosiussat 12th aug 2023 in the wii u days we did not have this problem you could discuss games on miiverse and there werent that many games to begin witheverybody was more or less playing the same stuff 1 41eelsat 12th aug 2023 4 42electrolite77sat 12th aug 2023 atlanteanmannintendo has always been about money and control they only exist to make money theyre actually less controlling than they used to be as you see in the masses of games available for the switch 0 43electrolite77sat 12th aug 2023 stambrosiuseveryone was playing the same thing because there were hardly any games lets not go back to the dark times 4 44ninjanickysat 12th aug 2023 i know im missing out on some great indie games but i refuse to download anything from a developer ive not heard of because of these cheap knockoff games the playstation store is getting just as bad as well there needs to be some kind of filter to stop these junk games getting through 0 45worldsat 12th aug 2023 2 46greenxiiisat 12th aug 2023 my friends and i always joke about bringing a shovel with us to dig through all the eshops shovelware games there are a lot of wonderful indie games out there but thats not what were talking about 0 47kingofredlionssat 12th aug 2023 princess_lilly yes i absolutely agree with you there on the great work by gog in preserving old games  and getting them to run on newer systems toomy gog account is several years old now but i dont recall ever encountering any age or content filters when i created the account or since or ever being asked if im an adult or even being asked if im the target demographic male for those porn gamesthe emails that i received from gog were advertising some anime porn but the one i remember seeing on the homepage was some sort of scifi porno with characters rendered in a cg sort of cartoony semirealistic art style this was actually how i learnt that gog was now hosting porn there was no announcement no asking if anyone would like to opt out   0 48dualmasksat 12th aug 2023 one driving factor that leads me to shopping more on steam and much less on switch for my digital games is this very issue thanks to reviews and the refund process while there is a lot of dreck on steam its easy to spot easy to avoid and easy enough to get your money back if you do get burnt in some way its like nintendo is making zero effort to make sure their shop has anything resembling quality control whatever happened to the good ol nintendo seal of quality 1 49lavatwilightsat 12th aug 2023 great article thanksa couple of years ago before this became an issue i trawled every game in the eshop and favourited the ones that looked mildly interesting and either waited for a sale or bought them outright when i had no game to play and wanted something quick since then ive only ever really had to check the new section and ive avoided this whole issueof course i dont recommend doing that now that theres so much of this dross to sift through 0 50nimniosat 12th aug 2023 fortang1980 power wash simulator is published by square enix and has a overwhelmingly positive rating on steam so it doesnt fit the description of a scam game in my opinion 1 51princess_lillysat 12th aug 2023 kingofredlions ok that is really horrible i think that you have to accept the store policy when you open an account there though and there might have been the i am 18 infostill not making any sort of filter towards such things is a huge nope on their sidecarlos82 i havent really looked at it this way i thought steam had the worst filters they let anything in but i dont think its that much of a problem i mean 5 seconds of gameplay video is enough to see if a game has any quality 0 52coalescencesat 12th aug 2023 1 53carlos82sat 12th aug 2023 princess_lilly yeah theres probably worse games on steam but its also much easier for a user to avoid and see the games thatll likely interest them 0 54impossibiliumsat 12th aug 2023 kingofredlions im not offended by porn gamesand i found their emails advertising sales for them amusing more than offensiveso i never noticed that there was no way to filter them out that is definitely a problem and they should really look into that but they are based in poland and most european countries have much different attitudes toward sexual contenti disagree that gog is worse than steam when it comes to those games you wouldnt notice this because you wouldnt understandably seek them out but gog at least curates their porn games they are actual games with at least some amount of quality with regards to gameplay on steam 99 of porn games are sliding block puzzles and asset flips masquerading as real games much like the garbage this article points out gog is really good when it comes to quality control on their storefront 2 55jojobarsat 12th aug 2023 those scam games anoy me for quite some timeim a game developer myself and i put a lot of time tears and love into my work and those scam companies make it so hard for us good developers to get visibility which is the most important thing nowadays to make a living 0 56samaliksat 12th aug 2023 0 57princess_lillysat 12th aug 2023 carlos82 true datbut all in all if someone buys a game without looking at it first its on them 0 58mr_bennsat 12th aug 2023 i cant remember the last time i shopped on the eshop i tend to buy everything via deku deals now and then it magically turns up on the switch which even now impresses me that i can buy something on one device and its delivered to another 1 59luke937sat 12th aug 2023 0 60fortang1980sat 12th aug 2023 nimnio i agree still there should be a way to filter good games like that out from the junk 0 61kingofredlionssat 12th aug 2023 princess_lilly i think you must be right about that im thinking there had to have been some sort of tickbox to confirm my age when i created my gog account but it was so long ago i just cant remember now however even while logged out porn was advertised right there on the homepage meaning it was easily accessible by anyone under 18s included big nope indeed s 0 62chaotic_neutralsat 12th aug 2023 this is exactly the reason i stopped browsing the switchs eshop it was painfully slow to trawl through pages of crap in the sale sectioni love how xbox puts everything into easy to navigate sections makes things so much easier for those impulse buys  which is 90 of how i buy games 0 63dugansat 12th aug 2023 every week since switchs launch i have checked out the whats new news for the past year or two it has been devolving and with more bad games there is no corresponding better search optionsbut that really doesnt bother me since i will be playing only totk for the rest of my life 2 64kingofredlionssat 12th aug 2023 impossibilium heh my experience on steam and gog has been very different and id say steam for me has turned out to be miles betterdespite my never seeking them out my steam recommendations used to be full of anime porn games for some reason i play lots of cute cat games and apparently that was enough of a reason for steams algorithm to decide itd be a great idea to recommend hundreds of schoolgirl anime porn games to me yes every single day it was relentless fortunately i was able to discuss this with a developer at valve and i sent him screenshots of my weird recommendations feed including some for actual adult only rated games that had slipped through the filters id set up i also told him that im female not even the right demographic for those pornos i remember saying to him it was the equivalent of male readers on amazon receiving recommendations for raunchy romance novels with a shirtless man on the cover xdhe was really nice and helpful and understanding and implemented some changes and not long after my recommendations feed showed a huge improvement and now shows me games im actually interested in since then ive bought several games on steam which i only knew the existence of thanks to receiving recommendations for them and spent zero on gog 0 65kingofredlionssat 12th aug 2023 samalik i understand what youre saying but to start with im not even part of the target demographic for those pornos im female sorry if my username gives the impression im male i chose it because i just really love this character so its a real problem when im subjected to porn unasked for its totally unwanted and unacceptable gaming is a fun hobby for me my happy place of escapism being subjected to porn in the gaming sphere makes it a very unwelcoming place for mewith all due respect i couldnt care less if those are quality porn games or shovelware its all the same to me i assure you im not sealing myself off from a classic in the making i am never in a hundred million years ever going to feel that i missed out because i opted out of porn i have a huge backlog of switch 3ds and pc games that would take a lifetime to actually get through im sure ill survive without some crappy porn games and as to your other suggestion no one male or female should ever be told no youre not allowed to opt out of seeing this you will be subjected to porn 0 66ryu_niiyamasat 12th aug 2023 2 67limitedtimesat 12th

otakus are allowed on the eshop every 5 seconds but nintendo themselves rejected spark the electric jester 2 from coming onto the same platform 0 69jeronansat 12th aug 2023 1 70danrenfroe2016sat 12th aug 2023 premko1 its sad my nephew falls for this crap quite often i try to tell him to search the internet for a review before he buys anything but he keeps getting scammed hes not the brightest sometimes 3 71headpiratesat 12th aug 2023 1 72n64roxsat 12th aug 2023 great article this topic really deserves proper discussionim usually of the opinion that open is better and the less the eshop is moderated the more interesting indieadult content will make it throughhowever these seo games do put me in mind of a story from earlier this year where a science fiction journal had to suspend all public submissions entirely because people were using chat gpt to bombard them with effectively infinite lowquality content were not quite at that point yet with the switch eshop but one might predict that its only a matter of time 1 73jorel262sun 13th aug 2023 3 74joeytssun 13th aug 2023 2 75thomysticsun 13th aug 2023 i love how transparent the name instantmarketingandgame isalso im not claiming credit since this problem is pretty evident but this isnt the first time one of my comments foreshadowed an article idea i appreciate nl for listening to its readers 1 76kryptonitekrunchsun 13th aug 2023 headpirateexcellent post exactly how i feel on this subject 0 77chromaticdraculasun 13th aug 2023 i actually feel bad for some of you at nintendolife having to report on some of the games releasing im not even talking about full on reviews i mean merely mentioning them in the thursday eshop update articles i know some of it is just copy pasting from the eshop listing but having to do itseriously thank you all for doing it but i know it cant be fun sometimesbasically thanks for making coming to this site multiple times a day fun 1 78construxsun 13th aug 2023 1 79johnnymindsun 13th aug 2023 not only censorship is never a good thing but making the greenlight process stricter is not the way also because it could potentially affect innocents along with if not instead of these scammersrefunds are also off the table as you then would have scammers on the customers side tooon the other hand all the suggestions about the eshop browsing in the article would definitely be welcomeall that said nowadays people really should check on the internet before buying anything they dont already know 0 80vivianeatsun 13th aug 2023 noe noe noe noe noe noe 0 81sputnik_cornersun 13th aug 2023 i have 1 rule when browsing the eshop or the playstation store if theres no gameplay video then i dont buy it simple as thateven if the game looks awesome i need to see gameplay and if theres no video on the store page then i assume the devs have something to hidei would make an exception if the game has been recommended or just looks awesome by looking up gameplay of my own accord but thats a very rare casethis rule has been very effective so far at meaning the games i buy are at least actual games and not garbage asset flips or scam games with stolen imagesbe careful out there gamers 0 82sputnik_cornersun 13th aug 2023 the real danger and issue with this is that the majority of people that will be fooled by these games are kids with parent money a kid might see those stolen images from gtav and think wow gtav for 199 or whatever and then purchase only to realise its a complete waste of money the worse ones are ones that cost a decent amount still like north of 1520 but are just complete trash these absolutely shouldnt be allowed on any online store front 0 83sputnik_cornersun 13th aug 2023 as the article mentions a refund policy like steam has based on timespentrelative completion of a game would solve most of the issues here steam has some real trash on there but i feel much safer trying out games because i know as long as i make my mind up quickly i can get a full refund no questions asked 1 84sputnik_cornersun 13th aug 2023 the eshop honestly just feels so bare bones basic like the bare minimum for whats acceptable for an online store front compared to steam or playstation i dont have an xbox anymore but i bet theirs is decent too the switch eshop just sucks no tags no decent search filters no personalised recommendations no notifications options to follow games devs or publishers its just a bit s1t really 0 85nesrockssun 13th aug 2023 please buy my legit game super hiking league dx 0 86ryu_niiyamasun 13th aug 2023 joeyts that is a lot of energy given the neutral tone of my post im perfectly fine with keeping a neutral viewat the end of the day i owe no one my purchase and consumer loyalty is earned and tested with each product not given the onus is still on the consumer to do their due diligence and research whatever they buy passionate devs and hit and run devs are indistinguishable if the product is not enjoyable to the consumer which is up to individual taste companies will do what the market allows however so long as there are people behind the keyboard i still think there is the potential for growth have a nice day 0 87joeytssun 13th aug 2023 2 88switch_prosun 13th aug 2023 nintendo needs to bring back the seal of quality not that it ever meant that the game will be good but at least they can filter out trash 0 89ryu_niiyamasun 13th aug 2023 0 90joeytssun 13th aug 2023 2 91greyfenyxsun 13th aug 2023 great article this is an issue that has gotten way out of hand and really needs to be addressed by nintendo luke over at switchstars does excellent work but he can only reach so many people ultimately the onus is on nintendo to ensure that at the very least a game actually is what its description claims it to be additional quality control would be extremely welcome but the bare minimum should include banning devs who utilize blatant false advertisement in every single one of their listingsid also like to address the people on here who seem to think this isnt an issue because players can simply do their research before buying a game the problem is most of these scam games get no reviews or coverage whatsoever and before you say that this fact alone should be a red flag ive found several gems that had little to no review coverage sometimes good games simply fly under the radar and for some consumers knowing the difference between a scam and a potential gem can be trickyfor example dezvolt recently released their scam version of the popular powerwash simulator game titled wash simulator within a day of that game going live i saw a post on reddit from someone wondering if it might offer a similar fix since the og powerwash simulator game is currently bugged on switch nobody had any experience with wash simulator and there were no reviews available to warn potential buyers away not at the time anyway though the latest video on switchstars does just that the person who wrote the post asking about this game was doing their due diligence in fact i would argue they did more than the average consumer would to look into this game yet nobody had any information to offer them on this title  at least until i saw their post and warned them about dezvolt games in general that said for all i know they may have already purchased the game before i commented and i wouldnt blame them for doing so especially at the current introductory sale pricemy point is you cant always find information about a game youre interested in and not finding information doesnt always mean the game is bad it may simply mean the game is new or that its flown under the radar the only solution to this mess is more regulation on nintendos part they need to check the quality of every game coming from new or unknown publishers once a publisher has earned a solid reputation by putting out quality games the certification process could be shortened considerably for that company in addition a review system should be implemented with developers whose games routinely receive one or two stars receiving penalties andor a revoking of all publishing rights on the platform these two things would go a long way towards fixing this problemtldr its unfair and unrealistic to put all the responsibility on the consumer to avoid scams that are specifically designed to fool the average consumer people should be able to trust that a game being sold on on a reputable gaming platforms eshop is  at a minimum  the game that is being advertised to them and preferably meets additional basic standards that would filter out asset flips and other scam games for a company that seems determined to overprotect its reputation when it comes to its own published games nintendo seems to care very little for the reputation of its platform overall 0 92ryu_niiyamasun 13th aug 2023 joeyts use of non public domain assets would be up to the original content creators to take action nintendos job is not to enforce copyright defense beyond their own their job is to do a lot check to make sure the game runs before allowing its sale on their store front but that is most certainly getting away from my original post and thus not of interest to me to pursue still not sure what you are looking for from me 0 93joeytssun 13th aug 2023 ryu_niiyama thats a round about way of saying that they are stealing work that isnt their own to falsely advertise their game which last i checked is illegal if doing it without permission the important question is why they are doing that in the first place its simple because they are tricking consumers thats the point of it all all of what ive mentioned the buzz word titles 90 discounts fake screenshots these are all what distinguish the motives behind midnight works in short they know exactly what they are doing by gaming the system and they are rightfully being called out for it theres no growth for the past year and a half it has been constant barrages of these same kinds of games from the same developer 1 94themodestmousesun 13th aug 2023 0 95darknyhtmon 14th aug 2023 this will always be an issue just look at all the pacman clones out there for how this worked in the atari era the cost of media made it unprofitable for a short while but there were still turds in the nes and snes era frequently with the nintendo seal of approval from companies like ljm that traded on brands instead of qualityfilters would help but cracking down on scam publishers would be as effective as ftc fines against robocallers they would just disband and form a new company the next dayin the end it is a moral issue more than anything else while people value profit above all else things tend to turn to dystopian quickly i dont think that the ferengi was intended to represent what corporate capitalists would turn into but man can the current crop make ferengi seem moral at times 0 96ryu_niiyamamon 14th aug 2023 joeyts you seem to be really irritated about these devs not sure what that has to do with me but again if they are doing something illegal then the copyright holders have recourse if they are putting out products that are considered subpar then it is up to the consumer to do research and to decide if the games arent profitable then they wont keep making them devs that work for this company still gotta start somewhere doesnt mean that they dont gain any new skills or that any of the beings involved cant produce a decent product eventually either way research and make informed decisions so please stop tagging me i have nothing to do with these companies and i am fine with doing my due diligence as a consumer ive been tricked by more passionate devs or rather the hype surrounding themthan not so i am not going to pitchfork about these products seriously have a nice day 0 97samalikmon 14th aug 2023 removed  disrespecting others 98joeytsmon 14th aug 2023 1 99ryu_niiyamamon 14th aug 2023 0 100joeytsmon 14th aug 2023 ryu_niiyama you kept replying to my points and tagging me back so clearly there was discussion happening but dont worry i wont be offended if you dont reply replying to a random user on the internet is never an obligation even on a relevant topic such as this 0 101demonkowmon 14th aug 2023 i love dekudeals as much as anyone here but it takes a fair amount of curating to not be a flood of garbage games on perpetual salebringing back the seal of quality would help even if not required to list a game we could at least filter them out if someone didnt get big n to vouch that its a real game youre always free to play a garbage game but it shouldnt drown all the little and niche games made in good faith by indies 0 102clammymon 14th aug 2023 for years nintendo used to be very harsh on who they even let publish on their consoles it was imho one of the reasons they lost out to the original playstation which had much less strict rules so a bigger catalog of gamesitd be awful to return to that but this is why we cant have nice things 1 103clammymon 14th aug 2023 0 104ulyssestue 15th aug 2023 an inherent issue with this whole problem is the fact that the video game industry is generally resistant to offering any sort of refund as long as scammers can deceive you all the way up to the instant you click the buy button they will continue getting away with it 1 105smithyotue 15th aug 2023 its not really the fault of the people that make this trash this is the fault of nintendo for induging a system and setup that makes this spam trash possible shame on nintendo for going from scrupulous about what they allow on their platforms to allowing every piece of garbage churned out 1 106dew12333tue 15th aug 2023 this is what success brings and as the digital game market increases then so will this 1 107krytturesun 24th sep 2023 daniel36 that wouldnt really help they would just release it again with a mega or ultra or some other extended or premium tacked on and it would be a new listing so you get to see it again it would just be whack a mole 0 108daniel36mon 25th sep 2023 krytture hide publisher then 0 109caleboi25tue 10th oct 2023 i miss the good ol daysof

eshop and ui is lack of quality control is just the cherry on top 0 113btb20sun 31st dec 2023 cutchuslow this is the real question why do they allow this 0 114btb20sun 31st dec 2023 caleboi25 that seal was never about game quality it was meant as a guarantee that the cartridge would work when inserted in the console 2 115serpenterrorsun 31st dec 2023 the last hope  dead zone survival redfall forspoken the day before street fighter 6 tmnt dlc the entire intellivision amico library 2 116atlanteanmanmon 1st jan 2024 the situation with the eshop is atrocious and inexcusable and its 100 percent on nintendo for flinging the floodgates open to seemingly anyone and any game its a nighunnavigable mess of garbage constantly pushing better games below the fold often within a single week its glut of trash games makes the wiis infamous mountain of shovelware look like a tiny anthill by comparisoni absolutely want full backwardscompatibility on the switch 2 but if it doesnt happen you can bet this will be one of the key excuses nintendo offers as to whyfor a situation of their own making 0 117legend_marioidmon 1st jan 2024 its a veritable ocean of games to start off with its a shame when good faith creative games are lost as they are dismissed as garbage thanks to their being too much of that in general i think i may have been duped once or twice but some trust d youtube sites and this site have generally really helped 0 118dennisreynoldsmon 1st jan 2024 this will never be fixed as nintendo just dont care lets face it the online store is terrible and again its because nintendo dont care i dont expect much improvement with the switch 2 0 119dennisreynoldsmon 1st jan 2024 serpenterror forspoken doesnt deserve to be on that list its not a great game far from it but its not a bad or broken game either its just very average and so so i will say its worth playing once it hits plus though as the movement system to explore the big if empty open world is a ton of fun and the combat is also pretty solid 0 120ironcoremon 1st jan 2024 any game which runs at 30 fps or requires the touchscreen is a scam game 0 tap here to load 120 comments leave a comment related
