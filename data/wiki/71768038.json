{"id": 71768038, "key": "Dear John (Taylor Swift song)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear%20John%20%28Taylor%20Swift%20song%29", "text": "\"Dear John\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift for her third studio album, Speak Now (2010). The title references the Dear John letter, which is a letter written to a man by his romantic partner to inform him that their relationship is over. Inspired by one of Swift's former partners, the lyrics are about a 19-year-old woman's tumultuous relationship with an older man. Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, \"Dear John\" is a slow-burning power ballad combining soft rock, electric blues, and country pop; the production incorporates electric guitar licks.\n\nIn Speak Now album reviews, many critics praised \"Dear John\" for its emotional impact and vivid lyrics about heartbreak; some criticized the lyrics as shallow and shortsighted. In retrospect, critics have regarded the track as one of Swift's best in her catalog because of its songwriting. \"Dear John\" peaked at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number 66 on the Canadian Hot 100. Swift included the song in the set list to her Speak Now World Tour (2010–2011). \n\nA re-recorded version, titled Dear John (Taylor's Version)\", was released as part of her third re-recorded album Speak Now (Taylor's Version) on July 7, 2023. The song peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Global 200 and entered on the charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the US.\n\nBackground and release \n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Taylor Swift began work on her third studio album, Speak Now (2010), two years prior to its release. According to Swift, the album is a collection of songs about the things she had wanted to but could not say to the people she had met in real life. In the liner notes for Speak Now, Swift explained that every song on the album is an \"open letter\" to someone in her life, \"telling them what I meant to tell them in person\", noting that one song in particular is addressed to \"someone who made my world very dark for a while\". When Rolling Stone journalist Brian Hiatt asked about the track's \"mercilessness\", Swift said: \"In every one of my relationships, I've been good and fair. [...] Chances are if they're being written about in a way they don't like, it’s because they hurt me really badly. [...] I don't think it's mean.\"\n\nIn an interview with Brian Mansfield for USA Today (October 2010), she said that the subject behind \"Dear John\" was an ex-boyfriend of hers, who was also the subject behind \"The Story of Us\", another Speak Now track. Whereas \"The Story of Us\" was inspired by their encounter at an awards show, \"Dear John\" was akin to \"the last e-mail you'd send to somebody you used to be in a relationship with\". The song is track number five on Speak Now, which was released on October 25, 2010, through Big Machine Records. Swift included the song on the set list of her Speak Now World Tour (2011–2012). During the shows, as the song approached its end, fireworks exploded onstage to accompany the lyrics, \"I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town.\" At the June 24, 2023, show in Minneapolis, as part of the Eras Tour (2023–2024), Swift performed \"Dear John\" as a \"surprise song\".\n\nMusic and production \n\"Dear John\" is a slow-burning power ballad produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman. At six minutes and forty three seconds (6:43), it is the longest track on Speak Now. Music critics described the genre as soft rock, electric blues, country, and country pop. They found influences of blues styles such as blues rock, specifically due to the electric guitar licks; Spin Marc Hogan and Slant Magazine Jonathan Keefe attributed the blues elements to a possible influence by musician John Mayer, with Keefe thinking the \"blues-pop\" arrangement was reminiscent of Mayer's 2006 album Continuum. In the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers wrote that Swift's vocals in \"Dear John\" expand considerably compared to those on her previous songs: \"she opens up her throat so wide that she almost yells.\" According to George Lang from The Oklahoman, Dear John' could be a broadside worthy of Polly Jean Harvey.\"\n\nLyrical interpretation \nThe title of \"Dear John\" references the expression \"Dear John letter\", which refers to a letter written to a man by his romantic partner to inform him that their relationship is over. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone summarized the lyrics as a \"dissection of a failed quasi-relationship, with no happy ending, no moral, no solution, not even a lesson learned – just a bad memory filed away\". The narrator is a 19-year-old woman who is manipulated by an older man whose motives she describes as \"dark\" and twisted. She describes the reasons why she became heartbroken, confronts the man (\"Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?\"), recalls their tumultuous relationship (\"You are an expert at sorry/ And keeping lines blurry/ And never impressed by me acing your tests/ All the girls that you've run dry/ Have tired, lifeless eyes/ 'Cause you burned them out\"), and blames herself for their problems (\"I should've known\").\n\nAfter the bridge, she tells him, \"I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town\", declaring her decision to move on. Some critics remarked that this part is the climax. The final line switches from \"I should've known\" to \"You should've known\", holding the man accountable for his wrongdoings. Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant considered the lyrics both a continuation of the \"wistful teenage puppy-love mindset\" of Swift's previous albums and an exploration of more grown-up perspectives. Sociologist and criminologist Laura L. Finley considers the narrator a survivor of sexual abuse when she was too young.\n\nDue to Swift's high-profile, short-lived relationship with singer-songwriter John Mayer, the media surmised that \"Dear John\" might have been inspired by him. In an interview with Rolling Stone (June 2012), Mayer said the song \"humiliated\" him and dismissed it as \"cheap songwriting\". Swift never confirmed nor denied the association, saying in an interview with Glamour (October 2012): \"How presumptuous! I never disclose who my songs are about.\" Musicologist James E. Perone compared \"Dear John\" to John Lennon's \"How Do You Sleep?\" (1971), allegedly about fellow musician Paul McCartney, in how both were open letters directed at another celebrity that affected their personal lives. Sharing the same idea, Chris Willman from Yahoo! wrote that not since the Lennon–McCartney affair \"has a major pop singer-songwriter so publicly and unguardedly taken on another in song\", and he argued that \"Dear John\" was \"braver... and more cutting\" because of its \"vulnerability and woundedness\". Perone and Taffy Brodesser-Akner from The Paris Review commented that the song alludes to many of Mayer's supposedly egoistical and controversial traits; to this extent, the latter considered it a \"master class in passive-aggression\".\n\nCritical reception \nMany critics selected \"Dear John\" as Speak Now best song because of its production and emotional impact. Such critics include Jon Caramanica in The New York Times (lauding the blues production for expanding beyond Swift's country-music comfort zone), Mikael Wood in Spin (saying it was \"epic pop-country poetry\"), and Willman in The Hollywood Reporter (underscoring the \"chills-inducing climax\"). Rolling Stone Brittany Spanos and Vulture Nate Jones highlighted the production's perceived similarities to Mayer's music, and Spanos deemed it superior to any of his work.\n\nSeveral critics also praised the vivid and detail-heavy lyrics—Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer said \"Dear John\" was a sign of Swift's \"growing confidence\" in songwriting. Hogan wrote that this quality, alongside the song's deliberate pace, made \"Dear John\" a \"devastating takedown for the ages\". Meanwhile, Perone thought the track's length is a weak point because it pads the album's runtime. Other critics deemed the lyrics shallow and shortsighted, including The Morning Call John J. Moser (criticizing Swift as \"a bitter brat swimming in self pity\"), Fort Worth Star-Telegram Preston Jones (labelling the song \"self-indulgent\"), and Keefe (deeming it self-righteous). A few agreed the confrontational nature of the lyrics makes the song jarring or uncomfortable to listen to but were nevertheless positive about the viciousness of its accusations. Billboard ranked \"Dear John\" at number 18 on its list of the \"100 Best Deep Cuts by 21st Century Pop Stars\", and its editor Jason Lipshutz lauded how \"each bruised syllable is essential, every seething accusation methodically rolled out\".\n\nCritics have considered \"Dear John\" one of Swift's best songs. It was ranked among her best 10 tracks by Sheffield (2021), Song (2019), and The Independent Roisin O'Connor (2019). For Sheffield, though the song might sound like a spontaneous vent, \"it takes one devious operator to make a song this intricate feel that way\". Clash (2021) included \"Dear John\" among Swift's top 15 songs—writer Lauren DeHollogne cited how the narrator's naivete makes the song simultaneously excruciating and beautiful to listen to.\n\nCharts\n\nCertification\n\n\"Dear John (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nAfter signing a new contract with Republic Records, Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in November 2020. The decision came after the public 2019 dispute between Swift and talent manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine Records, including the masters of Swift's albums the label had released. By re-recording her catalog, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, including the copyright licensing of her songs, devaluing the Big Machine-owned masters.\n\nA re-recorded version of \"Dear John\", titled \"Dear John (Taylor's Version)\", was released on July 7, 2023, via Republic Records as part of Speak Now (Taylor's Version), Swift's third re-recorded album.\n\nPersonnel \nAdapted from Speak Now (Taylor's Version) digital album inline notes\n\n Taylor Swift – vocals, background vocals, songwriter, producer\n Christopher Rowe – producer, vocal engineer\n David Payne – recording engineer\n Lowell Reynolds – assistant recording engineer, editor\n Derek Garten – engineer, editor, programming\n Serban Ghenea – mixing\n Bryce Bordone – mix engineer\n Randy Merrill – mastering\n Matt Billingslea – drums, percussion, vibraphone\n Amos Heller – bass guitar\n Paul Sidoti – electric guitar\n Mike Meadows – acoustic guitar, Hammond B-3, background vocals\n Max Bernstein – electric guitar, synthesizer\n David Cook – piano\n Dan Burns – synthesizer programming\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\n2010 songs\n2010s ballads\nTaylor Swift songs\nSongs written by Taylor Swift\nSong recordings produced by Taylor Swift\nSong recordings produced by Chris Rowe\nSong recordings produced by Nathan Chapman (record producer)\nBlues songs\nAmerican soft rock songs\nSongs about heartache\nCountry ballads\nPop ballads\nRock ballads\nCountry pop songs", "unikey": "Dear John (Taylor Swift song)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background_and_release", "Music_and_production", "Lyrical_interpretation", "Critical_reception", "Charts", "Certification", "\"Dear_John_(Taylor's_Version)\"", "References"], "contents": ["Taylor Swift began work on her third studio album,Speak Now(2010), two years prior to its release.According to Swift, the album is a collection of songs about the things she had wanted to but could not say to the people she had met in real life.In the liner notes forSpeak Now, Swift explained that every song on the album is an \"open letter\" to someone in her life, \"telling them what I meant to tell them in person\", noting that one song in particular is addressed to \"someone who made my world very dark for a while\".WhenRolling Stonejournalist Brian Hiatt asked about the track's \"mercilessness\", Swift said: \"In every one of my relationships, I've been good and fair.

taylor swift talks about her album speak now her hits mine and speak now and writing her songs october 11 2010 by bill conger taylor swift taylor swift has what a lot of us wish we could geta do over its those moments that pass you by when you wish you had something wise or witty to say but instead greeted the situation with an inadequate response or just a blank smile with a guitar and her songwriting muse to guide her the 20yearold country music sensation is able to relive those occasions and envision in hindsight what could have been spoken thats the concept behind swifts third cd speak now a collection of tunes that will be released on october 25th in life you have a lot of situations that pop up and people that come into your life and sometimes you dont get to tell them what you wish you would have told them swift said this album is my opportunity to do that trackbytrack each song is a different confession to a different person some of the things i wrote about are things everyone saw me go through she added some of the things i wrote about are things nobody ever knew about im beyond excited for you to hear these stories and confessions while swift keeps mum about her personal life in interviews she speaks volumes through her music since the release of fearless in 2008 she has captured her life in song journaling her life in detail through words and melody i like to take a lot of time between albums to work up the next one to see what it is swift explained for me i write everything that i live so youve got to give yourself a little bit of time to live a lot of things so you can write about a lot of things thankfully in the past two years ive experienced a lot of things that ive been dying to write about one story listeners are already hearing is mine the albums first single and her most recent top 10 billboard chart hit about what swift calls her tendency to run from love for me every really direct example of love that ive had in front of me has ended in goodbye and has ended in breakups swift confesses i think ive developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and staying in a relationship this song is about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out because im never ever going to go past hoping that love can work out im always going to be very hopeful and blindly optimistic when it comes to love even if it does seem like its really something that is very hard taylor swift swift has been feeling the love of her fans as they have anxiously awaited her new music they have watched as taylor has been crowned with numerous accolades and honors including the most awarded album in the history of country music the sixtimesplatinum fearless is the only album to ever win the allgenre album of the year grammy along with country album of the year trophies from the grammys country music association academy of country music and american music awards she also is the youngest singer to win entertainer of the year from the country music association swift has sold more than 13 million records had more than 25 million digital downloads soldout concerts and topped the charts several times with shouldve said no love story white horse and you belong with me in the summer fans were treated to a scheduled 13hour meet and greet with the singersongwriter at the 2010 cma music fest and it was at that event that swift felt fans gave her the green light for one of the albums cuts sparks fly so what about sparks fly fans asked swift at the meet and greet is it going to be on the next record that was a comment that i kept getting over and over again i played that song at maybe one or two shows and you guys just jumped on it and really made it something that i had to put on the album because you guys really showed an interest in it thats one of my favorite things about you all is that you really tell me what you like what youre feeling and what youre thinking sometimes the choice isnt that obvious for the wyomissing pa native whenever she begins a new album each song is a keeper at first my favorite thing to do is to make a list of what the album would be as i keep writing even when im in the beginning stages of writing the album and ive got like thee songs on the list swift said i still make a list of what track listing that would be like which one will be one two or three you keep writing more songs all of a sudden you have got a list of 25 songs what i would do is i would keep bumping off songs that i felt i had out written and knock them off the list so that you keep updating the list as you keep writing songs your list gets better and better and better i did that so many times i cant even count then swift turns to some insider advice to guide her through the daunting responsibility of which songs should make the final cut every song that i write is about someone about a certain emotion in picking the songs you have to be pretty aware of who is reacting the best to which of your songs ill play my songs for people in my life people like in my band abigail ill play them for my mom ill play them for people who i really really trust their opinion and i know theyre going to be completely honest if they dont like it because thats just as important as someone saying they like it the ones that would get the best reactions are the ones i would put on the record nathan and i are always talking about how may the best song win it cant be personal it has to be personal when i write it but when it comes to picking them i cant be like but no that ones more special to me i dont get my feelings hurt when it comes to picking which one makes the record and which one doesnt for her latest album swift wrote all the songs herself it just sort of happened that way swift explains like id get my best ideas at 300 am in arkansas and i didnt have a cowriter around so i would just finish it that would happen again in new york and then again in boston and that would happen again in nashville the song that made the cut for the album were songs that i wrote by myself so wish me luck she adds with a laugh being a top tunesmith swift has a special affinity for songwriters and offers this bit of advice know who you are writing the song about and then write a letter to them thats why i listen to music because it says how i feel better than i could and it says what i wish i had said when the moments there swift said be as direct as you possibly can if you need to dial it back later i guess do that if you can in your songwriting be as detailed as possible because for people to relate to it they may not have the same details in their relationship that you had in yours but they can relate in that they had these little details to their relationship too the more honesty the better the more details the better the more direct the better bill conger is a freelance writer for various

brian hiatt october 25 2012 taylor swift performs onstage during the songwriters hall of fame ceremony in new york city on june 17th 2010 larry busaccawireimage for songwriters hall of famegetty this is what it sounds like when taylor swift totally loses it oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god her summer tan is turning ashen her very blue eyes are practically pinwheeling with panic but she didnt do anything that bad just now didnt start a nuclear war or curse on country radio or upload her new album to bittorrent were on a bleak industrial road outside a nashville rehearsal studio one stiflingly hot lateaugust evening with swift behind the wheel of her black toyota suv  which she just backed directly into a parked car shes never learned how to use her suvs builtin gps was messing with yelp and google maps on her iphone instead realized she was going the wrong way started to turn around still clutching the phone and    crunch oh my god she repeats pausing for air she takes another look at the car she hit oh is that my bass player editors picks the 250 greatest guitarists of all time the 500 greatest albums of all time the 50 worst decisions in movie history the 100 best albums of 2023 the moment she crashed she pictured herself being taken away in handcuffs sitting in jail in her blue polkadot shirtdress i have a lot of anxieties that end in me being put into a police car she says ponytail bopping as she shakes her head i am so like rules and not getting into accidents so this is perfect at 22 swift is always waiting for her luck to run out this week her new single the irresistible distinctly uncountry we are never ever getting back together became her first number one hot 100 hit  and for all she knows it could all be downhill from here im always terrified that like somethings going to happen she says and im not going to be able to do this anymore and its gonna all end in one day part of the fear comes from loving this so much and not wanting to lose it watch her segment of mtvs punkd where justin bieber goads swift into setting off fireworks from a waterfront balcony  then makes her think that they started a huge fire on a nearby boat her face betrays the same ohmygodohmygod terror you know i had serious nightmares where id wake up in the middle of the night for like three weeks after that i really thought that was it for me i was thinking justin is 17 so hes going to juvie but im going to biggirl prison  see also ebon mossbachrach shouts out special scene partners taylor swift and olivia colman at critics choice awards taylor swift supports travis kelce in wild card game at arrowhead stadium but shes come to understand that life  even hers  is unpredictable uncontrollable messy the kanye episode helped her to realize nothing is gonna go exactly the way that you plan it to she says just because you make a good plan doesnt mean thats whats gonna happen case in point later that evening swift is driving back from dinner singing along to third eye blinds never let you go which came out when she was nine  when unbelievably we get into another car accident this one is random terrifying and utterly not her fault as swift cruises down a fourlane street what looks like an old corvette blazes out of an intersection and veers into our lane  smacking the drivers side of swifts suv then speeding off they were driving as swift later puts it like they had just robbed a bank ok that was my life flashing before my eyes she says voice trembling what is this day this is some strange alternate reality where things just go wrong a lot that was the second time today im going to have a nervous breakdown her phone rings  its her poor security bro who sounds like hes already had one there is a pond complete with koi fish in the middle of swifts astonishing manycolored nashville condo it sits beneath a wroughtmetal spiral staircase leading to a humansize birdcage that faces floortoceiling windows with a view stretching to the green mountains beyond downtown its the most comfortable place in the world she says of the wooden cage built from a sketch she made its just like pillows and comfiness under the previous owner this was an ultramodern bachelor pad over 18 months of remodeling swift gave the condo a heavy dose of wellfunded ocd whimsy the ceiling is arranged in multiple motifs  billowing curtains here a painted indigo night sky there in one corner under hanging crystalline stars sits a giant bunny made of moss hes wearing a hat its a whole peter pan alice in wonderland structure here she says welcoming me the next morning its what the inside of my brain looks like essentially on the custombuilt walls  some brick some purplewallpapered  are an endless array of photographs in ornate gold frames some with matching goldcursive captions swift with her high school friend abigail complete with lyrics from fifteen in which said friend gave a boy everything she had swift with james taylor swift making that hearthandsymbol thing with buddy selena gomez above the fireplace which is emblazoned with a small heart theres even a photo of the moment kanye stormed her vma stage captioned life is full of little interruptions a phrase thats also in the liner notes of her last album right next to what is presumably the actual award in question under glass the place is immaculate and theres no sign that any other living thing  besides her unusually friendly scottish fold cat meredith named after a favorite greys anatomy character  has been here recently but a gossip item circulating that morning suggests otherwise as the story goes she missed her boyfriend 18yearold conor kennedy  an incoming prepschool senior  so she kidnapped him via private jet flying him to nashville taylor swift a history in photos swift stopped reading her own press after the grammy incident and instituted a selfgoogling ban what did i do dont tell me is it bad she says clutching a paleblue knitted pillow and curling her milelong legs beneath her on a swiveling love seat shes barefoot wearing a vneck white blouse and highwaisted vintagey floral shorts her knees have some fresh white scars on them i fell on rocks on the beach and i fell during volleyball kind of eightyearoldchild injuries when she hears the days gossip her eyes widen under feline makeup she looks faintly nauseated how did i kidnap him you cant kidnap a grown man these are serious accusations now she laughs but shes swiveling furiously in the chair like it might move her away from this topic its an interesting way to spin something into a story she says see this is why i dont read stuff so is conor chained to something upstairs then what god she is aware of another recent rumor that she and kennedy crashed his cousins wedding then flatly refused to leave i have no idea what happened there she says spinning again fidgeting with some chipped nail polish on her index finger i think that story was based on the biggest misunderstanding cause i would never knowingly show up somewhere that i thought i wasnt invited to and i would never want to upstage anybody shes come to grips sort of with the fact that her days of exclusively good press are over i just gotta take it day by day she says i dont think anyone is ever truly viewed as only one thing as only good as only wellbehaved as only respectful in the beginning when there would be a tiny news story about something that wasnt true i thought that meant my fans werent gonna show up to my next concert but now knock on wood  wheres wood i need to knock on wood  i feel like my fans have my back and i have theirs and she knows that she cant always be the good guy its just part of the dynamics of a good story she says everybody is a complicated character its somehow not surprising to learn that swift had her first drink ever on her 21st birthday i knew i couldnt get away with it until then she says the night before sipping a diet coke through a little red straw that matches her lipstick we made it into the restaurant without fuss except for a pigtailed little girl who gaped with ijustsawtheeasterbunny joy i didnt really care to know what i was missing and i knew it was illegal and that my luck would be that id get caught and then you think about all the moms and little girls who would have thought less of me im still not much of a drinker but ill have a glass of wine every once in a while and has she gotten drunk im not gonna talk about that no one wants to picture that it cant be easy living like this gomez recalls going out to dinner with swift when she noticed another patron eavesdropping she got startled that they were listening gomez says and she got nervous and then the person left and she felt awful she was like i hope he didnt leave because of me i hope he doesnt think im mean do you think hes going to tell everyone im mean she cares so much swift has recurring anxiety dreams and predictably enough one of them involves being arrested for something she didnt do i keep trying to tell them that i didnt do anything she says and they wont listen or my voice doesnt work another one is quite vivid ill be in a room with piles of clothes all over the floor and i cant clean it and no matter what they keep piling up and i cant move it freaks me out it makes me wish i could clean it cause i love cleaning but the piles get bigger or theres piles on the ceiling and i dont even know how thats possible she knows what that ones about i think i have a big fear of things spiraling out of control she says out of control and dangerous and reckless and thoughtless scares me because people get hurt when you say control freak and ocd and organized that suggests someone whos cold in nature and im just not like im really open when it comes to letting people in but i just like my house to be neat and i dont like to make big messes that would hurt people    i dont want to let people down or let myself down or have a lot of people that i know i wronged swift has never seen a therapist i just feel very sane she says it takes only a cursory listen to swifts songs  or a visit to tmz  to figure out the one part of her life where she allows messiness to reign the way i look at love is you have to follow it she says and fall hard if you fall hard you have to forget about what everyone else thinks it has to be an usagainsttheworld mentality you have to make it work by prioritizing it and by falling in love really fast without thinking too hard if i think too hard about a relationship ill talk myself out of it and why would she go from dating men in their 30s  john mayer jake gyllenhaal  to her current satprepping guy i have rules for a lot of areas of my life she says love is not going to be one of them before she got together with conor she was publicly touting her interest in the kennedy familys history and had mentioned reading a 960page book called the kennedy women weird she says oh my god i know its like  things happen in my life in coincidental ways that are weird but it does look funny    youre telling me she says she looks comically aghast at the idea of elvis superfan nicolas cage marrying lisa marie presley  he got the ultimate collectible thats not whats happening she practically yells sending her eyes skyward it may also help that a friend did it first ask gomez if swift got the idea from her relationship with bieber whos almost two years younger and her answer is quick and cheerful probably swift has written some of her generations most seductively romantic songs  she may be the worlds leading proponent of kissing in the rain i love the ending of a movie where two people end up together says swift who further explores this theme on a new collaboration with snow patrol preferably if theres rain and an airport or running or a confession of love shes also written breakup tunes that in their own way rival idiot wind for mercilessness dear john 2010s presumed john mayer evisceration may be the most brutal dont you think nineteens too young to be played by your dark twisted games but the new albums trouble comes close you never loved me or her or anyone she sings in every one of my relationships she says ive been good and fair what happens after they take that for granted is not my problem chances are if theyre being written about in a way they dont like its because they hurt me really badly telling a story only works if you have characters in it i dont think its mean i think its mean to hurt someone in a relationship mayer told rolling stone that dear john really humiliated him and accused swift of cheap songwriting when i first try to ask her about that over dinner she literally presses her hands against her ears saying be kind and dont tell me the next day im unkind enough to relay mayers quotes and she turns steely i didnt write his first and last name in the song so thats him taking it on  when he had an album to promote but didnt she use his first name i didnt say anything about the persons identity dear john is a wellknown concept and why not just pick up the phone and tell these guys off directly she looks at me like im insane whats the fun in that shes so tough says gomez sometimes shell tell me like you should be a little mean sometimes  in addition to heavy romcom viewing love actually is her favorite swifts daunting ideal of love comes from her maternal grandparents who were married for 51 years and died a week apart they were still madly in love with each other in their eighties she says there are no mere hookups in swiftland no she says nose wrinkling wheres the romance wheres the magic in that im just not that girl and by the way hackers shouldnt bother with her cellphone theres interesting things on there like text messages she says but you wouldnt find any naked pictures shes uncomfortable discussing a line from her new album  ill do anything you say if you say it with your hands  that seems to break new ground i dont know if im interested in writing about um blatantly sexual things out of the context of how it affects a relationship she says then pauses oh i should just totally say that dan thought of it she adds meaning cowriter dan wilson i could get myself off the hook so quick swift loves the idea of long relationships though shes never really had one it usually lasts four and a half months and then it all just disintegrates then i spend like a year and a half mourning the loss of it eventually she would like to have a lot of kids like minimum four she says my fantasy has always been having a bunch of kids running around i would love to become as dedicated a mom as my mom was which brings her to another recurring nightmare i have a kid and the paparazzi is taking pictures and its scaring my baby and i know that i caused it and i cant figure out how to stop it a few days later swift is sitting in a dressing room in mtvs new york studio wearing a fluffy blue bathrobe and borrowed hotel slippers talking business on her phone her two beauty coordinators are ministering to her wavy hair with a flatiron as she speaks she waves me in midconversation i resent the idea that you can just start a sentence with respectfully and then you can just say whatever you want she says sounding like someone with whom you wouldnt want to negotiate i dont understand how we resolve this  is it him giving points ah ok good call absolutely if he calls me ill tell him that ok cool mmhmm yeah respectfully instead of a manager swift has a management team which she leads herself her parents scott and andrea both have business backgrounds and have been involved in her career from the start i think my earliest memory is my mom would set up an easel in the kitchen when i was three says swift and shed give me finger paints and id paint whatever i wanted and it was always good enough my mom would have conversations with me before i could talk she says so i started talking really early her first word was yellow which had something to do with fellow tall creature big bird the rest is already a familiar story she grew up on a christmastree farm in rural pennsylvania became unaccountably obsessed with shania twain and the dixie chicks started singing and writing songs and by age 14 persuaded her parents to move near nashville they signed to a fledgling label called big machine records founded by a former universal executive named scott borchetta swifts dad a merrill lynch stockbroker was a minor investor in the label which was more of an idea than a company when they signed scott swift owns three percent of big machine borchetta says but i hear people go oh well he funded the whole deal and thats why taylors number one its like please people everybody wants to say well theres a reason yeah there is a reason cause shes great thats the reason as she prepares to release her fourth album red swift is at the very center of pop  more than any other putatively country artist before her thats why mtv is sacrificing valuable teen mom airtime to debut her new video in a live segment tonight but first she has to endure nine or so taped interviews with various network offshoots now in a tight red top and blue pants she displays such ease with a parade of interrogators  and the random little kids who come by for autographs  that its not hard to imagine her running for office someday really i might have to be a college graduate though she says i guess i better start figuring out my platform this ease with gladhanding comes from her father who as borchetta says never meets a stranger you send him into a room and hell walk out and go hey i just met a guy on the board at papa johns true to form when i eventually meet scott swift  an affable silverhaired guy in a brooks brothersy suit and rimless glasses  he immediately goes for common ground sharing tales of a brief stint in journalism taylors maternal grandmother marjorie finlay was a professional opera singer who sang around the world i feel like my karma in life is being in a backstage area or being in front of the house says andrea swift whose mother died around the time taylor was signing her record deal we were in nashville when she passed away and it was a surreal moment because i knew we were doing what she wanted us to do there was a kind of passing of the torch swift is convinced shes an exact mix of her parents personalities  she thinks like her mom but acts like her dad my mom is like all about the worstcase scenario she says my brother and i call her central intelligence andrea if you have a headache she could tell you 15 different things it could be all of which end in emergency room or death but she also knows how to throw the best party shes also really compassionate and kind and disciplined and has a really good head on her shoulders for advice her father is the designated dreamer though she wont say if her lyric about a careless mans careful daughter is autobiographical my mom thinks of things in terms of reality and my dad always thinks in terms of daydreams  and how far can we go with this  he was the one who envisioned her success i never really went there in my mind that all of this was possible its just that my dad always did as swift waits for her video debut racing around the room on a wheeled ottoman network executives van toffler and amy doyle show up many smiles and hugs ensue how huge is that single says toffler whos wearing jeans and a blazer his hair slicked back its like the most ginormous thing in history its the highest female debut in itunes history swift says im like what and you know says toffler or i dont know if you do know but youre going to be closing the vmas oh my god says swift im gonna pass out what when were you guys gonna tell me that thank you thats amazing now i really do feel like i might pass out shes happy but theres a familiar hint of terror in her eyes ohmygod a viral video called taylor swift cant believe it shows swift winning award after award acting lotterywinner astonished every time continually mouthing what see kristen wiigs brutal swift impression needless to say swift has never seen it i really get my feelings hurt when people make fun of me she says i never won anything in school or in sports and then all of a sudden i started winning things people always say live in the moment  if you really live in the moment at a big awards show and you win you freak out those are just her mannerisms says one of swifts best friends stylist ashley avignone she does the same thing if i tell her something on the couch at home the morning after the vmas we meet for breakfast in beverly hills  her security sneaks her through the back of the restaurant us weeklys headline for the performance was taylor swift gets sexy  because she wore shorts its a really interesting idea that you wear shorts and all of a sudden its very edgy she says which you know on the bright side gives you room to grow  i dont have to do too much to shock people its 11 am and shes totally brighteyed and unhungover in her creamcolored blouse and polkadot pants not shorts she says that would be too sexy she skipped the afterparties and had sushi with her band instead when she hears that lady gaga tweeted swifty is so cute after her performance she offers a taste of jawdropawards face no way are you serious i need to see that thank you for telling me that she spends three minutes trying again and again to load the tweet on her phone without success it would be easy to watch swift at those awards shows and conclude that shes a phony  in her terms a cheerleading captain pretending she still belongs on the bleachers but if she lacks selfconsciousness thats the idea i just dont want to live that way she says i never want to get jaded because then you get really protective and hard to be around thats what can happen if youre too aware of people secondguessing every move you make so i try to be as blissfully unaware of that as possible she laughs please dont ruin it im living in such a happy little world swift may just experience life a little more intensely than the rest of us which is one reason her songs can hit so hard  along with the ache in her voice and her instinct for the minor fall and the major lift her songs sneak past our emotional defenses because she has so few of them swift has one more thing to do before she leaves la  a performance at a stand up to cancer telethon broadcast live on more than 20 channels she has a bunkerbuster of a song for the occasion called ronan swifts eyes grow wet telling me about it its the true story of a notquitefouryearold boy who died of cancer told from the perspective of his mother swift incorporated ideas from the moms blog giving cosongwriting credit nearly every line is unbearably upsetting  it makes streets of philadelphia sound like party rock anthem the lyric that keeps getting me its about to be halloweenyou could be anything you wanted if you were still here andrea  blond warmeyed  passes out tissues as swift rehearses the song at the shrine auditorium i take one as showtime approaches swift keeps her mind off the song doing her extensive vocal warmups which at one point involve actual meows and discussing food options for tonights plane back to nashville shes sprawled sideways in a directors chair her flats have cartooncat heads by the toes buffalo tenders ok and rigatoni with truffle meat sauce  can i get it with spaghetti though rigatoni makes me feel weird its like a wheel and whats it trying to do its like an unfinished ravioli soon trailed by a small entourage that includes her mom and her stylist swift enters the theaters darkness she stands just offstage biting her lip head down as alicia keys sings in a similar moment before this years grammy performance  which earned her a redemptive standing ovation  swift told herself this is either where you prove the people who like you right or prove the people who hate you right its up to you put on your banjo and go play she unhunches her shoulders breathes deep and walks toward the stage come on baby with me she sings with exquisite tenderness over a hushed guitar were gonna fly away from hereyou were my best four years swift makes it through the song but afterward she breaks into a jog toward her trailer weeping uncontrollably the whole way smudging her eye makeup into wild streaks ten minutes later when i say goodbye she hasnt stopped i was trying not to cry the whole song she says shrugging helplessly some of the events stagehands were watching swift from the sidelines beefy arms folded goateed ankletattooed walletchained they wouldve looked at home wielding pool cues at altamont but theyre soon frozen in place transfixed by taylor swift and by the time shes halfway through ronan i catch one of them silently brushing away a tear this story is from the october 25th 2012 issue of rolling stone taylor swift music music news more news kelly clarkson honors martin

speak now is swifts only album with nary a cowriter in sight is likely no coincidence then producer nathan chapman is still behind the boards but trusted cowriters like liz rose are notably absent while swift came out swinging on her selftitled debut album and entered the history books with fearless speak now was and remains her most complete artistic statement and also the clearest portrait of who swift is and what she cares about in many ways speak now is the last album swift made before the wideeyed gaze shed sing about on red standout all too well began to narrow into a cynical glare take single mean for example while basking in victimhood on reputation lead single look what you made me do has painted swift as vindictive the scrappy banjoled optimism of mean was endearing the track allegedly written in response to criticism from decadesolder music blogger bob lefsetz also finds swift engaging in a rare moment of vulnerability acknowledging shes been knocked off feet and admitting you can take me down with just one single blow rosecolored cuts like sparks fly and enchanted are emblematic of swifts fascination with fairy tales and happy endings but avoid cliché with tactile imagery like the way you move is like a full on rainstorm  and im a house of cards in the former and refreshingly honest relationship snapshots like the forcing laughter faking smiles intro to the latter the power balladry of enchanted is one of several tracks on speak now that find swift venturing outside of the boundaries of country music including the symphonic gothrocker haunted and the paramoreesque the story of us swift would go a little bolder with those experiments on red before eschewing country altogether on 1989 and beyond making speak now something of a bridge between the old taylor and the one we sort of know today a speak now track of particular interest in light of some current swiftcentric events is innocent which she wrote in response to the infamous 2009 kanye west moment at the 2009 mtv vmas while it certainly came across as condescending upon its release its aged particularly poorly by 2017 especially when considered within the current political climate and regarded alongside reputationera jabs at wests tilted stage given the current news cycle even the title speak now reads differently in retrospect as there are plenty of folks dying for taylor swift to do just that  about a number of hotbutton issues on which shes been notably mum a phenomenon that has resulted in among other things a public feud between swifts attorneys and the aclu while speak now does have a couple missteps its also the most complete rendering of goldenage taylor with the kind of earnest introspection and refreshing vulnerability that seem to have been roundly deprioritized in the four tracks released from reputation thus far the old taylor may not be able to come to the phone right now but the voice on the other end of speak now never rang louder or truer get weekly

renaissance a film is a super hero epic in the form of a concert movie well have another round the mad celtic genius of shane macgowan view all posts by rob sheffield october 28 2023 taylor swift the celebrity is such a magnet for attention she can distract from taylor swift the artist but swift was a songwriter before she was a star and shell be a songwriter long after she graduates from that racket its in her music where shes made her mark on history  as a performer recordcrafter guitar hero and allaround pop mastermind with songs that can leave you breathless or with a nasty scar she was soaring on the level of the alltime greats before she was old enough to rent a car with the crafty guile of a carole king and the reckless heart of a paul westerberg  and she hasnt exactly slowed down since then so with all due respect to taylor the myth the icon the redcarpet tabloid staple lets celebrate the real taylor  the songwriter she was born to be lets break it down all 243 tunes counted from the bottom to the top the hits the flops the deep cuts the covers from her raw 2006 debut as a teen country ingenue right up to midnights and 1989 taylors version every fan would compile a different listthats the beauty of it shes got at least 5 or 6 dozen songs that seem to belong in her top ten but theyre not ranked by popularity sales or supposed celebrity quotient  just the level of taylor genius on display from the perspective of a fan who generally does not give a rats nads who the songs are really about all that matters is whether theyre about you and me i guarantee you are a more fascinating human than the twilight guy though im probably not since taylor loves nothing more than causing chaos in our lives shes rerecording her albums including the outtakes she left in the vault before so far shes up to fearless red speak now and 1989for the taylors version remakes both versions count as the same song its a tribute to her fierce creative energy  in the past couple years shes released an avalanche of new music with more on the way god help us all sister tay may be the last true rock star on the planet making brilliant moves or catastrophic gaffes because thats what rock stars do these are the songs that sum up her wit her empathy her flair for emotional excess her girlstothefront bravado her urge to ransack every corner of pop history her determination to turn any chorus into a ridiculous spectacle so lets step back from the image and pay homage to her oneofakind songbook  because the weirdest and most fascinating thing about taylor swift will always be her

with lana del rey although it sounds all the way swiftian vocally lyrically and especially melodically the most beguiling tune on midnights with pizzicato strings and lines about falling for a lover

razzledazzle wordplay no plot no clever twist just her most painfully gorgeous melody massive in its simplicity taylor spends most of labyrinth just sighing uh oh im falling in love over neon synths that flicker and splutter like the circuits are melting down she doesnt lean on poetics here  the word labyrinth appears only once when she sighs lost in the labyrinth of my mind its one of jack antonoffs craftiest productions  loads of brian eno circa another green world every uh oh and oh no hits so hardshe slides into each one from a different angle if youre ever in the mood to forget about taylor the songwriter and just savor her as one of pops most brilliant vocalists labyrinth is one to cherish it takes some nerve for her to use this borgesian title for such a deceptively minimal tune but this is a lavender labyrinth you can get happily lost in a stealth classic image credit christopher polkgetty images image credit beth garrabrant image credit valerie maconafpgetty images one of the stellar aaron dessner collaborations tucked away on the midnights 3 am edition the great war comes clean about the side of taylor who only wants love if its torture going into the question of how emotional battles happen and how to end them especially when you realize youre the one firing the cannons its a dilemma shes written about honestly her whole career from her teen ballad cold as you i start a fight because i need to feel something to afterglow the world war one imagery and martial drums are fitting for a song about how easy it is for two hearts to dig themselves into trenches but the great war also doubles as a tribute to the type of lover who can help rescue you from your own destructive instincts the kind you want on your side image credit larry

feel like writing anymore except shes celebrating the kind of adult passion people assumed wasnt melodramatic enough for her to bother singing about but when she hits those high notes in the chorus its like the sensation at the top of the roller coaster when you realize youre zooming all the way down lover sounds like a sequel to last kiss but with a decades worth more soul going into it she reclaims the cringiest noun in the language and makes it credible for the first time since prince sang i wanna be your lover great video too especially when she goes into sad blue violin pluck mode

traditionalist songwriter she cant sing very well especially in concert where its hard to disguise the thinness of her tone so how is she doing who can tell thousands of little girls are screaming along to every word and i um im one of them its safe to say that taylor swift could outsource her vocals to the audience all night long first verse of hungry heartstyle and these kids would go home feeling like theyd seen a good showmine swift straps on a little red guitar for this number its pretty nifty she is looking and moving with much more confidence than she did on the fearless tour swift is still nobodys idea of a dancer but she compensates with an actress natural sense of stage blocking shes always in the right place at the right time its worth noting that the stage set is better this time out too  last years fantasy castle has been replaced by an apparatus meant to look like the interior of an antebellum mansion this comes complete with a sweeping staircase and a handsome hardwood floor see swift has grown up or at least her fantasies have that said what could be a better fantasy than the one she gets to fulfill every night the one where the words she wrote are sung back to her by everybody in the house prince charming cannot compete with thatstory of us last week the star scrapped a pair of american shows to deal with bronchitis this is about the last thing a professional singer would want especially one who doesnt have the most powerful voice to begin with swift says shes all the way back but im not so sure shes struggling with the low notes and shes having some trouble competing with her band cmon taylor the crowd cant bail you out foreverour song maybe she just needs a folkrock arrangement to sing over swift the multiinstrumentalist busts out what looks like a banjo but its kind of a cheat  its got six strings that makes it a banjitar or a guitar with a banjos body nobody but a real pedant would bother to notice so i guess i stand convictedmean this is the most country song on speak now and swift plays it up  a makeshift porch is wheeled onstage and the band gathers around the star and her banjitar like theyre having a hootenanny in the holler by the hill one of the dancers arrives in a wheelbarrow and another pushed onstage a cow on wheels all of this feels more oklahoma than grand old opry this is country as it is imagined by city slickers on broadway or talented young women from suburban wyomissingback to december accompanied by an early confetti drop its supposed to look like indoor snow which it does not but its still pretty one thing other stars might learn from taylor swift she never takes her eyes off of the audience or when she does its only for effect  she wants to show the crowd shes having an introspective moment it last a few seconds and then her baby blues are right back on you here shes got to play the piano while telling a story and leading a band which is not an easy thing to do this artist is a heck of a communicatorbetter than revenge it is tough to be a woman in taylor swifts world other women are either boyfriendsnatchers or prissy homecoming queens who need to be put in their places on better than revenge which is the most direct homage to paramore on an album with a few of them on it swift threatens a rival with her pen shes confident that the most savage thing she can do to the other woman is write a song about her and perhaps shes right it is that sort of confidence in the power of her artistry that makes taylor swift so appealing also kinda scary she playfights with one of her dancers while shes singing taylor if i wanted a catfight i would have well i dont want a catfight at all this is the low point of the showspeak now see this one is just as mean as better than revenge but swift doesnt pretend to push or slug anybody so its an improvement instead shes executes a dreamgirlsstyle arm dance while shes singing swift is again struggling with her low notes and some of the high notes are missing pitch too i think she needs a breather or a ricola or somethingfearless swift handshakes her way through the crowd to a platform on the floor when she did this last year it took her about five hundred years to hug everybody in sight meanwhile her poor bandmates kept vamping this year she makes it from the stage to the platform in a few measures some teenaged girls go unhugged but the show is crisper for it as good as the fearless concert was this one is running better she does this number on the ukulele id say her playing has gotten better too since this is the song about the dress well actually there are several about dresses ill mention her outfit she wore a purple gown with gold shoes it was a neat ensemblelast kiss damn this is a good song does everybody realize what a good song this is or has swifts massive popularity occluded her talent for those who dont want to believe that a favorite of teenage girls could also be a stellar writer remember that it was the teenage girls who picked up on the beatles first and the stones too it was only later that the obsessors and collectors crowded the teenage girls out im in the mood to say that its the teenage girls who recognize all the good stuff first and tip off guys like me who pontificate about it and drive all the girls out of the room sorry girlsyou belong with me swift kicks this off with a chorus of living on a prayer really its not as horrible as it sounds then its back through the crowd to the main stage where she discharges this one better than she did last year back then it was the opening song in the show and she wasnt sufficiently warmed up yetdear john when she sings the part about fireworks in the final verse actual fireworks go off this makes prudential center smell like sulfur for a little while which clashes with the ballerina onstage but its all worth it for swifts performance she acts her way through the power ballad delivering terrific line readings and accompanying each with an appropriate facial expression her best vocal performance of the night shes really gutting her way through the show and she wins points from me for refusing to wave the white flagenchanted rats no adam young i was half hoping hed pop up to give swift a kiss or something ive got my copy of the liner notes to speak now and i have decoded the secret message inserted into the printed lyrics i know this song is dedicated to adam and she doesnt mean adam lazzara i hope that guy has enough women to contend with swift is not having the easiest time with the high notes here and im beginning to worry that she emptied the tank on dear john she could use a little autotune adam young might have helped out with thathaunted stuck in the death spot on speak now  three songs from the end of a very long album nevertheless its a good one an upbeat rocker that sounds like tori amos at her most conventional giant bells emerge from trap doors in the stage and swift strikes them with mallets as she sings its very nine inch nailslong live i love this song its sort of a countrypop version of i gotta feeling by the black eyed peas only with much better lyrics i have said it before and ill say it again it is telling that the most sincere and passionate love song on speak now is the one swift wrote for her band theres a moment in the second verse where swift sings this is absurd and one of her backing vocalists playing the role of a hater or a doubter or just somebody bad screams the line in a voice redolent of authority its very roger watersfifteen just the star and her guitar at first seated on a sofa if you didnt know who taylor swift was and you heard her sing this song in a coffee shop you would not necessarily think that she was much different from any other guitarslinger you might encounter on an acoustic night if you listened closely you might realize that it was a heck of a narrative with changes of perspective and a thoughtful trajectory but who in the ipod shuffle era listens closely id like to thank the person responsible for picking swift out of the grabbag of aspiring countryfolk artists whoever it was who recognized that she had the charisma necessary to transcend her limitations and communicate to a mass audience must have a terrific eye and a better ear we owe that person plenty of course we owe swift herself a hundred times more but weve been over that the final verse gave me the rock chills you know when abigail makes that mistake and gets her heart brokenlove story i always hate it when the artist gets in the apparatus suspended by wires over the crowd it happens at most arena shows and i always have the same reaction what if the wires snap the spectacle is never worth the anxiety i had extra special levels of anxiety during the final encore because if there is one artist i do not want to see fall to her death in the middle of the prudential center that artist is taylor swift i dont think i could handle that sure enough no sooner is swift up and over the crowd than the cradle begins to rock steely pop warrior she is she only looks terrified for a splitsecond she puts her hand on the rail of the balcony as if to steady it which is of course impossible because shes thirty feet off the ground the crew gets her out of there quick but at an inopportune time  swift keeps on singing but shes in the pit and running to get onstage for the songs climax im not disappointed i am happy to see that taylor swift is not the sort of woman who is ready to die for her art i wasnt sure about thatlast word despite the nearcatastrophe at the end this was a very good show smoother and better run than last years her occasional vocal struggles notwithstanding it is always a pleasure to stand in the company of taylor swift especially when that company includes thousands of screaming enthusiastic fans her songwriting may be conservative but thats okay innovation isnt her thing at least not yet if she ever wanted to shes got the storytelling and songwriting talent to take chances and land on her feet those who dont like her because she comes from country or because she cant sing as well as susan boyle or because shes blonde and talented well these folks are missing out its 2011 this is her moment in ten years youre going to want to tell yourself that you were there for itif you purchase a product

musical world like pop where the genres very name puts the emphasis on popularity the deep cut is always at risk of being overlooked for the worlds biggest pop stars the hit single is forever paramount with their nonsingles carrying an air of relative unworthiness but as any true pop stan knows the smashes only ever tell half of an artists story the real stuff of cult devotion is found in the album tracks the soundtrack and compilation contributions the bonus tracks  the deep cuts without them the pop star is only the sum total of what the public already knows about them with them they become threedimensional artists worthy of nearworship related billboard expands in asia with launch of billboard korea 11212017 as for pop star thats a little trickier we generally tried to apply our hypersubjective foursong test as in if you were talking to a fan whos casually paid attention to pop music this century would you expect them to know at least four songs this century by or featuring the artist without knowing whether they were actually a fan if so theyre probably in if not theyre most likely out so sorry carly rae fans  not queen of this list of course the word pop itself is pretty open to interpretation and sometimes we just had to ask ourselves would we ever refer to this person as a pop star in conversation thats why drake is on this list for instance but not kendrick lamar you can be forgiven for assuming kill the lights was a cut off spears 2007 albumblackoutrather than its followup 2008s circusthe songs swaggering serpentine synths kissoffs to the paparazzi and partly spokenword chorus could have easily fit among gimme more and piece of me regardless it speaks to the strength ofcircus preceding singles that lights never got its due on radio kevin rutherford 99 backstreet boys climbing the walls never gone 2005 arriving in june 2005never gonewas thebackstreetboys first studio album since 2000 though for the diamondcertified quintet it mustve felt like over a decade the boy band boom was long dead but never gonemanaged to hang with the radio rockfriendly times by embracing a live instrumentsonly policy and loggingone last billboard hot 100 top 20 hit but the albums standout is arguably this immaculate stringlaced postbreakup power ballad skip to235 the fray never pulled off an epic key change like this  chris payne 98 ciara like a surgeon fantasy ride 2008 a plannedbutcanceled single from ciaras third lp its not hard to see why like a surgeon was ultimately deemed unfit for radio the songs lurching beat overstuffed chorus and weird alreminiscent title all seemed a little offkilter for late00s pop that slight discomfort is what makes the song a fan favorite though an assured cici just a little more sinister than usual with the scalpel but still making all the right cuts proving herself the true tactician of the chorus  andrew unterberger 97 the black eyed peas hands up elephunk 2004 there were simply too many hooks onelephunk too many melodies to lodge in your brain for hands up to score an impact on pop radio  though it mightve had better luck on rhythmic or hiphop formats in fact hands up has a stronger kinship with the peas earlier material which is why its probably the best song to openelephunk a meshing of pre and postwhere is the love sensibilities thats not too jarring for older fans also nba live 2004 right  kr 96 pnk leave me alone im lonely im not dead 2006 leave it to pnk to pen a love song with the lyric leave me the fuck alone this pissy expletivefilled confessional about being headoverheels  but still needing space  was billed as a single overseas but never stateside its a shame the annoyedyetaffectionate track is almost laughoutloud funny while carrying more depth than it lets on the aforementioned lyric still concluding with the sigh tomorrow ill be beggin you to come home  tatiana cirisano 95 onerepublic future looks good oh my my 2016 a panoramic acousticfueled edmpoprock anthem that feels like an entire music festival in threeandahalf minutes with an unbridled sense of optimism baked into every strum and stomp and of course into the secondhandreported chorus you are the future and the future looks good fortunate that tedder  co pushed this thing out in october of last year a month later and the irony wouldve been dandelionbitter  au 94 fergie pedestal the dutchess 2006 you hide behind the computer screens so that you dont have to be seen how could a person be so mean fergie prophetically wondered in 2006 as with all things stacy ferguson what makes this dutchess cut soar is its inherent ridiculousness not only do we hear the keyboard clatter of an internet troll in the background but the song inexplicably opens with an interpolation of her billboard hot 100 no 1 london bridgewhich itself is an interpolation of an 18th century nursery rhyme  joe lynch 93 miley cyrus rooting for my baby bangerz deluxe edition 2013 the thing is miley cyrus didnt need to leave hiphop behind to make her rootsy singersongwriter album rooting for my baby cowritten and produced by pharrell williams is a perfectly melancholy livedin and captivating account of a strained relationship with a tearful twang in her voice she sings about getting a beer for her partner while waiting for a difficult moment to pass in a minute itll be over and gone everything can change on a dime miley must understand  ross scarano mendeswon over millions with his acoustic crooning on 2015 debut handwritten but sophomore lp illuminatesaw the then 17yearold channeling a more soulful side of his artistry perhaps most notably so on dont be a fool his heartfelt vocals make the melody beguiling as it sounds like something youd want to slow dance to  but in reality hes breaking a girls heart telling her hes not worth waiting for  taylor weatherby 89 michelle branch you get methe spirit room2001 few adult contemporaryleaning poprock albums of the 2000s start off as effectively as michelle branchs the spirit room on which you get me the albums second track is flanked by top 20 hits everywhere and all you wanted on either side its understandable that branch went with goodbye to you as single three but you get me remains a strikingly consistent slice of midtempo singersongwriter fare with endearing easygoing vocals and lyrics perfect for the high schoolearly college crowd  which is probably why the song soundtracked mtvs threeseason reality show sorority life  kr 88 justin timberlake feat william damn girl futuresexlovesounds 2006 michael jackson is timberlakes primary pop muse but jt gave a hint of what he might sound like if he favored prince instead of jacko on this frisky futuresexlovesounds deep cut from the syncopated drumbeat to the halfsarcastic falsetto timberlake earned the skinny motherfucker with the high voice title for at least five minutes in 2006  j lynch 87 ed sheeran tenerife sea x 2014 ed sheeran proved his penchant for gushy love songs once more with tenerife sea a lush melody with a lyric that compares a lovers eyes to the canary islandsseas the tracks stickysweet musings seem better suited to first dances than the top 40 ultimately fading behind more popwise x singles like dont though worthy of crushing on all the same tc 86 jason derulo feat jennifer lopez  matoma try me everything is 4 2015 on jasonderulos topheavy 2015 album everything is 4 tryme shines on the lps second half recalling lets get it on through its sexy dance floorready groove the song was released as a single outside of the united states but didnt get its deserved attention stateside  with assists from norwegian dj matoma and international superstar jennifer lopez the trophousebeforeitwastired highlight was probably the best collaboration on the set  colin stutz 85 fifth harmony feat missy elliott not that kinda girl 727 2016 putting missy elliott on a track is always a promising start but when its something as sassy and thumping as not thatkindagirl its downright brilliant frankly though missy isnt even the best part of the song the 5h girls confidence glimmers as they declare their suitors no match for them you wanna touch it youll regret it youll see try me and assert that they wont settle for less show me you got something more plus the beats 80s electrofunksizzle makes it a standout in their discography and todays pop landscape altogether  tw 84 nicki minaj girls fall like dominoes pink friday deluxe edition 2010 nicki minaj has long thrived on her bonus tracks specifically with super bass the radiocozying addendum to her 2010 debutpinkfridaythat peaked at no 3 on the hot 100 but its the lesserknown girls fall like dominoes off that same deluxe edition that packed as potent of a punch sampling the big pinks underground altrock hit dominos and housing some of minajs signature playful flows steven j horowitz 83 john mayer stop this train continuum 2006 a quarterlife crisis freakout of disarming tranquility as well as one of considerable immaturity and myopia but man if you havent been there yourself you probably wouldnt be listening to john mayer deep cuts in the first place so scared of getting older im only good at being young so i play the numbers game to find a way to say that life has just begun hear that but as johns own father tells him you gotta let the train keep riding and hope to enjoy the view when you can  and the insistent comforting chug of the backing track nods in agreement  au demilovato has moved away from poprock and into more rbrooted territory but the guitarbased start of her career is worth remembering fondly by her fourth album 2013sdemi she had become an absolute pro at fashioning sixstring hooks around her seismic vocals and while something that were not has a knockout chorus the lyrics  keenly sliding a needy dude with aspirations of romance to the curb  are the star here  j lipshutz 79 usher feat luke steele looking 4 myself looking 4 myself 2012 the title track to thesecret best album by this centurys most underrated male pop star looking 4 myself finds ursh on a journey towardself and the track sounds like it  the strutting drums and striding keys courtesy of empire of the sun synthfuturist luke steele gently propelling usher ever closer to the man he was the songs introspection feels sincere but not overbearing and its infectious midtempo saunter makes it that rarest find from an rb star a song that doesnt work in the club or in the bedroom but remains utterly irresistible  au 78 nsync it makes me ill no strings attached 2000 its hard to top a classic like bye bye bye but fun as that classic is to dance to itmakesmeill is arguably no strings attacheds greatest singalong with its undulating verses  especially on the second half of each verse  and choppy beat its a tale of heartbreak you can imagine how itmakesmefeel to see you with him presented with an attitude both in the groups singing and the feisty pinballing track which makesyou believe theyre ready to kick the other guys ass rather than cry over losing a girl to someone else  tw 77 halsey gasoline badlands deluxe edition 2015 halseys unlikely ascent from cult favorite to legitimate pop star has been largely fueled by a wildly intense fanbase absolutely down to follow her down through her socialmedia scavenger hunts and elaborate lyrical doublemeanings so yeah they take their halsey deep cuts seriously gasoline a slowburning ode to living with mental difference was a deluxeonly cut off her 2015 debutbadlands but still has the sets thirdmost spotify spins from the opening stanza halseys an open book laying out her distress alongside her newfound fame are you insane like me been in pain like me  bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me  just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me  cp 76 selena gomez perfect revival deluxe edition 2015 dont mistake perfect for just another sob song about infidelity gomez takes the theme one step further in this alluring and somewhat risky revival release where shes driven so mad by suspicion that she becomes obsessed with the other woman herself lyrics like i can taste her lipstick its like im kissing her too might have been expected to draw buzz in 2015  too bad the song was tacked on to the album as a bonus track making it easily overlooked next to the similarly mischievous but popreadier hands to myself and good for you  tc 75 kelly clarkson beautiful disaster thankful 2003 buried among the troubles with love and the moments like this on kelly clarksons debut album was this unassuming stunner with gorgeous backing sighs chiming guitars and one of kellys most heartbreaking choruses if i could hold on through the tears and the laughter would it be beautiful or just a beautiful disaster if its exquisite poprock lightness sounds like it wouldve been more at home on 80s radio theres a reason the song was produced and cowritten by matthew wilder who would undoubtedly advise kelly that when it comes to her doomed relationship in this one shes got to keep on moving  au 74 katy perry international smile prism 2013 katy perry had a strong run with 2013sprism landing with hot 100toppers dark horse featuring juicy j and roar while strongfooted offerings like birthday failed to make a markprismwas rife with finely crafted bops including ebullient deep cut international smile a discorooted wouldbe hit given the right push  sjh 73 gwen stefani yummy the sweet escape 2006 its hard to play this percolating neptunesproduced confection and not be reminded of katy perrys recent single bon appetit  the tracks are similarly goofy and delicious the biggest differenceis that while bon appetit was somewhat overexposed as a single drawing extra attention and judgment yummy can be revered as ahumorous trackwedged in the middle of stefanis sophomore solo album  lh 72 lorde 400 lux pure heroine 2013 theres making it in the big city and theres making the most of the suburbs before shegot on her first plane ella yelichoconnor was kicking it amongst the rows of identical houses that lined auckland new zealand turning everyday teenage romance into fizzing precocious electropop take 400luxlounging in hoodies and hooking up in the culdesac take on towering allure pulses can drive from here on the pure heroine aside highlight thanks to the oozing ropes of synth and lordes heady croon  cp 71 rihanna breakin dishes good girl gone bad 2007 third lp good girl gone bad marked the summation of rihannas evolution from hit wonder to fully fledged pop behemoth but while the albums undeniable smashes proved she was here to stay it was vengeful deep cut breakin dishes that pointed to just how dominant shed become the songs hellhathnofury stomp presented a riri without remorse or selfconsciousness actively daring the cops to come get their girl over incendiary synths that threaten to set the whole thing ablaze before she does the word marshmallowws never sounded so deadly  au 70 jonas brothers pushin me away a little bit longer 2008 before one direction dropped a half dozen or more absolute earworms on the general public each and every album jonas brothers were their closest predecessors each album chock full of jingles eager to please the radio disney crowd pushin me away sits among the jonas top examples of this single or otherwise teetering on that edge between poppunk and poprock that helped define the 2000s its fanfavorite status is cemented by its no 16 peak on the hot 100 on digital downloads alone  kr 69 ariana grande piano yours truly 2013 on arianas debut albumyours truly the way and baby i became immediate standouts for 90s nostalgists but the albums sleeper mariah moment came halfway through piano from the plinked opening chords paired with choral whoaohohohs to the upbeat dareyounottosingalong chorus its uncannily similar in sound and structure to mimis always be my baby its also a clever warning to any early listeners who might roll their eyes at grandes taste for dramatic melisma i could write a song on my new piano i could sing about how love is a losing battle not hard she shrugs  rebecca milzoff 68 christina aguilera birds of prey bionic deluxe edition 2010 xtina is known for her booming vocals so its no shocker that this understated synthheavy midtempo cut was designated a bonus track on bionic without her signature vocal acrobatics this quiet soundscape barely registers as an aguilera track but it still stands as one of her most sonically beguiling compositions  pc 67 jennifer lopez walking on sunshine metro remix j to tha lo the remixes 2002 no stranger to the remix jennifer lopez has constructed a career of flipping originals into invigorating second takes that have proven more successful than the source material mark and jeff taylors euphoric spin on the already sugarrushed walking on sunshine emerged as an unshakeable gloria estefan descendant replete with chugging guitars and bleary synths  sjh 66 one direction fireproof four 2014 music fans who dismiss one direction as a cookiecutterpop boy band have simply not heard fireproof the 1d boys and both niall horan and harry styles as solo artists have swum further into the deep end of the fleetwood mac pool since releasing thisfourdeep cut but the way their harmonies yawn build

undeniably soulful pop highlight of his early years  cs 64 lady gaga summerboy the fame 2008 as with her chameleonic idol david bowie lady gaga knows how to put on a musical skin for a song and make you believe shes been doing it for decades such is the case with buoyant synthfunk bop summerboy which finds gaga channeling gwen stefani channeling debbie harry and creating pure pop pleasure in the process  j lynch 63 zedd feat logic  x ambassadors transmission true colors 2015 the buzzing edmelodrama of transmission remains the highwater mark off an album that only broke two minor us hits the selena gomezfeaturing i want you to know and beautiful now featuring jon bellion perhaps it was morebehindits time than ahead of it the driving chorus and sparkling synthled production would feel more

2005 the material girls discography is a gold mine of pop gems that were overlooked for the single treatment and this twinkling confessions on a dance floor track is no exception with airy vocals over a subdued disco beat this song is practically sonic ecstasy fun fact this wasnt madonnas first forbidden love  a slow jam on 1994s bedtime stories has the same name pc 61 pharrell marilyn monroe g i r l 2014 for a guy whod produced countless hits and lent his angelic voice to a lot of them a true solo smash eluded pharrell williams until his most recent album 2014s g i r l he slayed that dragon with the inescapable happy but g i r ls grandiose opener proved he hadnt lost his artistic flair marilynmonroe is a sixminute tour de force of modern funk showcasing pharrells familiar falsetto hooks alongside some welcome non sequiturs a stopthetape fake ending a spokenword interlude from kelly osbourne and the bizarre reimagining of roman catholic saint joan of arc as some sort of sex symbol  cp 60 britney spears freakshow blackout 2007 while theblackoutera is a thing britney spears fans would desperately like to leave in the past theblackoutalbum remains rightly treasuredas the most interesting set of spears career tunes like freakshow rank among her best supporting cuts finding the sweet spot that defines the best britney songs a little edge in the verses that gives way to a supremely danceable chorus hook i still perform freakshowin my vegas show  its one of my favorite songs that was never released as a single spearstold fader in september its so much fun and it gives me the chance to get the audience involved oh yeah  its sassy and i love sassy  trevor anderson 59 mariah carey im that chick emc2 2008 disco mariah only comes around every so often and when received it must be cherished the velvetsmooth groove and sublime xylophonetraced chorus hook of im that chick couldnt have been much further from the grand ballads that made mcs previous album her biggest in a decade so emc2 understandably eschewed it as a single but a decade later you might have trouble naming a second single from this album even as the icecreamlike flavor from chick still lingers on your tongue  au 58 beyoncé smash into you i am sasha fierce 2008 on an album as massive as i am sasha fierce with planetsized ballads like if i were a boy and halo and the internationally hailed bachelorette anthem single ladies put a ring on it a handful of tracks were easily overlooked but the sweeping and symphonic smash into you is one of beyoncés best  for a brief moment of neartotal

collaborate more often the pair who teamed up on two songs fromciaras 2013 selftitled set combine the singers highenergy vocals with the rappers powerful verse for a combination that explodes off the backhalf of the album with feelgood lyrics like ima live life to the fullest ill be speeding like a bullet ill be rolling like a train  ill be dancing in the rain the only conclusion as to why it wasnt pulled as a single was that minaj was already featured on the albums second hit im out  arguably the weaker of the two tracks  xander zellner 56 lil wayne feat drake with you i am not a human

preferred measurements 372742 squeeze all of that into my coupe for the record 24k magic got three singles deep before seemingly calling it a day if it had opted for a fourth chunky wouldve been the

cyrus lighter miley cyrus  her dead petz 2015 amid the glorious mess that is miley cyrus  her dead petz is this starryeyed 80sflavored slow jam produced by mike will madeit even with its fiveandahalf minute run time  not to mention the lack of clear distinction between chorus and verse  the dreamy ethereal melody never overstays its welcome catching miley in a rare gentle loveswept moment with just a teensy smudge of bangerz glitter a standout lyric ive heard we never truly see ourselves  you gotta leave it up to someone else  tc 48 one direction what a feeling made in the am 2015 one directions later material found the boy band veering further into music that dominated radio far before any of its members even existed though those songs rarely found their way onto airwaves shamewhat afeeling could have been a monster adult contemporary hit uniting lovers of breezy fleetwood macesque 70s soft rock and well adoring 1d fans wholl absorb any pop history lessons their boys

writings on the wall 2000 by 2000 destinys child proved they could sell highenergy cuts and put any man in his place in a smooth four minutes no no no  bills bills bills  say my name but could they deliver a sensual slow jam duh with temptation the ladies flip the script and become the teasing adulterers though  spoiler alert  they ultimately remain faithful and while perhaps destiny childs provocative side was too much a gamble at the time for record executives temptation is a natural bridge to later dc hits for the grown and sexy like cater 2 u ta 46 demi lovato dont forget dont forget 2008 its easy to well forgetthat early on in demi lovatos career the pop star released a slew of tracks that erred on the side of poppunk the title track from her debut setdont forgetjogs our memory and reminds us that not only does the singer have neargenerational chops for a pop star but she also rocks out  hard the only downside of the neonbright rager is that it takes over two minutes to get to the drop which equally feels long overdue and so worth the wait  xz 45 alicia keys heartburn the diary of alicia keys 2003 from the moment the cymbals start tapping and the heavy guitar riff kicks in its clear alicia keys is fired up the callandresponse towardthe end of this sophomorealbum highlight is similarly striking as is the playful story being told throughout blending a medical condition with a literal burning fire  one so strong it requires the fire department in stark contrast to the diary of alicia keys bestknown track the idolfriendly megaballad if i aint got you heartburn offers a hardhitting aggressive alternativethat sees keys tap into her lesserheard brash and bluesy roots  lh 44 coldplay green eyes a rush of blood to the head 2003 green eyes is the kind of broad love song thats hard to hate  especially for anyone with the titular ocular shading  as chris martin tells the rest of the band to take five and embraces his inner singersongwriter to praise his partner calling her the rock upon which he stands the beauty is in the simplicity and straightforwardness which perhaps kept it from becoming a singlebut also madeit a superbly sentimental album track  cs 43 kelly clarkson gone breakaway 2004 its hard to resist cheering for clarkson in this fiery breakup number about asserting independence which was somewhat lost alongside its fellow breakway goneer no matter the track has all the ingredients of a clarkson hit from its rocktinged production to rolloffthetongue lyrics and its booming impossibly satisfying chorus theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight clarkson roars just a bridge that i gotta burn  tc 42 christina aguilera red hot kinda love lotus 2012 justiceforbionic doesnt hold weight when considering the commercial plight oflotus an album of actualized pop jams without any of the hits red hot kinda love was the single that should have beensprightly catchy and ceaseless the type of song that made her a dominant presence in pop from the very start sjh 41 adele all i ask 25 2015 even sia has admitted she didnt anticipate the sunshiney reaper originally penned for then scrapped by rihanna would make it onto her 2016 lp this is acting but were glad it did coproduced and cowritten by kanye west the rumbling anthem is a welcome dose of not today attitude  even if it was ultimately overshadowed by its hot 100topping acting neighbor cheap thrills  tc 39 katy perry one of the boys one of the boys 2008 thefountainsofwayneflavored title track to katy perrys first album not counting her christian music foray as katy hudson in 2001 is a far cry fromthecandycoated anthems that would bring her to international fame in 2010 but it proves shes as learned a student of thewarped tour oeuvre as she is of max martins that being said were still waiting to hear you belchthealphabet katy  j lynch 38 drake come thru nothing was the same deluxe edition 2013 watching drake perform come thru at barclays center in 2013 he stepped out of the melodrama of the outros melody to actually explain to the audience in his speaking voice that by you deserve rounds tonight he meant rounds of sex which is another way of saying drake is always peak drake his sex cuts have gotten sleeker  studies show that sending the youtube link to come thru as a u up text will get exponentially more positive results than find your love  but he cant help being a cornball still with 40 behind the boards chopping up the vocals and keeping the lowend round and consistent everybody goes home happy  rs 37 beyoncé blow beyoncé 2013 pink thats the flavor solve the riddle beyoncé challenges at the center of this ode to um skittles no decoder ring necessary here  partition is coming in a few tracks time anyway  but the important thing is that the track sounds like candy both of the childfriendly variety and adultthemed version bey is more preoccupied with with pharrell and timbaland behind the decks seemingly in the mist of the same justifiedera disco acid flashback and ms carter tickling her upper register to coo blowohohhhh its guaranteed to provide a rush of some kind  au 36 calvin harris the rain ready for the weekend 2009 2011 was the year of the saxophone in us pop music punctuated by star turns for the instrument on the edge of glory last friday night midnightcity and more had therain been released then and not on 2009sready for the weekend perhaps the squelching electropop banger mightve found an audience or perhaps not it wasnt until the following year when harris became more of a household name in the states sax aside though its probably the best chromeo song chromeo never wrote  kr 35 rihanna watch n learn talk that talk 2011 education is important and only a fool would disregard prof fenty when class is in session just because cant kiss back doesnt mean you cant kiss that assuming the person on the receiving end of those instructions hasnt expired from the shock of the invitation its a great lesson

bush which took the commander in chief to task on issues like lgbtq rights the no child left behind act and homelessness when asked if she would update the song for the trump era she tweeted a scalding response there arent words for this shameful person pc 33 aaliyah loose rap aaliyah 2001 saying aaliyah came into her own with her third album would erroneously imply she was ever anywhere else still if the preternatural assuredness of her selftitled album didnt stun relative to the rest of her catalog it certainly did compared to turnofthemillennium rb at large in an era where scrubs were getting it from all corners aaliyah highlight loose rap brushed off false male bravado without so much as a hair flip babygirl commenting you could come better than that out of an empathetic desire not so much to keep her own night hasslefree but to save you from embarrassing yourself for once  au perhaps the only reason this song wasnt picked for a single was because of its message being a little too insistent with the guys telling a girl to do exactly what the songs title commands otherwise it has everything that makes a backstreet boys song great a pounding beat intense vocals and an epic finish and in reality the groups just telling a girl that shes better than the guy shes with  and when its coming from bsb who wouldnt want to hear that  tw 29 lady gaga speechless the fame monster 2009 in hindsight speechless is perhaps a better indicator of gagas ultimate musical destiny than say poker face the former offered one of the first strong indicators of gagas aptitude as a traditional pianistsingersongwriter with an advanced sense of music composition while also introducing mother monster as an heir to the grand ballads of queen bowie and elton john gaga notably wrote speechless for her father to finally persuade him to get an openheart surgery showing the artists gift at turning her personal ache into a powerful artistic statement  ta 28 jayz lucifer the black album 2004 buried on the back end of the black album lucifer has endured for jayz as a fan favorite and a concert staple thanks to brilliant max romeo chop and introspective jigga lyric that finds him analyzing his own devilchasing in between kanyes knocking drums and his own dangelo references kanyeezy you did it again you a genius wouldnt be the last time either  au 27 janet jackson luv discipline 2008 when janet jackson says shes in love you best believe shes in luv luv for this discipline almostsingle she feels the emotional crash so acutely she spends most of the song comparing it to a literal car accident with rodney jerkins blaring synths sounding like the police and ambulance sirens collecting around her as she lies in motionless rapture he hit me with his love is all she can comment from her ecstatic daze and no traffic cop would dare interfere  au 26 nsync feat lisa left eye lopes space cowboy yippieyiyay no strings attached 2000 how many other pop boy bands have a song with a guest rap verse not many outside of nsyncs most underappreciated jam spacecowboy  a delightful pop crossover with a singalong chorusfeaturing the late great tlc mc lisa left eye lopes left eyes fastpaced unexpected 25second verse alone may be what prevented the song from becoming the next single fromno strings attached but the track is unlike any other song in nsyncs catalog  xz 25 maroon 5 shiver songs about jane 2002 yes maroon 5 was once an actual rock band fourfifths of the original members came together as karas flowers a weezerindebted outfit that released a rob cavalloproduced debut album for reprise in 1997 when maroon 5 debuted in 2002 withsongs about jane the altrock edge was still faintly intact though their focus shifted to stevie wonder worship libidinous blueeyed soul and generally any sound that led to adam levine taking his shirt off more often lead single harder to breathe was a fine example of this rockfunk hybrid but you havent felt it in full force until you hear shiver where a slithering guitar riff explodes into a steamy backandforth chorus and a soundtrack for levine to wail about a girl he only seems to get along with when the lights are off  cp 24 justin bieber feat kanye west  raekwon runaway love remix never say never the remixes 2011 not like this moonbounce of a justin bieber deep cut even totally needed a new edit with verses from kanye and raekwon   it was still a total blast even when the bieb was doing his intergalactic strutting solo but man when youve got cameos from two of hiphops greats at their uncharacteristic jiggiest bragging about their ihoplike stacks and rhyming accoutrements with grey poupon youve got a onceinalifetime gem worthy of a more dignified fate than bside placement on a remix ep best part of course is ye shouting out one of the chefs signature dishes no question we the reason why the summers blazing they say you looking good fly colored asian  au 23 ariana grande be my baby my everything 2014 if anything ariana grande has excelled where shes experimented most  some of her most fruitful productions have derived from when shes encroached on the margins thats proven particularly true with frequent producer cashmere cat who enlisted her for his singles adore and quit and mans the boards on aris own my everything sleeper be my baby a dip into electronic pop with little bombast and subtly quaking textures sjh 22 avril lavigne anything but ordinary let go 2002 its hard to come by a poprock debut album more satisfying and complete than avril lavignes let go with angsty singles like complicated and ofthetimesbuttimeless grungepop love song sk8er boi the 2002 lp set lavigne up for a long career to come while a handful if not all of the lesserpraised tracks off

4 deluxe edition 2011 its remarkable to think how comfortable beyoncé sounds in new contexts and4 her lessthanrapturously received 2011 lp was full of such firsttime ventures schoolin life came as a bonus on the release and it showed a selfactualized side of the superstar in full nostalgia mode the 80sesque track took a stroll down memory lane doting on the days where she first noticed boys and got her first pair of heels its humanizing and centering all while reinforcing why shes one of the strongest forces in music today  sjh 19 gwen stefani bubble pop electric love angel music baby 2004 the aptly named bubblepopelectric sounds like a rapid boil of electro blips perpetually threatening to spill over and burn you that musical heat comes courtesy of johnny vulture who also guests on the song and sounds suspiciously similar to andre 3000 but its gwen who turns the boil into an irresistible simmer deftly channeling the campy horny madonna of theim breathlessdick tracyera especially during the cartoonishly sexy singspeak portion  j lynch 18 taylor swift dear john speak now 2010 on 2010sspeaknow a taylor swift album full of rich deep cuts dear john is the one that towers over all of them a searing takedown of a certain older singersongwriter named john that demonstrated the depth of swifts ability few artists can craft a sixminute song with this much clarity and urgency each bruised syllable is essential every seething accusation methodically rolled out like taylor is presenting a legal case against an ex but dear john is not detached  its surgical but full of the betrayal that anyone past a first crush can understand its a perfect song to scream along to with friends or cry along with in solitude  j lipshutz as the first song on kanye wests debut album the college dropout wedontcare might not have been pegged as a single but still served as a feelgood introduction to the promising newcomers first lp the track features classic kanye production sampling the jimmy castor bunchs i just wanna stop to deliver blissful hiphop gospel inspirationally preaching about getting ahead using whatever opportunities youve got cause aint no to tuition for havin no ambition and aint no loans for sittin your ass at home  cs 14 adele right as rain 19 2008 amy winehouse and adeles careers took such dramatically different paths after their debut albums that its easy to forget they were once grouped under the same sort of vh1 you oughta know umbrella but adeles 19 highlight right as rain couldve been right at home on amys back to black in the best way  the songs infectious hammonddriven groove and exhausted selfdefeating chorus make it an obvious analog to black standout tears dry on their own who wants to be right as rain its better when something is wrong adele would be singing a much different tune in two years time but the crackling vitality of this one remains sadly missed  au 13 usher throwback confessions 2004 in 2004ushers smoldering confessions burned through the souls of rb listeners first the babyfaced assassin danced his way into the hearts of fans with his club banger yeah then he slowed the tempo down and delivered his searing single burn which found him drowning in his sinful indiscretions while those records were undeniably potent it was his just blazeproduced dionne warwicksampling heartbreak anthem throwback that was the real livewire with the rocafella producer providing the canvasusherlater tapped jadakiss to paint his regrets over the melancholy track for the official remix shouldve believed her now wishing i could

proper opener that he could never be upright again toggling between rapes murders and worse like an overzealous channelflipper now its too late im triple platinum and tragedies happen in two states he cackled mostly amused at his ability to get us to take him seriously when he couldnt even keep a straight face for the songs threatening chorus cause why in an era with enough reallife monsters there may not be much need for a cartoon one like em but the peerless wit and selfawareness on display here explain why we still pay attention to him through any number of deathly selfserious piano ballads bitch he wrote kill you  au femme fatale britney spears first album of the 2010s came at the right time with the right sound while singles till the world ends and hold it against me approximated the edm droporiented pop music of the moment the buzzing glitching and popping how i roll stood out as antithetical to the rest a precursor to the hypergleam of pc music and a rebuff of the scientifically engineered precision of the day its chaotic and bizarre and remains one of the best songs shes ever made  sjh on his first mixtape the weeknd was consistently direct this music you should be high for it your desires hes got what you need and even though it sounds too bleak and depraved and claustrophobic to be true trust this is fun for him house of balloonsglass table girls runs siouxsie and the banshees happy house through a funhouse mirror and the scene reflected back is warped beyond all recognition the taste in your mouth is chemical and your skin feels different theres coke on every cool transparent surface in the party and youre always going to want more six years later its still true  rs 7 drake feel no ways views 2016 smile the woman who spent her third single seeking discostick ride admission certainly never wanted for extended sexual metaphors so its not surprising that what makes teeth so remarkable isnt its implied carnality take a bite of my bad girl meat but the seething aggression lurking not far below the songs surface not that teeth is a bdsm anthem either its just unequivocal in its demands and gaga told mtv that show me your teeth is just as much a call for speaking honestly and intimately as it is for anything else mouthrelated regardless no pop star since she who we will not compare gaga to had spoken so bluntly about what they wanted  and none had sounded so badass doing the spokenword backing vocal thing either  au 5 rihanna desperado anti 2016  rihanna goes on the lam in this sinister sexy anti vibe about the push and pull of a relationship whether the narrative and its mythlike old monte carlo are literal or metaphorical is up to you and the ability to pull off both is just what makes the song so excellent sure its loose rambling structure and dramatic storyline might not fit the bill of a conventional single but desperado stands out as a brilliantly crafted minidrama unto itself and one that epitomizes the themes of isolation and distrust that define the 2016 album if you listen hard enough one especially heartbreaking lyric sums it up there aint nothing here for me anymore but i dont want to be alone  tc 4 kanye west feat

albumbdayand its standout deep cut freakum dress opening with historys sauciest hamlet reference to be or not to be not and some james brownworthy executive orders bring the beat back  stop i aint ready yet its a relentlessly funky ode to that one outfit you know will always turn headsand using it as revenge against an inattentive partner a blaring new orleans horn section builds this pissedoffgirlsnightout anthem up to an explosive final verse where beyonce spits her secular sermon about paying him back by looking your best  and reminding him its not hard to find a replacement for an album with six singles if were talking the deluxe version its crazy that freakum dress wasnt worked to radio but its also a reminder of beyonces skyhigh standards when it comes to making albums  something thats common knowledge now but was hardly accepted as canon when the breakout star from destinys child was on just her second album with a threeminute album track she introduced a new phrase to our pop culture lexicon previewed a direction shed fully explore a decade down the road and reminded us that when it comes to toptier talent knowing the hits is never enough  you gotta dive into
