Balki, Konkona Sen Sharma, Amit Ravindernath Sharma and Sujoy Ghosh. Co-produced by Ronnie Screwvala of RSVP and Ashi Dua Sara of Flying Unicorn Entertainment, the film has an ensemble cast including Mrunal Thakur, Kumud Mishra, Amruta Subhash, Angad Bedi, Neena Gupta, Kajol, Tamannaah Bhatia,  Tillotama Shome, Vijay Varma and others. It was released on Netflix on 29 June 2023.\n\nPlot\nThe film is a series of four short stories on the topic of love, sex, violence, and relationships.\n\nMade for Each Other \nWhen Veda and Arjun's families meet to discuss their marriage, the conversation revolves around their shared interests and hobbies. Both sets of parents seem to agree that the couple would make a 'perfect match', as they share many hobbies and common interests. Veda's grandmother, who is religious and widowed, walks into the room, and casually enquires if the couple have had sex yet. The other elders are shocked, and Arjun and Veda are left embarrassed. Veda's grandmother insists on the importance of physical intimacy in a relationship, as she believes hobbies can be abandoned and interests change over time. Later that night, she privately narrates to Veda her relationship with her own husband, Veda's grandfather, which was based on mutual attraction for each other, as well as the ability to satisfy the other in bed. Taking cues from this, Veda and Arjun become intimate, often renting private hotel rooms to engage in intercourse. Veda confesses to her grandmother that, though she enjoys the experience, she isn't left feeling fully satisfied. Meanwhile, Veda's parents are chided by Veda's grandmother for having let the spark die out of their own relationship, and forcing the same on to their daughter. One afternoon, Veda and Arjun visit her grandmother, and excitedly proclaim that they have finally understood how to satisfy the other person in bed. Veda's grandmother is pleased to hear this, and open heartedly offers her blessings for their wedding. She even offers to set up her room for them, to use on their wedding night as a honeymoon suite.\n\nThe Mirror \nIshita is a graphic designer, in her early 40s, who lives alone. She suffers from frequent migraines. Her maid, Seema, visits during the day, to clean her apartment. One afternoon, Ishita walks in on Seema having sex with her husband, Kamal, in her bedroom. Too shocked to confront them, Ishita hides while the couple finish and leave. Ishita realizes this is a daily occurrence but is unable to stop it. She also realizes being turned on by watching them have sex. The next day, she secretly starts hiding in her apartment, to spy on them through a mirror and leaves her office daily around 3 pm on the pretence of seeing an acupuncturist for her migraines. One day, Seema spots Ishita in the same mirror and realizes she is being watched. Unable to confront Ishita lest she be fired, but also excited by having someone watch her, she continues and pretends as if nothing has happened.  One afternoon, Ishita accidentally knocks something over, causing a commotion and forcing Seema to confront her. The two hurl accusations at each other and Seema is fired. She struggles to land another job, while Ishita cannot find another maid as rumours about the altercation have spread. At night, Kamal and Seema argue with each other outside their tiny one-room apartment, right where she found and yelled at her daughter for conversing with her boyfriend. Kamal is at first angry with Seema for screaming at her for something trivial in public at odd hours of the night, which then evolved into an argument about her willingly allowing an invasion of their privacy by Ishita but reconciles when he realizes she did so intentionally as a turn on. Some weeks later, Ishita and Seema run into each other while buying groceries. They enquire about the other's wellbeing, and Seema asks if she can come back to work. Ishita agrees, and hands over the keys to her apartment. The next day, Ishita sneaks back into her apartment at 3pm, indicating a return to the old patterns.\n\nSex with the Ex \nA successful CEO of a company, who is married but has a strained relationship with his wife, meets with an accident while driving his old car. Before the accident, he had a video call with his girlfriend, who distracted him and caused him to crash into a tree while trying to avoid hitting a cyclist. Unable to start his car or use his phone, he seeks help from the cyclist and they go to a nearby village. He asks a reluctant mechanic to fix his car, but there is no phone signal available. He goes to a coffee shop and hears a familiar song playing nearby. He follows the sound and finds a woman in a red saree dancing at a community hall. He tries to approach her, but she denies being the person he thinks she is and asks him to leave. A police officer arrives and addresses her by the name he called her, which makes him happy. Inside her house, it is revealed that they were once married, but she disappeared ten years ago. He is thrilled to see her again, but she wants him to leave. They recall their past and have conversations, during which he behaves inappropriately towards her. She repeatedly asks him to go away, but he refuses. They discuss the events leading up to her disappearance, and she suspects that their friend Anu was involved. He reveals that he married Anu and had children with her, becoming the CEO of Anu's father's company. This angers Shanti, who thinks Anu orchestrated her abduction to marry Vijay. They have sex, and while lying together, Shanti mentions the pregnancy test she took before her disappearance. Vijay's response reveals that he manipulated the situation and planned everything to marry Anu. Shanti realises this and confronts him, and he admits to suffocating and killing her with a pillow. In order to escape the arriving policeman, Vijay escapes through a window. Back at his car, he sees people pulling his body out, thinking he is dead because he didn't respond. Shanti appears next to him and tells him he should have returned when he had the chance to which is when he screams.\n\nTilchatta \nSuraj Singh is a wealthy former king in rural Rajasthan, who lives in a palace with his wife and step-son. He is sexually abusive towards, not just his wife, Devyani, but also to young girls in the village. He had married Devyani after lusting for her in a prostitution house, and took in her son too. After he assaults a maid working at the palace, forcing her to quit, Devyani is tasked with a replacement. On a regular weekly call, Devyani's mother, who runs a prostitution house, tells Devyani of a young prostitute contracting \"the disease\" (HIV) through a client. Devyani's mother feels bad for the girl, as her life is ruined at a young age. Meanwhile, Devyani is preparing her 20-year-old son, Ankur, to move to United Kingdom for higher education. Ankur is reluctant to leave his mother alone with his stepfather, but Devyani's long-term plan is to follow Ankur abroad once he settles down. Suraj discourages Ankur in his plans, and also keeps chiding him for his unknown father. Suraj sets his on Rekha, the new maid hired by Devyani to replace the one who quit. Rekha, is young and innocent, and Suraj tries to take advantage of her on the pretext of getting a massage. Ankur walks in at the same time, and Suraj is forced to leave. Meanwhile, Ankur notices Rekha's disheveled appearance as she adjusts her clothing. At night, Devyani is awoken by sounds of pleasure and moaning emanating from a room in the castle. She believes it is Suraj and Rekha, and seems oddly pleased. Unknown to Suraj, Rekha is the former prostitute, hired from Devyani's mother, to work in the castle. Devyani installs her, hoping that she will pass the \"disease\" on to Suraj once he inevitably assaults her. As Devyani walks towards the room to seek confirmation, she is interrupted by the sound of Suraj stumbling into the house. He is drunk and unable to walk, and passes out in the courtyard. Devyani is shocked, and turns with a look of horror at the sounds still emanating from the room. She realizes her plan has horribly backfired, as Rekha is likely having sex with Ankur.\n\nCast\nMade For Each Other (R Balki)\n Mrunal Thakur as Veda M.

Critic Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com reviewed Lust Stories 2 as a diverse anthology that explores lust beyond sexual aspects,gave a rating of 3 out of 5 stars. She praised Konkona Sen Sharma's segment for its intimate storytelling and social context. The segment delves into the primal nature of lust between two characters, portrayed by Tillotama Shome and Amruta Subhash. Verma further discusses Sujoy Ghosh's segment, which explores the encounters of Vijay Varma and Tamannaah Bhatia, delving into the subconscious and guilt. She mentions the fanciful visuals and eerie atmosphere of the segment, which focuses less on explicit representations of sex and more on the toxic nature of lust within an individual. She appreciated the enigmatic and imperfect nature of Amit Ravindernath Sharma's concluding segment, addressing domestic violence and casteism. Verma expressed disappointment in the anthology's lack of queer narratives but acknowledged its potential as a streaming franchise. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV rated the film 3/5 and she described it as a mixed bag of stories and themes. While bursts of passion are present, Chatterjee felt that they are not the main focus. The opening story is criticized for its sterile approach, but Neena Gupta's performance stands out. \"The Mirror\" is highlighted as the turning point, exploring female desire in a complex manner. \"Sex with Ex\" is a genre exercise with the captivating performances of leads, who bring chemistry and intrigue to their roles as a woman who vanished mysteriously and her one-time husband, while \"Tilchatta\" provides a fitting end with Kajol's solid performance. Overall, Chatterjee felt that the show offers a range of narratives, delivering occasional passionate storytelling.\n\nDebiparna Chakraborty from Best of Netflix gave the anthology 2/5 but praised Neena Gupta's role in the first story. She also praised Konkona Sen Sharma's short \"The Mirror\", writing \"With sweat and spit and other bodily fluids oozing, this short drives in the point that sex can be strange and messy, especially when it steps out of the confines of straight-laced monogamous heteronormativity. It no longer remains palatable or clean.\"\n\nShubhra Gupta writing for The Indian Express found Konkona Sen Sharma's segment, \"The Mirror,\" to be the most complex and satisfying. Gupta criticized the lack of passion and avoidance of intimacy in the first episode. The third episode left the reviewer confused about its genre. Gupta praised the performances in the fourth episode but noted the smaller impact of the marquee name, Kajol. Overall, Gupta appreciated the exploration of class and desire in \"The Mirror\" but criticized the lack of representation of marginalized communities in the anthology. The anthology exploring desi sexuality, receives positive feedback from Monika Rawal Kukreja of Hindustan Times. She highlights the engaging nature of anthologies and praises the four filmmakers for their different perspectives on female sexuality. Kukreja particularly enjoys Konkona Sen Sharma's segment and appreciates the performances of Tillotama Shome and Amruta Subhash. While she finds Sujoy Ghosh's segment to be the weakest, she credits Amit Sharma's segment for its twist in the climax. Overall, Kukreja recommends Lust Stories 2 for its brilliant performances and the message it portrays.\n\nSee also \n\n List of Netflix India Originals\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2023 films\n2020s Hindi-language films\nIndian anthology films\nIndian direct-to-video films\n2023 direct-to-video films\n2023 romantic drama films\nHindi-language Netflix original films", "unikey": "Lust Stories 2", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Plot", "Cast", "Music", "Release", "Reception", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["The film is a series of four short stories on the topic of love, sex, violence, and relationships.\n### Made for Each Other\nWhen Veda and Arjun's families meet to discuss theirmarriage, the conversation revolves around their shared interests and hobbies.

plays a middleaged woman who gets pregnant much to the chagrin of her grown sons or a hardcore meditating granny with frayed grey hairthis granny is the highlight of the show with an adventurous past dotted with sexual experimentation with the love of her life this daadi is one for the agesin the highly anticipated sequel to lust stories the four directors r balki konkona sen sharma sujoy ghosh and amit ravindernath sharma take viewers on a journey into the complexities of desire however while the original anthology hit the mark with its explorations of love and libido lust stories 2 falls short with a collection of stories that are more sordid than sensuousr balki kicks off the anthology with a tale of a wouldbe motherinlaw educating her daughterinlawplayed by a giggly and effervescent mrunal thakurabout the importance of not merely being there to serve her son played by angad bedi who acts as the perfect nontoxic nice guythe story takes an unexpected turn when the grandmother poses a provocative question about the couples sexual activities showcasing a refreshing portrayal of an older woman unapologetically embracing her desires neena guptas daadi encourages her granddaughter to take her beau on a test drive before tying the knotbalki skillfully highlights the lack of space desi couples from different generations have had to deal with the urban affluent crowd can rent fancy hotel rooms by the hour but the older generation as many middleclass and poor folks today have had to rely on the darkness of movie theatres secluded riversides isolated fields and sometimes even abandoned makeshift hovels as clandestine meeting spots there is a thrill to the illicit nature of these spaces even nowwho knew watching a grandmother and her granddaughter discuss orgasms codeword mt fuji would be so cathartic balki did and so he crafted the most winsome albeit pg13 short story with a lot of nuanced responsibility at one point daadi breaks the fourth wall and looks directly at us to say sex is important for love and she wants every generation to hear and understand herbut this daadi is no sexcrazed old dummy she knows good sex isnt the endall and beall of a good relationship but a form of intimacy that can keep the playfulness and spark alive in the long run passion is the fuel of life but so is communication and honestybalki gets a cookie for delivering the perfect bitesized modern love story involving generations of indian womenafter the deliciously dark short geeli pucchi wet kiss by neeraj ghaywan from the ajeeb daastaans strange stories series konkona sen sharma is back this time in the directors chair with another unconventional tale with a twisted happyish endingthis one takes the friction caused by lack of space and what it does to couples starved for intimacy and throws us into a world of voyeurs and exhibitionists sen sharmas short gets necessarily weird with its examination of boundarypushing sexual overtures blurring lines of professional ethics unequal power dynamics and consenttillotama shome and amruta subhash play off each other well shrikant yadavs casting is very apt here as wellwith sweat and spit and other bodily fluids oozing this short drives in the point that sex can be strange and messy especially when it steps out of the confines of straightlaced monogamous heteronormativity it no longer remains palatable or clean but doesnt get too deep into the consequences of itthis one will make you uncomfortable but also hot and bothered you cant yuck someones yumno kinkshaming in this housesujoy ghoshs entry leaves too much to be desired the odd lighting and distracting cgi backgrounds may serve a purpose but it is executed poorly vijay varmas vijay chauhan is yet another creep the man has mastered the act at this point after darlings and dahaad but this short isnt itthe sexualisation of shanti tamannaah bhatia for the male gaze is unnecessary and disconcerting and not for the intended reasons ghoshs narrative lacks coherence and also includes the worst sex scene everit is very hastily written and directed you know the feeling when you are writing the final essay on your exam but suddenly you realise time is running out and you rush to finish so the first paragraph ends up reading like shakespeare and the last one is like a muddled whatsapp forward this script is the last paragraph of that essay with a bizarre obsession with big breasts thrown inat least ghoshs bit will have some people lusting no matter how unfeminist that might be of them but the last short completely lost meamit ravindernath sharmas short confuses misogyny abuse and even ambition for lust with the motheaten version of sanjay leela bhansalis aesthetics in tow this tale of lecherous but penniless royals begins and ends with violence while kumud mishra does a great job making your skin crawl even more than the cockroaches and rotting grub kajols casting feels out of place her perfectly straightened hair and chiffon sarees do not help her case eithersharmas short has too many logical loopholes and left me with that many stupid questions before i realised there is just one important one to be asked here
