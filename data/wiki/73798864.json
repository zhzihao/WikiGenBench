{"id": 73798864, "key": "Lady R incident", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady%20R%20incident", "text": "The Lady R incident, also known as #LadyRussiagate, refers to the docking of the sanctioned Russian cargo ship Lady R at Simon's Town Naval Base in South Africa in December 2022 and the resulting diplomatic impact. The ship was carrying military cargo. The incident is controversial for the secretive nature of the docking and an allegation by the United States ambassador to South Africa that South African military supplies were loaded onto the ship for use in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDocking at Simon's Town Naval Base \n\nSometime between 8 pm and 10 pm on Tuesday, 6 December 2022 the Lady R docked at Naval Base in Simon's Town. The ship had turned off its marine tracking system, and its arrival was unexpected and controversial. The ship was loaded and unloaded with cargo under armed guard at night under the cover of darkness, during loadshedding, on 8 December, and departed on Friday, 9 December 2022. The docking was shrouded in secrecy, and neither the South African nor Russian governments commented on it at the time.\n\nThere was significant speculation at the time about whether or not this was an instance of South Africa supplying weapons to Russia in support of its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Two weeks later, following repeated questions about the docking, the Defence and Military Veterans Minister Thandi Modise stated that the Lady R was offloading an old, outstanding order for ammunition.\n\nWitnesses observed that 6 shipping containers were loaded on to Lady-R before midnight on Thursday, 8 December, just before leaving.\n\nThe Lady Rs arrival in South Africa came at a time of heightened tensions between Russia and the West over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and South Africa's unwillingness to criticize the invasion despite its policy of supporting a rules based international order.\n\nLady R leaves Simon's Town Naval Base\n\n2023 accusation by the American ambassador \nOn 11 May 2023, the United States ambassador to South Africa, Reuben Brigety, accused the country of supplying arms to Russia during the December 2022 docking of the Lady R. During the same announcement ambassador Brigety also stated that the African National Congress (ANC), the governing political party of South Africa since 1994, had been unresponsive to repeated American attempts at dialogue and that the ANC's policy document on the war in Ukraine was \"hostile\" to the government of the United States. Ambassador Brigety went on to say that this indicated that South Africa was \"not non-aligned\", contrary to South Africa's officially proclaimed non-aligned position on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. \n\nThe docking of the Lady R, along with other incidents of South Africa-Russia cooperation, further strained South Africa's relationship with the US and other Western countries whilst increasing skepticism in the West of South Africa's self-proclaimed non-aligned or neutral position on the war in Ukraine.  Prior to ambassador Brigety's accusation South Africa had also hosted a naval exercise, Mosi II, with Russia and China that coincided with the one year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and allowed the secretive landing of a US-sanctioned Russian cargo aircraft at the Waterkloof Air Force Base. \n\nRoughly two weeks before ambassador Brigety's accusation South Africa had sent a delegation to Washington, D.C. to advocate for the continuation of the country's inclusion in  African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); during which the American government claims they had raised concerns with the South African delegation about the country arming Russia.\n\nReaction in South Africa \nSouth Africa denied the allegation and stated that the country's interaction with the Lady R was consistent with its non-aligned position on the war in Ukraine. South African President, and President of the ANC, Cyril Ramaphosa stated that an independent inquiry would be launched to investigate Brigety's accusation. South Africa démarched ambassador Brigety and claimed that Bridgety later apologized for the statement. Following the accusation South African Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, stated that US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had informed him in February 2023 of American suspicions that South Africa had supplied arms and ammunition to Russia when the Lady R docked.\n\nFour days after ambassador Brigety's accusation the commander of Russia's ground forces, general Oleg Salyukov, met with the chief of the South African army, lieutenant general Lawrence Mbatha to discuss issues of military cooperation and combat readiness. South Africa denied that the meeting was connected to the diplomatic incident resulting from the Lady R docking and stated that the trip was planned before the Brigety's statement.\n\nAt an ANC political event President Ramaphosa later stated that his government found Brigety's accusation \"distasteful\" and as \"an attack\" on South Africa by not following normal diplomatic processes but stated that the talks with the ambassador there after were cordial.\n\nSouth Africa's largest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, accused the ANC government of secretly supplying weapons to Russia in return for secret funding for the ANC's re-election campaign in the 2024 general election. Stating that unless one considered the possibly of Russian funding for the ANC South Africa's support for Russia in its war against Ukraine \"made no sense.\" South Africa's third largest political party, the Economic Freedom Fighters, rejected the accusation, called for the immediate dismissal of ambassador Brigety, accused the US of spreading propaganda, and stated that if \"guns that were given to Russia [then] it was a good thing.\"  \n\nThe South African civil society group Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) demanded that the South African government publicly share information on what cargo was loaded onto the Lady R and be more transparent about South African arms sales generally. The South African academic and criminologist Guy Lamb asserted that, assuming South Africa acted in accordance with its own laws, it was highly unlikely that South Africa loaded arms or ammunition onto the Lady R. \n\nThe diplomatic incident caused speculation over whether the United States would be continuing South Africa's preferential trade status with the country through the AGOA thereby possibly significantly damaging South Africa's economy. There was also speculation that the incident might also threaten the continued status of PEPFAR in South Africa. The value of the South African Rand declined from R18.8 to the US dollar on 10 May to R19.3 to the dollar by 18 May, a decline that was attributed to the Lady R incident. In May 2023, the South African Minister of Defence and Military Veterans, Thandi Modise insisted \"there was fokol (Afrikaans: nothing) on that ship\". \n\nAt least two South African journalists stated that should the claims be proven to have been false then Ambassador Brigety should be either ousted or punished for making unsubstantiated claims.\n\nReaction in Russia and Ukraine \nRussia responded by stating that their government \"expressed their intention to further intensify mutually beneficial relations\" in a possible attempt to exploit the situation. The Russian government later described ambassador Brigety's accusation as \"totally fabricated and as false\" whilst comparing it to Colin Powell's 2003 presentation to United Nations Security Council falsely accusing Iraq of having WMDs.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded to the incident by stating that he had spoken with President Ramaphosa two days after ambassador Brigety's accusation about \"the peace formula [for the Russia/Ukraine war], about justice, and about how our world should be united by the rules of international law.\" President Zelensky also stated that “anyone who helps the aggressor [Russia] with weapons will be an accomplice with all consequences” in possible reference to the event.\n\nInquiry findings \nIn May 2023 Ramaphosa named a three-person panel to investigate the incident. The South African government published the executive summary of the findings but kept the full report secret arguing that it needed to maintain military security. The inquiry, headed by former judge Phineas Mojapelo,  found that whilst the ship had delivered weapons from Russia to South Africa there was \"no evidence to support the claim that the ship transported weapons from South Africa destined for Russia.\"  \n\nThe inquiry also found that the South African government was unaware that the sanctioned Russian ship was heading to South Africa until it neared South African waters and that it was redirected to Naval Base Simon's Town after the port at Ngqura-Port Elizabeth refused to service the sanctioned ship. The inquiry also noted the role of the United Arab Emirates in facilitating the weapons transaction and that the ship had turned off its identification transponder as it was being tracked by unnamed foreign intelligence agencies. The inquiry concluded that because the US sanctions were not endorsed by the United Nations they were not binding on South Africa.\n\nAccording to journalist Thulani Mpofu, \"A South African government inquiry into whether weapons were loaded onto a Russian ship in December 2022, as claimed by a US diplomat, has established that a European company had in fact been uploading food onto the vessel.\"\n\nBoth the South African and US governments sought to smooth relations following the publication of the inquiry. The US government stated that it appreciated the South African government's interest in investigating the incident but made no comment on the finding of the inquiry. The director of the African Defence Review, Darren Olivier, stated that the inquiry's findings raised \"more questions than it answers\" and that it was unlikely that it would close the issue.\n\nSee also \n\n Russia–South Africa relations\n South Africa–United States relations\n South Africa–Ukraine relations\n Strait of Juan de Fuca laser incident\n\nReferences\n\n2022 controversies\n2023 controversies\n2022 in international relations\n2023 in international relations\n2022 in South Africa\n2023 in South Africa\n2020s in Cape Town\nDecember 2022 events in Africa\nMay 2023 events in Africa\nMaritime incidents in 2022\nDiplomatic incidents\nEvents in Cape Town\nReactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nUnited States and the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nRussia–South Africa relations\nRussia–United States relations\nSouth Africa–United States relations\nSouth Africa–Ukraine relations\nUkraine–United States relations", "unikey": "Lady R incident", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Docking_at_Simon's_Town_Naval_Base", "2023_accusation_by_the_American_ambassador", "Inquiry_findings", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["Sometime between 8 pm and 10 pm on Tuesday, 6 December 2022, theLady Rdocked at theNaval BaseinSimon's Town.The ship had turned off its marine tracking system, and its arrival was unexpected and controversial.The ship was loaded and unloaded with cargo under armed guard at night under the cover of darkness as the country experienced a plannednational rolling blackouton 8 December.The ship left early the next day on Friday, 9 December 2022.The docking was shrouded in secrecy, and neither the South African nor Russian governments commented on it at the time.\nThere was significant speculation at the time about whether or not this was an instance of South Africa supplying weapons to Russian forces in support ofRussia's invasion of Ukraine.

carrying arms which is why democratic alliance da shadow defence and military veterans minister kobus marais asked for an urgent oneonone with defence minister thandi modise in a statement he said the minister has been mum since lady r docked at simons town the vessel should have docked at table bay harbour like other commercial vessels instead it was allowed to dock at simons town naval base which as the largest base in the country is a national key point evidence suggests over the past two nights there was unusual activity in the harbour with shipmounted cranes offloading cargo from the russian commercial vessel onto trucks there was also truck movement transporting containers in and out of the naval base the trucks were protected by armed personnel while trucks transporting containers are not uncommon it is unusual for such activities to take place at night this behaviour had local residents worried because the vessel is under sanction by the us and european union after russia invaded ukraine he said adding given governments history with russia minister modise needs to come clean and explain what is going on and why this commercial vessel was allowed to dock at

email tugs attend to lady r in simons town harbour picture democratic alliance the war of words around lady r and her supposed south african armsweapons cargo generated comment and response from academics civil society politicians and others with probably the most objective coming from the organisation undoing tax abuse outa the randburgheadquartered civil society organisation originally formed to end tolling on certain gauteng highways said south african citizens have a right to know what our government supplies to foreign countries as far as can be ascertained this is the first time outa has involved itself in defence matters there is no need for an enquiry at this stage we want absolute transparency this is not rocket science the authorities need to tell us if anyone in government authorised the loading and supply of whatever it was onto the lady r and if so whether the inventory included armaments andor ammunition outa chief executive wayne duvenage is on record as saying reacting to the demarche minister naledi pandors international relations and cooperation department issued to united states us ambassador in south africa reuben brigety a statement has it the diplomat admitted he crossed the line and apologised unreservedly this after he was summonsed by south africas international relations number one regarding remarks he made about south african weapons allegedly loaded on the russian cargo vessel lady r in simons town in december 2022 after she apparently unloaded russian military equipment ordered by south africa prior to the declaration of the worldwide covid19 pandemic democratic alliance da shadow defence and military veterans minister kobus marais still unanswered by minister thandi modise on the lady r and her cargo in letters and parliamentary questions maintains ramaphosa has to remove modise he has it modises unresponsiveness to my probing questions and desperate requests for clarity make it clear she knew what was going on and has since tried to cover it up  she must go another addition to the lady r comment list was julius malemas economic freedom fighters eff by way of a threepage statement it included a reference to the lady r by way of stating its arrival at naval base nb simons town was consistent with international best practice and that the us has absolutely no right and permission to interfere with south africas sovereign right to determine who she trades with and who her friends are the statement further calls for the immediate dismissal of the us ambassador from south africa for his unbecoming undiplomatic and outrightly irresponsible approach to diplomatic relations there is still no indication from the south african presidency which retired judge will head the lady r enquiry announced last week by ramaphosa or what its terms of reference will encompass the enquiry will allow for facts to be established and for role players to be identified anyone found to have broken the law will face severe consequences the department of international relations and cooperation dirco said on friday according to dirco south africa is known globally for having one of the most stringent processes when selling arms to other countries the process is managed by the national convention arms control committee ncacc which said it has no record of selling any equipment to russia in the last three years similarly denel and rheinmetall denel munition rdm denied selling anything to russia african defence review adr director darren olivier said he does not know for sure whether anything was loaded onto the lady r but as citizens we deserve an explanation for the bizarre secrecy and unusual actions taken around it and proof everything was above board he asked why it was necessary to be so secretive about a shipment of small arms ammunition rounds likely 762mm for the special forces as modise in december said the lady r was in simons town to deliver we know they use that calibre and while a delivery from russia is controversial it wouldve had to be reported as per the arms trade treaty anyway its now clear the us formally raised this issue with south africa months ago in february but government dragged its feet and stonewalled ever since is there any surprise then that it has now blown up into a foreign policy crisis and disaster one more thing when one of your main trading partners confronts you like this and speaks of the loss of preferential trade terms its wise to rush to reassure them if china accused us of selling arms to taiwan with whom china insisted we cut ties do you think wed ignore it olivier asked ramaphosa in his weekly newsletter to the nation reiterated south africas stance that the conflict between russia and the ukraine be resolved through negotiation and peaceful means consistent with our stance on conflicts in other parts of the world south africas view is that the international community needs to work together to urgently achieve a cessation of hostilities and prevent further loss of life and displacement of civilians in ukraine it needs to support meaningful dialogue toward a lasting peace which ensures the security and stability of all nations as a country we are committed to the articles of the united nations un charter including the principle that all members shall settle international disputes by peaceful means we support the principle that members should refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of other states our position seeks to contribute to the creation of conditions that make the achievement of a durable resolution of the conflict possible the reality is the russiaukraine conflict  and the tensions that underlie it  will not be resolved through military means it needs to be resolved politically ramaphosa said tagscyril ramaphosaeffkobus maraislady rreuben brigetyrussiasimons townsouth africathandi modiseuta share facebook twitter
