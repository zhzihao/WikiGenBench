{"id": 74490445, "key": "War in Amhara", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War%20in%20Amhara", "text": "The War in Amhara is an armed conflict in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia that began in April 2023 between the Amhara regional forces along with the Fano militia, and the Ethiopian government. The conflict began after the Ethiopian military raided the Amhara Region to disarm the Amhara Special Forces and other regional allies, which resulted in resistance of local armed forces and a series of protests in Gondar, Kobo, Sekota, Weldiya and other cities on 9 April. \n\nOn 27 April, the head of Amhara's Prosperity Party Girma Yeshitila was assassinated in Menz, North Shewa. The Ethiopian government accused the Eastern faction of the Fano militia for plotting overthrowing the government. The Ethiopian security forces said on 30 April that 47 suspects were arrested by the Ethiopian government in connection with an alleged assassination plot. \n\nThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) stated on 4 May 2023 that militarized situations were present in four towns of the North Gondar, North Wollo and North Shewa zones.\n\nBackground\nThe Amhara regional forces played a crucial role during the Tigray War, fighting alongside the Ethiopian National Defense Force against the TPLF-led Tigray Defense Forces. Amid the Tigray War in early 2021, there was strife in the Oromia Special Zone of the Amhara Region where fighting occurred between the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and Amhara Special Forces. Local witness told that the OLA, along with other ethnic Oromo militants, overwhelmingly took control of Ataye town on 20 March 2021. The OLA was actively allied with the Tigrayan rebels at the time.\n\nThe November 2022 peace agreement which was signed between the Tigrayan and Ethiopian government counterparts opened the door for the OLA insurgency to intensify amidst security and provisional reform in Tigray. As a result, OLA had participated in massacres of ethnic Amharas in the Oromia region. In May 2022, Abiy Ahmed government arrested 4,000 people in Amhara to undermine Fano militia rebellion who were critical to his power.\n\nInitial Fano objectives as of March 2020 was for Benishangul-Gumuz Region's Metekel Zone, the northern districts of Welkait and Raya in Tigray, as well as the southern district of Dera to be placed under the control of the Amhara Region. The military stalemate that preceded the November 2022 peace agreement precluded any land swap in the region, as Ethiopian leaders no longer were interested in supporting Fano's territorial goals. This, coupled with the OLA insurgency in the area, rapidly led to a worsening of relations between Fano and the federal government, which had been ironclad allies just a few years before.\n\nOn 11 September 2022, senior Fano leader Zemene Kase was arrested by the order of Bahir Dar court following an allegation of murder of a police officer. Zemene was used to hiding from authority insight during the government crackdown before his arrest. After thorough investigation, the Bahir Dar prison released Zemene on 3 June 2023.\n\nOutbreak and emergency\nIn early April 2023, federal forces stormed into the Amhara region to disarm regional and paramilitary forces. The local civilians moved to remote areas, as the resistant fighters joined a protest with police forces. On 9 April, large-scale protests were flared up in Gondar, Kobo, Seqota, Weldiya and other cities, including road obstruction and setting tires ablaze to block the incoming Ethiopian Army. The Ethiopian government started to repress opposition media in the region, as well as the killing aid workers by unknown assailants which led the World Food Programme and other NGOs to stop aid operation in that area. Two Catholic Relief Services (CRS) were killed near town Kobo region. According to the Ethiopian Red Cross Society, one of their ambulance was shot by unknown militants in  Central Gondar Zone, injuring a midwife and driver.\n\nOn 4 May, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) reported a series of militarized situations in the area of North Gondar, North Wollo and North Shewa zones in the town of Shewa Robit, Armania, Antsokiyana Gemza and Majete. The Amhara regional government accused the Fano militia's eastern faction for the assassination of the head of Amhara Prosperity Party Girma Yeshitila on 27 April. Subsequently, the Ethiopian security forces arrested 47 suspects allegedly connected to the assassination plot, accusing them for plotting to overthrow the authorities. The public broadcaster EBC stated that the suspect caught in variety weapons and utilities including weapons, bombs and satellite communications equipment.\n\nFano–ENDF clashes \nOn 1 August 2023, clashes erupted between the Fano militia and the ENDF in Debre Tabor and Kobo while ENDF troops attempted to push back Fano from these cities. Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen stated in a rare occasion that security problems in different areas of Amhara region were becoming \"concerning.\" On 2 August, Fano captured Lalibela Airport. Through the public broadcaster EBC, ENDF spokesperson Colonel Getnet Adane threatened to bring the military campaign against Fano if they continued \"disturbing the country's peace\". The Spanish embassy in Ethiopia urged tourists not to leave the city. Heavy clashes were reported around Gondar that same day. On 3 August, Amhara regional governor Yilkal Kefale requested help from the ENDF to quell the clashes.\n\nOn 4 August, the Ethiopian government declared a state of emergency after the Amhara regional government requested federal troops for help. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said that the declaration was necessary as it had become \"difficult to control this outrageous activity based on the regular legal system.\" A curfew and warrantless arrests were introduced and public gatherings were banned. Later it was reported that Gondar, Lalibela and Dessie had fallen under Fano control. On 5 August, Fano militiamen claimed to have captured Merawi and were aiming to encircle Bahir Dar. On the same day, the Ethiopian security forces announced that they arrested ten people connected to \"the security crisis in Amhara\".\n\nThe Director-General of the Information Network Security Agency Temesgen Tiruneh stated on 6 August that irregular Amhara forces captured towns, released prisoners and seized government institutions. On 7 August, the Ethiopian government acknowledged they lost control in some towns and districts in the region. They were able to push back Fano and control Gondar and Lalibela in the following day. A Fano militiaman told to the Reuters that the ENDF was accompanied by anti-riot police and pro-government militiamen. The military advanced their control into six towns and flight resumed.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), in Debre Birhan city, due to heavy fighting in 4 densely populated kebeles between August 6 and 7, 2023, civilians including in a hospital, church, and school as well as residents in their neighborhoods and workers in their workplaces apparently killed due to fragments from heavy artillery or in crossfire. IDPs in Debre Birhan are also at risk of being caught in the crossfires, particularly those in what is commonly known as the China IDPs site near Kebele 8 which hosts close to 13,000 people.\n\nThe EHRC also claims to have received credible reports that in many areas of Bahir Dar civilians were killed on the streets or outside their houses while some youths were specifically targeted for searches and subjected to beatings and killings. There are also credible reports of many civilian casualties and damages to property in various parts of Gondar and extra-judicial killings in Shewa Robit by the security forces, the details of which are yet to be fully investigated and verified. \n\nOn 13 August, the ENDF carried out a drone strike on the town of Finote Selam, killing 26 people according to the hospital source. The following day, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) told they receive reports of strike and shelling in Finote Selam that causes civilian casualties.\n\nOn 3 September, the ENDF captured the town of Majete from Fano. The EEPA reported that the ENDF conducted door-to-door searches in the town and had committed extrajudicial killings against the residents, including the execution of young men. At least 70 civilians were killed in these executions.\n\nOn 24 September, Fano re-entered the city of Gondar and clashed with the ENDF. The ENDF sustained multiple casualties during this engagement.\n\nClashes with Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) \n\nThe conflict spread to the Oromia region and clashes erupted between Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) and Fano since 26 August 2023. On 26 August, clashes erupted between OLA and Fano in Dera. It has been reported that there was heavy fighting between the OLA and Fano militias in the town of Gunde Meskel, Dera district in the North Shewa Zone (Oromia). As the residents of the city told, there has been an exchange of fire between the two forces since 26 August 2023.\n\nHuman rights violations \nThe Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said that many human rights violations have occurred throughout Amhara Region. The EHRC said that the Ethiopian Air Force's airstrikes and drone strikes on Debre Birhan, Finote Selam, and Bure has caused civilian casualties as well as damage to residential and public areas. Reuters reported that a drone strike on the town of Finote Selam left 26 civilians dead and 55 people injured. Civilians in Bahir Dar were reportedly dragged out of their homes and \"killed on the streets or outside their houses while some youths were specifically targeted for searches and subjected to beatings and killings.\" People of Amhara origin in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa were reportedly subjected to widespread arrests by security forces.\n\nThe EHRC also said it had received \"credible reports\" that extrajudicial killings by security forces had taken place in Shewa Robit and that civilian casualties and property damage had occurred in Gondar.\n\nReactions \nThe United States was \"deeply concerned\" about the violence, while Spain and the United Kingdom warned their citizens against travelling to parts of Amhara. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom stated on 7 August that “humanitarian access is difficult due to blockage of roads; communication is difficult due to internet suspension, conflicts have an immediate impact on people’s health and can have grave, long-lasting consequences on health systems. We call for uninterrupted access and protection of health care in Amhara, so [that] WHO and partners can continue our work. Above all, we call for peace.”\n\nOn Twitter, Spain's embassy in Ethiopia warned Spanish tourists not to leave the city.\n\nSee also\n OLA insurgency\n Persecution of Amhara people\n 2023 in Ethiopia\n List of wars: 2003–present\n\nReferences \n\n2023 in Ethiopia\nEthiopian civil conflict (2018–present)\nAmhara Region", "unikey": "War in Amhara", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Outbreak_and_emergency", "Human_rights_violations", "Reactions", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["The Amhara regional forces played a crucial role during theTigray War, fighting alongside theEthiopian National Defense Forceagainst theTPLF-ledTigray Defense Forces.Amid the Tigray War in early 2021, there was strife in theOromia Special Zoneof theAmhara Regionwhere fighting occurred between theOromo Liberation Army(OLA) and Amhara Special Forces.

refused to let that gem of the colored go they dont seem ready to leave that country alone just imagine the inevitable if this spotty faceoff gets out of hand into an all out region wide conflict in previous similar conflict it took place in a region of a much smaller size it is reported that close to a million citizens had perished in a region of less than 65 million people the population in amhara region is close to 30 milliontake the casualty of a million in a region with 65 million people and extrapolate that in a region of close to 30 million that is not something i want to dwell on it for those of you who get high fanning the flames of war from your comfy homes here among our diaspora dont think this is a laughing matter it is not funny okay you must be ashamed of yourselvesthere is another one that has been raging in the western part of oromia that has not been getting the attention of the west and its media that one worries me even more even though we hear a lot of exaggerated feats of socalled ola what im getting from my relatives is the group is not a cohesive one by one estimate there are at least 8 factions of armed vagabonds roaming that region each has its own sub leaders and operation style some of them are outright robbers and at will murderers their main source of revenue is ransom they are remunerated by those they kidnap they are now confined in rural areas where law enforcement is thin but it is a matter of time before they barge into large towns and cities then you will see the two backbones of the country amhara and oromia
