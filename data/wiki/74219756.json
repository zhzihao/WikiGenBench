{"id": 74219756, "key": "Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol%20and%20Other%20Drug%20Treatment%20Court", "text": "The Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court (AODTC) is a specialist court in New Zealand which targets criminal offending driven by alcohol and drug addiction. There are three such specialised courts, in Auckland, Waitākere and Hamilton. Their purpose is to reduce the use of imprisonment by offering offenders with addictions the opportunity to attend treatment in the community. To be admitted to the AODTC, defendants have to be formally assessed as substance dependent (i.e. they have an addiction) by a qualified clinician, be facing a prison sentence of up to three years, and plead guilty. \n\nThe treatment programme takes up to 18 months. Participants are drug tested up to twice a week and subject to regular judicial monitoring of their progress. If the defendant successfully completes the programme, on graduation they are sentenced to Intensive Supervision in the community, instead of to prison. This enables additional support and drug testing to be provided for up to another two years.\n\nThe Auckland and Waitakere courts were established as a pilot programme in 2012. Judge Lisa Tremewan was appointed to run the Waitakere Court and Judge Ema Aitkin to run the court in Auckland. The pilot was evaluated extensively over the next five years to ascertain how well it was working and made permanent in 2019. In 2021, a new drug court was established in Hamilton. Despite the remarkable success of the AODTC at reducing reoffending, no further funding has been allocated in subsequent Budgets to roll drug courts out nationwide.\n\nBackground \nIn 2009, when the Law Commission was reviewing New Zealand's liquor laws, judges told the Commission that 80% of all crime in New Zealand was committed by individuals with alcohol and drug problems. A study conducted by the Corrections Department found that nearly 90% of offenders were affected by alcohol or drugs in the period leading up to their offence. At a conference in Wellington in 2009, alcohol and drug use was identified, and accepted by the Government, as one of the main drivers of crime in New Zealand. \n\nIn 2010, American drug court judge, Peggy Hora, was invited to New Zealand by  National Party member, Mike Sabin, to run a drug court workshop. Judge Hora subsequently visited New Zealand seven times and became the official international consultant to the courts. In 2011, the Law Commission reviewed New Zealand’s Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, and recommended that specialist drug courts should be established. \n\nJudges Lisa Tremewan and Ema Aitken, who are both passionate about therapeutic jurisprudence, were appointed to run the two AODTC courts in Auckland and Waitakere which opened in 2012.\n\nKey components of the AODTC \n\nThe AODTC is based on a drug court model developed in the United States that combines intensive judicial supervision, mandatory drug testing, sanctions for lapses, and addiction treatment to help defendants whose criminal behavior is driven by their substance use. The model was developed by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), rebranded as All Rise, and is described in What works? The Ten Key Components of Drug Court: Research-based Best Practice.  \n\nThe key components include:\n early identification of eligible offenders \n the integration of addiction treatment into the court and justice system\n provision of a continuum of AOD and other related treatment and rehabilitation services\n a non-adversarial approach towards participants by officers of the court\n ongoing judicial interaction with each drug court participant\n expectation of abstinence with frequent alcohol and drug testing to monitor compliance \n a coordinated strategy that governs responses to participants’ compliance with the court’s requirements\n multi-disciplinary approach including education of court officials (prosecution, defence, police, probation, etc) to promote effective drug court planning, implementation and operations\n developing partnerships among court officials and community-based organisations to generate local support and enhance drug court effectiveness\n\nUnique components \n\nA component unique to New Zealand is the inclusion of  Maori language (te reo) and tikanga in court processes and a Maori kaumatua in court to give support to Maori participants and advice to the judge on cultural issues.\n\nTe Hapori \nThe Court and its participants are supported by a Community Advisory Group known as Te Hapori. This is an organisation of volunteers who advocate, advise and support the court by informing the wider community about its purposes and processes in order to enhance general awareness of the court. From time to time, Te Hapori also does fundraising to support participants in their progress through the 18 month programme. Te Hapori facilitates public graduation ceremonies twice a year at which AODTC graduates are able to speak about their journey through the court and receive pounamu taonga in recognition of their achievement.  This Advisory Group fulfills one of the requirements for effective operation of the AODTC identified in the key components described above.\n\nEntry criteria \nDefendants whose offending is driven by alcohol or drug addiction are assessed by a qualified alcohol and drug clinician. They need to: \n meet the DSMIV criteria for a moderate to severe substance dependence in order to become eligible to participate;\n be facing a prison sentence between six months and three years for their current offending;\n be at moderate to high risk of reoffending using the Corrections Department's RoC*RoI risk assessment tool.\n plead guilty and agree to participate in treatment.\n\nExclusions \nSome defendants will not be eligible, even if they have addictions. This includes: \n defendants who are not likely to be sent to prison for their current offences;\n defendants facing a prison term of more than three years\n defendants who have a history of sexual offending, arson or serious violence;\n defendants who have serious mental health issues (as well as an addiction). However, individuals with moderate mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, PTSD are unlikely to be excluded.\n\nEvaluations\n\nLitmus \nThe two drug courts in Auckland have been assessed, evaluated and reviewed more times, and more thoroughly, than any other intervention designed to reduce reoffending in New Zealand history. The Ministry of Justice contracted Litmus NZ, a social research and evaluation agency, to conduct four evaluations to assess the pilot’s progress in  2014,  2015,  2016 with a final Outcomes Evaluation in 2019.  These reports were primarily qualitative descriptions of the Court’s operations and impact with feedback from justice stakeholders, court participants and family members.\n\nLitmus reported that AODTC graduates reoffended significantly less often, had reduced alcohol and drug consumption, spent less time in prison and had improved health and wellbeing. They also displayed better self-esteem and had increased respect for the judicial system, including the Police.  The final Litmus evaluation (2019) said outcomes were double those achieved in most Australian drug courts and concluded the AODTC is making a “strong positive difference in the lives of graduates who remain in recovery” - and that non-graduates “also experience positive outcomes”.\n\nNZ Academics \nIn 2017, the Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund commissioned independent researchers, Dr Katey Thom from the University of Auckland and Stella Black from the Auckland University of Technology to assess the procedures and effectiveness of the AODTC. Their research, published in the New Zealand Criminal Law Review, found that AODTC participants were 54% less likely to reoffend and 58% less likely to be re-imprisoned in the 12 months following their participation.\n\nUS Drug court experts \nIn 2015, New York Law Professor Michael Perlin, and American drug court researcher, Dr Shannon Carey, came to New Zealand and observed the AODTC in action. Dr Carey filmed the two AODTC judges interacting with participants and said: “I have used the videos in trainings across the United States and internationally as examples of best practices in how treatment judges should interact with participants\". Prof Perlin described procedures in the AODTC as “spectacular” and said the judges “consulted with the court coordinating teams, defendants’ lawyers, police prosecutors, family members, advocates and others in thoughtful, integrative ways that left me agape”.\n\nResults\n\nGraduation rate \nSince the pilot was established, 46% of participants have graduated. This is the same graduation rate achieved by successful drug courts in a National Drug Court Institute study in the United States - and according to the New Zealand Drug Foundation, is six times better than the graduation rate of addicts who attend ‘voluntary’ rehabilitation programmes.\n\nReduced reoffending \nIn order to see how effective the AODTC was at reducing reoffending, the Ministry of Justice tried to match participants in the AODTC with a control group of defendants with similar offending who went through standard District Court procedures. The Ministry found that 12 months after completing treatment in the AODTC, graduates (those who completed treatment) reoffended 86% less than the control group. When drop outs (those who did not complete treatment) were included in the analysis, overall participants still reoffended 45% less than the matched offenders. Independent researcher, Katey Thom found AODTC participants were 54% less likely to reoffend over the same follow up period.\n\nComparison with prison-based drug treatment \nAddiction treatment in prison is offered to offenders by the Corrections Department in Drug Treatment Programmes (DTP). However, reductions in reoffending achieved by prison programmes are minimal. In 2020/21, the DTP reduced reconvictions by only 2.2% and reimprisonment by 0.6% in the 12 months after release. In 2021/22, the figures were 3.15% for reconviction and 0.35% for reimprisonment. The reductions in reoffending and reinprisonment achieved by defendants in the AODTC are substantially greater than defendants who attend addiction treatment in prison.\n\nCost effectiveness compared with prison treatment \nIn their cost benefit analysis (see below), the Ministry of Justice said the cost of treatment in the AODTC was $14.46 million over four years. That’s $3.6 million a year. The cost of addiction treatment in prison is around $5.8 million a year, which the MOJ claims in an Evidence Brief is \"likely to be cheaper than related drug court programmes\". However, this assumption fails to take into account the incarceration costs of $150,000 per prisoner, per year incurred by the taxpayer in addition to the treatment costs.\n\nEvaluation by Ministry of Justice \nAndrew Little was a Labour Party member of Parliament when these evaluations and observations were being done. In 2017, once he became Minister of Justice, he said drug courts would be “rolled out across New Zealand in 2018”. In 2019, he confirmed the first new court would be in Hamilton. But prior to making the pilot permanent, he said he was still “waiting on a report outlining the costs and concrete proof drug courts stop people reoffending.” In response, the Ministry of Justice conducted three different evaluations:\n\nSummary evaluation \nThe first of these was a Summary Evaluation which said “the AODT Court implementation was excellent. The AODT Court contribution to improving the lives of graduates and exited participants is good (for example graduates improving their self-esteem, experiencing better relationships with whānau, improved physical health, connection with work or training, and better connection with cultural and spiritual values, and some maintaining sobriety for up to four years after graduation)\".\n\nQuantitative analysis \nThe QA quantified 17 different data points related to reoffending. In summary, it said said that graduates (participants in the AODTC who completed treatment) had substantially better reoffending outcomes than offenders in the District Court who were sent to prison, and then 'matched' on release. After 12 months, graduates reoffended 86% less than matched offenders; after two years, 58% less. Using a three year follow up period, the graduates reoffending rate was 42% lower than that of the matched offenders. After four years, graduates still reoffended 20% less than the control group. Graduates were also substantially less likely to be sentenced to prison up to four years later.\n\nWhen those who dropped out of treatment were included in the analysis, the reoffending rate of graduates and drop outs combined was 45% less than matched offenders after one year, but only 4% less after four years.\n\nHowever, the Ministry acknowledged significant limitations in the matching process, such that AODTC participants were all assessed by clinicans as having an addiction, whereas only 12% of offenders in the so-called matched group were at ‘serious risk of having an AOD problem’. As a result, AODTC participants all had higher risk profiles for reoffending than matched offenders, but subsequently offended at much lower rates.\n\nCost benefit analysis \nThe Ministry of Justice used the following question to conduct its CBA: \"What are the current operating costs of the pilot per annum compared with the costs per annum that would have arisen if the same cases were processed in the usual way?\" It concluded that the operating costs of the  pilot programme in the AODTC were $14.46m more than the cost of the standard court process per annum, and claimed the AODTC returned $1.33 for every dollar in costs. \n\nHowever, the CBA measured costs in the AODTC from the day participants pleaded guilty, but didn't start measuring costs of matched offenders until they were released from prison up to three years later. This meant that the financial savings or benefits stemming from AODTC participants avoiding prison sentences were not included in the cost comparison. Similarly, the Ministry never actually calculated the costs of operating a standard court, which is another significant limitation in their cost comparison.\n\nGovernment response \n\nOnce Cabinet was presented with the Ministry’s analysis, it seems Andrew Little changed his mind about setting up more drug courts. In March 2020, he issued a media release on the “Future of the Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court.” It said: “the AODT court model is expensive to operate, the cost benefit component of the evaluation shows a cost neutral result leading to a small to moderate positive return on investment”. Cabinet decided that “the AODT court model requires further refinement in process, policy and implementation for it to deliver better outcomes”.\n\nIn 2021, the Government agreed that one more drug court would be established in Hamilton, but no funding has been allocated in subsequent budgets for further drug courts anywhere else. Instead, in 2022, the government allocated $47.4m over four years to fund the growth and realisation of Te Ao Mārama, which is a proposal to \"ensure that barriers to meaningful participation in court are identified and overcome\".\n\nIn 2022, the Justice Sector published a 120 page document titled Imprisonment in New Zealand with a section comparing the effectiveness of prison based rehabilitation programms with community based programs. Even though drug courts are 10 to 12 times more effective at reducing reoffending than prison based treatment, the AODTC is not mentioned in this publication.\n\nReferences \n\nNew Zealand court system\nAlcohol law in New Zealand\nDrugs in New Zealand\nDrug rehabilitation", "unikey": "Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court", "summary": "The Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Court (AODTC) is a specialist court in New Zealand which targets criminal offending driven by alcohol and drug addiction.

thanks to the national judicial college we know more about the retirement life of judge peggy horaand when you are done reading this you may well be exhausted life after the bench hon peggy fulton hora ret if you were to have asked me how i envisioned my retirement i could not have conjured up how fabulous it has been after 21 years on the california bench i retired in 2006 and havent slowed down since some people complain that they are bored by retirement i have no idea what theyre thinking im so busy and engaged that i have no idea how i had time to work editors note life expectancy rates are growing in the united states as most americans are expected to live 788 years according to centers for disease control and prevention but for many judges nationwide laws on mandatory retirement ages have not changed leaving them with more years than ever to explore life and opportunities when their work on the bench is complete more judges are finding themselves with ample time to explore life beyond the bench finding ways to explore a new professional identity alongside new hobbies and interests weve heard from judges who are training animals writing books traveling the world and caring for grandchildren many are consulting traveling teaching or returning to law practices here the hon peggy fulton hora chronicles her experiences as a judicial educator a thinker in residence in australian academic communities a published author and a worldwide traveler i have been a judicial educator for more than 25 years and spent lots of time giving back to the profession while still on the bench i would speak at outofstate conferences speak at california judicial education programs and of course teach at the national judicial college some of that work included international travel a particular passion of mine i became involved with law professors who had founded a field called therapeutic jurisprudence tj1 and wrote a law review article coupling tj and drug treatment courts2 this led to my attendance at the first international conference on therapeutic jurisprudence in winchester england in 1998 i was in israel in 2005 and was chatting with consulate staff when my impending retirement came up they said as soon as the deed was done i must come back and speak to dorit beinish the new president judge of the supreme court of israel and president judges in each division about drug courts my official retirement day feb 29 2006 was spent sipping champagne at the us consulate in jerusalem my trip back to jerusalem to speak with the judges was funded by the state department while there i taught at the institute for advanced judicial studies in neve ilan israel in 2008 the state department also sent me to chile to do onsite technical assistance with their drug courts and the organization of american states brought me to argentina where the first drug court was opened in salta in 2014 the second international tj conference was in perth australia in 2008 where the keynote speaker fell ill and i was substituted in at the last minute how fortuitous that turned out to be as a direct result of that trip i was one of 100 people nominated to become south australias thinker in resident ultimately i was appointed by the premier and spent three months consulting on the justice system i produced a report with my findings and recommendations3 it was an incredible experience and coincidentally the longest id ever been away from home because of my work as thinker in residence i became known in australias national legal community ive taught at the national judicial college of australia keynoted the national drug treatment court conference in melbourne keynoted the community legal centers conference in tasmania

university of tasmania school of law ive been to bermuda three times for training and will present a workshop in september during a pleasure cruise from new york the first time i combined tourism with teaching was on a small ship trip to holland during tulip season i met a tj friend in delft and he whisked me to utrecht where i spoke to raad voor de rechtspraak council for courtjurisdiction the hague my fellow travelers on the tour were blown away by my adventure ive taken seven trips to new zealand helping them set up their alcohol and other drug treatment courts beginning in 2010 when i put on a drug court workshop i became the official international consultant to the courts the courts opened in auckland in 2012 as a five year pilot project and are blooming their maori name is te

back for a big ceremony on march besides all the national and international travel ive published 10 articles since retirement and enjoy writing and research4 last but by no means least retirement has allowed me more time with my family i downsized a big twostory house and now live in a 1056 sq ft condo near my sons i have a tradition of taking my grandchildren on an international adventure when

a woman appearing before the alcohol and drug treatment court at the waitakere district court in west auckland judge lisa tremewan speaks to a woman appearing before the alcohol and drug treatment court at the waitakere district court in west auckland the alcohol and other drug treatment court supports users who want to break their habit its a successful system so why might it be shut down asks paul littlemr j was found asleep at the wheel after crashing into a tree with a halfdrunk bottle of whisky in his laphe is appearing before the alcohol and other drug treatment court supported by a public defence lawyer straight out of one of those highpressure tv legal dramas he got the file the day before at 4pm and hasnt met his client yethe does know mr j has seven driving charges to his name including one for being five times over the limit and driving at more than 40kmh in a school zone around 3pmjudge lisa tremewan postpones any decision until lawyer and client have metunder her steady and focused direction the whole team continue to work their way efficiently through 30something case files before lunchadvertisementadvertise with nzmemr p is 17 and has a massive youth court history his case will need to be adjourned but tremewan does not look happy to learn that he is in a gang called hfc which apparently stands for who f caresspelling she notes is obviously one of the things they want to show they dont care aboutthe court sits once a week in courtroom five of the waitākere district court in henderson judge emma parsons is here today to learn the ropes she is sitting alongside judge tremewan the driving force behind the court  in conjunction with judge emma aitken who runs the sister aodtc at aucklandits worth looking closely at the courts unwieldy name alcohol appropriately comes first because that is the substance that does most harm other drug because they come into it too  but also to emphasise that alcohol is as much a drug as any illegal substance treatment because thats what people get here treatment for their problem and court because it is a real court with real charges and real sentencesadvertisementadvertise with nzmeit also has a significant māori name given to it by longtime supporter sir pita sharples te whare whakapiki wairua meaning the house that uplifts the spirit not something you can accuse many courts of doingpeople who appear here are facing a jail term of fewer than three years for a crime that has come about as a result of their addiction along with other strict entry criteria instead of going to jail they agree to undertake a treatment programme which includes a lot of personal supervision and other rehab measuresits a court of two halves broadly the morning is spent poring over all the information and deciding what to do with those in the programme the afternoon is spent telling them whats going to happenwhere the aodtc differs most obviously from other courts is that it does not work on an adversarial system police lawyers probation officers and the others are working together for a positive outcome everyone going through the court has already admitted their guilt anyway  its one of the criteria for admissionrelated articlesnew zealandpoliticsmoving local voting online will help govt too17 feb 0400 pmnew zealandpoliticsgovernments new progress measures coming next month18 feb 1123 pmnew zealandpoliticsbig budget expectations for drug and addiction treatment services28 may 0700 amtremewan explains its makeup is based on best practice observed overseas we copied research that says a team should comprise an admin person treatment people who are often clinicians themselves preferably with a lived experience of recovery then your police prosecutor your lawyer in new zealand weve added a pou oranga the phrase means healing pillar in this case that is kaumatua rawiri pene  matua ra as hes known in court  who works at both auckland and hendersonof the 453 offenders who have been put through the programme 40 per cent have graduated and 60 per cent of those have not reoffendedtremewan says that even where people do reoffend overseas research shows the type of offending is less seriousthat compares with the 60 per cent of those who go through the traditional court process who reoffend within the same periodif im driving along the road and there is someone coming the other way would i prefer it to be someone whos just served their jail time or would i prefer someone whos been actively working on their addiction issues asks tremewanin other words is the public better off when chronic drink drivers for instance have been punished with jail or when they have been successfully treated to break their addictionbut after seven years of operation this effective model is still seen as an experiment with no guarantee it will continue beyond 2020 why the usual reasons politics and moneyadvertisementadvertise with nzmegraduation dayone person is graduating today having successfully completed her treatment others such as mr j are applying to join the programme there are 50 places in all and today there are 16 applicants in the pipeline for the two positions available the largest group in court is those who are checking in as part of their monitoring they are divided into an a team and a b team and progress through various phases according to how well they are doing some will be hoping to move up a phase those who have reached their sobriety goals get tags to mark their achievementkaumatua rawiri pene the courts pou oranga healing pillar at the alcohol and drug treatment court at the waitakere district court in west aucklandduring the lunch break the furniture is rearranged to a more traditional configuration and there is accommodation for the large number of people who will be here to support their whānau and friends courtroom theatricality is apparent not just in the stage management but in the direction tremewan arranges the order of cases for most effect starting with successes so that those present who may not have done so well will be inspired to greater effortsshe first calls rosas case for all its informality this is still a formal court hearing rosas graduation is actually the precursor to her sentencing tremewan outlines the background to her case  messedup relationships her child taken from her now returned other obstacles along the way her case worker and others who have worked with her pay tribute to her progress her mother is there to thank everyone in this court especially you judge because if youd given her the flick i dont know where shed be today rosas partner was so inspired by her transformation that he also put himself through treatment and now they are both living a clean lifethen comes the sentencing on 17 charges including driving offences drug possession breaches of various court orders in another court her crimes would have earned her a 20month sentence but today she is sentenced to 15 months intensive supervision monitored by the judge which means regular meetings to check she is on the right track she also gets an alcohol interlock order  a device in her car which will disable it if she uses alcohol and she will give back by working in the treatment sectorone of the courts four weighting factors for prioritising applications is māori ethnicity  targeting tangata whenua in an effort to reduce their disproportionate representation in the stats  having dependents such as children public safety and family violencerosa and her familys relief and joy appear to have the desired inspirational effect on everyone else in court shes the courts 176th graduatethe process is really a series of conversations between judge tremewan and those in the programme with input from the rest of the team she seems intimately familiar with all their situations and histories as they come up and able to engage with them in detailfinally mr j his lawyer having met and discussed his case with him gets to go to the next step in his application to go on the programmeadvertisementadvertise with nzmetremewan treats him respectfully and kindly thank you for your application to the court she saystell me in your own words  what you know about the court  what its aboutits about supporting people who have a problem with drugs and alcohol he saystremewan is clear about what is expected of him you have to be honest you are only as sick as your secrets she points out only 50 people get on the programmeperhaps fortunately for him mr j is the only one with an application before her today she says she believes he wants to live a different life and can do the hard work requiredmr j slowly starts to smile as the realisation he is going to get the chance to save his life and family sinks in he is invited by the judge to join the programme and given the aodtc contract to signthis is our deal between you and me she tells him before inviting matua ra to welcome him into the courtadvertisementadvertise with nzmewhen the court was set up explains tremewan the money was found and our sentencing act  very sensibly  allows a judge to give an opportunity for people to undergo treatment and get credit for that it specifically allows a judge to adjourn a case for that to happenbut to extend the aodtc more widely to other areas and to more than the current 100 people will require a political commitment to a lot more funding there have been delays assessing data to confirm that it works tremewan doesnt sound very impressedwere into the fourth round of evaluations she says which have all been positive the last evaluation looked at the first 42 graduates and said there had been a 15 per cent reduction in recidivism as against a match group the interesting thing was the match group didnt have addictionshopefully the current evaluation will compare addicts with addicts look at the bigger picture and provide the numerical proof thats neededits doubly frustrating for tremewan because overseas results in some unlikely locations show that drug courts are successfultheyve got them in every us state including places like texas she says thats because these courts work  they get better outcomes ultimately reduce costs and there are fewer victimsbut more people are listening in new zealand since methamphetamine raised its head and it doesnt care what school you went to its interesting how interested people are in alternative approachesadvertisementadvertise with nzmetheres no denying its an expensive way of dealing with the problemthe minimum time in the court is 12 months and the average is 18 when you think of what it takes for people who spend so long living their life a certain way to change direction it takes time and the model uses things that cost money like paying for case managers to be on your team drug testing is the biggest cost but we also know that overseas the cost of testing came right down once you had economies of scaleand there is a lot of testing with people on the programme being checked five times a fortnight people say they are very expensive says the judge to which i would say the status quo costs a lot of money alreadyalso stopping drugrelated crime offers invisible savings in terms of downstream social costs from dysfunctional families and generational criminal behaviourtremewan and others want the current courts futures assured and other courts established elsewhere it is obvious that the judges await a decision from the governmentthe minister of justice is a fani think theyre excellent in the way they deal with people says andrew littlethey have to turn up every couple of weeks and account for themselves and that makes the differenceadvertisementadvertise with nzmeas for the future he makes encouraging noises one of the challenges the courts have is a lack of services and support for those needing treatment this will hopefully be addressed when we announce what we will do after the inquiry into mental health and addictionthe budget will have some commitments following that and i anticipate a bid in next years budget for further rolling out the courts on the back of new treatment servicesjims storygraduates of the court return regularly to touch base and encourage new participants jim 62 was one of the first graduatesive had cannabis charges and a procuring cocaine charge i have had several assaults on police i had four dics from when i was about 28 through to about 40 i got three dics while awaiting triali was drinking all the time starting in the morning id regularly be outside the bottle shop before 9 oclock when it opened and id be peeking in at the bottles once i start drinking i wont stop until its all gonei think id had enough of it because the first day of the drug court the lawyer said you could end up in jail or you can try to get into this drug court and i thought if you dont give it a go now you never willadvertisementadvertise with nzmethe whole thing about the drug court is that they are actually trying to instil a changeyoure not facing a judge thats purely punitive theyre actually working trying to work with you depending on your own cooperation its like you give respect you will get respect you treat somebody like an arsehole nine times out of the 10 theyre going to be an arsehole backthe night before court when i knew they were going to put the scram on i bought a box of beer thats what my mindset was still likein court they said when was your last usefirst of all i said last weekend and then my mind is like im probably going to be sprung and im being put on this programme of honesty so i said it was last night and the system of monitoring meant i couldnt ever usethree months after i started that i stopped at a pub

publications what information have we sent on request how does corrections manage offenders what key measures describe corrections work how is corrections progressing on their plans risk of reconviction statistical models which predict four types of reoffending 1999 the rocroi measures  explanatory notes the rocroi is a measure of risk currently in use throughout the department of corrections the rocroi measure is in fact a combination of two measures roc equals risk of reconviction while roi equals the risk of imprisonment the asterisk  means multiplied by hence the term rocroi is a measure that means the offenders risk of reconviction multiplied by the offenders risk of imprisonment these measures derive from the mathematical relationship between basic social and demographic variables eg age gender criminal history variables eg age of first offence time free in community since thirteenth birthday seriousness of previous offences length of time between offences and future offending the rocroi has been used because research has shown that even simple risk scales ie a checklist of risk factors invariably outperform the clinical or professional judgements of trained experts and experienced correctional staff when making predictions about future offending the rocroi measure is an expression of the likelihood that a person will be both reconvicted in the future and be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for that offence as a combined measure it is quite possible that any individual may have a very high chance of reoffending say 90 but a very low chance of also being sent to prison for that offence say 10 in that case the actual chance of someone being both reconvicted for an offence and being sent to prison for that offence would be only 9 percent conversely of course it is possible for a person to have a very low chance of offending but a very high chance of receiving a prison term if they do again the combined value expressed by the rocroi measure would result in a low probability of that person being reconvicted and sent to prison if someone has a lengthy history of regular and persistent minor offending their rocroi should indicate them to be at low risk the risk of conviction roc would be high but their risk of being sent to prison would not the department has adopted rocroi as its measure rather than just risk of conviction alone because this gives some indication of serious reoffending the type of offending which corrections is attempting to target under its offender management system description of offender and offending history offenders risk of conviction offenders risk of conviction and risk of imprisonment 094 038 094 088 096 059 099 095 our work before sentencing in the community in prison when
