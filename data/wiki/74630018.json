It is also the sixth edition since the tournament was rebranded from \"UEFA Futsal Cup\" to UEFA Futsal Champions League.\n\nPalma Futsal are the title holders.\n\nAssociation team allocation\nA total of 55 teams from 51 of the 55 UEFA member associations will participate in the 2023–24 UEFA Futsal Champions League. The association ranking based on the UEFA futsal national team coefficients was used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:\nThe top three-ranked associations have two teams qualify.\nThe winners of the 2022–23 UEFA Futsal Champions League qualify automatically and its association can also enter a second team. If the title-holders' association is among the top three-ranked associations, the 4th ranked association is also entitled to enter a second team.\nThe remaining associations have one team qualify.\n\nFor this season, the top three-ranked associations are Portugal, Russia, and Spain. As the title holders are from Spain, the 4th ranked association, Kazakhstan, can enter two teams. After UEFA's decision to exclude Russian clubs from all UEFA competitions due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the right to enter a second team passed to the 5th ranked association, Croatia.\n\nAssociation ranking\nThe UEFA futsal national team coefficients at the end of April 2023, used to determine the number of teams each association was entitled to enter, was as follows.\n\nNotes\nTH – Additional berth for title holders\nNR – No rank (association national team had been inactive on the previous 36 months)\nDNE – Did not enter\n\nDistribution\nFor the 2023–24 UEFA Futsal Champions League, the clubs' entry round was determined by their UEFA futsal club coefficients, which took into account their performance from the previous three seasons.\n\nTeams\nBelow are the participating teams of the 2023–24 UEFA Futsal Champions League (with their ranking among participating teams), grouped by their starting round and path for the main round.\n\nFormat\nThe tournament has a mini-tournament format consisting of three qualifying rounds and the final tournament. The qualifying rounds consisted of the following stages:\nPreliminary round: 32 teams entering this round were divided into eight groups of four teams with the group winners advancing to the next round.\nMain round:\nPath A: 16 teams entering this round were divided into four groups of four teams, with the group winners, runners-up, and third-placed teams advancing to the next round.\nPath B: 7 teams that entered in this round and the 9 teams advancing from the preliminary round were divided into four groups of four teams, with the group winners advancing to the next round.\nElite round: 16 teams advancing from the main round were divided into four groups of four teams, with the group winners qualifying for the final tournament.\nIn each group, teams played against each other in a single round-robin format hosted by one of the participating teams.\n\nThe final tournament is played at a centralized location and consisted of single-legged semi-finals, a third-place play-off, and final. If scores were level at the end of normal time, extra time was played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the scores remained tied.\n\nTiebreakers\nTeams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were tied on points, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied, in the order given, to determine the rankings (see Article 14 Equality of points – mini-tournaments, Regulations of the UEFA Futsal Champions League):\nPoints in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nGoal difference in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nGoals scored in head-to-head matches among the tied teams;\nIf more than two teams were tied, and after applying all head-to-head criteria above, a subset of teams are still tied, all head-to-head criteria above were reapplied exclusively to this subset of teams;\nGoal difference in all group matches;\nGoals scored in all group matches;\nDisciplinary points (direct red card = 3 points; double yellow card = 3 points; single yellow card = 1 point);\nUEFA futsal club coefficients.\n\nIf two teams that have the same number of points and have scored and conceded the same number of goals play their last mini-tournament match against each other and are still equal at the end of that match, their final rankings are determined by a penalty shoot-out provided that no other teams within the group have the same number of points on completion of the mini-tournament. This procedure is only necessary if a ranking of the teams is required to determine the team which qualifies for the next stage.\n\nSchedule\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows (all draws were held at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland).\n\nPreliminary round\nThe draw for the preliminary round was held on 5 July 2023, 14:00 CET.
