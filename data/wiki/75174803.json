Published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux on October 17, 2017, the book includes graphic descriptions of operating theaters and the unclean conditions of hospitals and other facilities at the time. The book was given the 2018 PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award and was shortlisted for both the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize and the 2018 Wolfson History Prize.\n\nContent\nThe book is split into a prologue, eleven chapters, and an epilogue. The prologue discusses a general overview of the time period as an \"age of agony\" that was nearing its end thanks to the emergence of Joseph Lister. Each subsequent chapter covers an ongoing history of Lister's life from childhood onward, with vignettes interspersed with other events and accounts of the medical profession during the time period. The coverage of Lister's life is largely based off of Fitzharris' use of his personal letters and the account they give of his activities and thought processes.\n\nThe historical account's prologue starts in 1846 and the first surgical operation with any form of anesthetic by Robert Liston and how an unconscious patient significantly increased the ability for surgeons to complete their operations and have their patients survive. It then moves to Lister's childhood and his fascination with his father, Joseph Jackson Lister's, work in optics and the development of the microscope. Bringing his father's microscope to university and using it for microscopic examination of tissue, he created new ways to treat surgical wounds in the hopes of reducing post-surgical infections. Other scientists, such as Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and Ignaz Semmelweis, also made breakthroughs in understanding how microorganisms lead to disease. Lister's discovery in 1864 of Louis Pasteur's work on the cause of putrefaction lead to his eventual introduction of antiseptics through the use of carbolic acid sprays. His methodology was criticized by several others in the scientific community, but his 1871 successful treatment of Queen Victoria resulted in the widespread adoption of his antiseptic techniques, which he formally presented at the 1876 International Medical Congress.\n\nCritical reception\nReviewing for NPR, author Genevieve Valentine described the book as \"equal parts a queasy outline of Victorian medicine and a quiet story of a life spent pushing for scientific progress\" and, despite being a niche subject matter, suggested that there is \"something that feels vital in a book about horrors everyone accepted as the costs of doing business, and the importance of persistence in seeing results\". Jennifer Senior in the New York Times critiqued the book as being an \"imperfect first effort, stronger at the beginning than at the end, and a bit workaday when it isn’t freaky\". But she also noted that the story told within is \"one of abiding fascination\" because it involves a concept, doctors cutting open bodies with unclean tools and hands was harming their patients, that is so simple and straightforward that the idea it even had to be thought up is hard to conceive. Conducting a review for The Guardian, Wendy Moore wrote that despite the subject matter being a \"reluctant hero\" that might otherwise lend to a boring history, Fitzharris \"skillfully negotiates this hazard by illuminating the characters and ideas of the time\" alongside an \"eye for morbid detail, visceral imagery and comic potential\" that gives a deeper personality to Lister.\n\nReviews in History'''s Agnes Arnold-Forster saw the book in two lights. On one hand she considered the book a \"compelling read\" that \"skillfully deploys narrative tension\" from chapter to chapter, forming a work that will interest the general public and inform them about this period of history. But on a scholarly front, the book is often overblown in its descriptions of Lister and tends to \"stray towards the sycophantic\", with several of its claims about the medical community at the time and the adoption of germ-based ideas, which were already coming into vogue through the 1850's, being at odds with other modern research by Christopher Lawrence, Michael Brown, and Richard Dixey. Martin Edwards in the British Journal of General Practice wished that some pictures had been included for the grisly descriptions and pointed out that the uncritical history of Lister's life alongside implications of him pre-empting germ theory would be disagreeable to some historians. He nonetheless considered the book \"fun, fascinating, easy to read, and assumes no prior historical knowledge\" for readers that overall \"deserves a place by the bedside of any clinician interested in a glorious pus-and- blood-filled romp\".Publishers Weekly selected The Butchering Art as one of its special picks and top 10 science books of the year, pointing out that Fitzharris' book \"infuses her thoughtful and finely crafted examination of this revolution with the same sense of wonder and compassion Lister himself brought to his patients\". For the Wall Street Journal, John J. Ross referred to the book as a \"formidable achievement--a rousing tale told with brio\" that successfully manages to restore \"this neglected champion of evidence-based medicine to a central place in the history of medicine\". Though he also notes that Fitzharris is \"occasionally fuzzy on clinical matters\", such as describing Hodgkin's lymphoma as rare, and that the book avoids mentioning any of the negative aspects about Lister, such as his sexism toward female medical students. Tilli Tansey in the journal Nature considered the book as \"well researched and written with verve\", along with being a \"fine read full of vivid detail\", though also explained how Fitzharris \"takes some licence with speculative conversations, thoughts and emotions, and a few anachronisms irk\". In Social History of Medicine'', Anne Crowther was highly critical of the book, saying that it \"follows Lister’s career well but is weaker on historical context, succumbing to\npopular history’s search for ‘colour’ at all costs\", including generalizations of history that lead to inaccuracies and misinformation, including false quote attribution and statistical math. This, she added, along with how specialized hospitals and other medical workers are presented from the period as compared to Lister would leave readers with a \"very old-fashioned view of the subject\" that doesn't match up with modern scholarship.\n\nReferences\n\n2017 non-fiction books\nPopular science books\nScience books\nHistory books about medicine\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux books", "unikey": "The Butchering Art", "summary": "The Butchering Art: Joseph Lister's Quest to Transform the Grisly World of Victorian Medicine is a 2017 historical nonfiction book by Lindsey Fitzharris that discusses the evolution of Victorian-era medicine between the 1840s and 1870s, along with how surgeon Joseph Lister revolutionized the practice of surgery to reduce the extremely high death rates of the time period.

joseph lister is perhaps the most famous man in the history of british medicine born in april 1827 he was a surgeon and pioneer of antiseptic operative practice president of the royal society between 1895 and 1900 he was raised to the peerage in 1897 he is one of only two surgeons in the united kingdom with a dedicated public monument the other is john hunter and after his death in 1912 his funeral service was held at westminster abbey lister is also the protagonist in lindsey fitzharris the butchering art joseph listers quest to transform the grisly world of victorian medicine the book follows lister from childhood precocity to his illustrious later life and along the way populates his story with gripping and emotionally charged vignettes of 19thcentury society against the grisly backdrop of victorian medicine listers story soars you are drawn into his world of personal and professional strife and follow in his footsteps from london to edinburgh to glasgow and back to london again fitzharris ably rushes the reader through 234 pages this reader made it through in a day of wounds guts pus and surgical heroics she crafts a compelling account and skilfully deploys narrative tension to keep you turning from bloodsoaked page to bloodsoaked page she evidently relishes in the macabre spinning suffering into suspense and exploiting her readers squeamishness like last years muchloved television sensation quacks the butchering art builds a busy and authentic account of victorian britain and the people who inhabited it while fitzharris is heavily reliant on the grotesque there are moments where she exhibits real tenderness for her characters the passage on listers patient julia sullivan  drawn from research conducted by ruth richardson and bryan rhodes  is particularly elegantly and emotively written pp 5866 it is also one of the places in the book where fitzharris most effectively weaves description with historical context and she deftly threads a substantial quantity of information through the narrative indeed those unfamiliar with 19thcentury medicine and society will come away from this book with ample knowledge of a fascinating epoch in british history the men and women  both professional and lay  who make up the butchering arts cast are morally complex they are variably cruel kind selfinterested generous bombastic retiring and fitzharris does well to attend to the richness of 19thcentury humanity professor james syme listers superior in edinburgh is vividly described as a fearsome and frenetic character and his chapters are some of the more absorbing in contrast lister himself is painted as an unequivocal hero driven only by humane compassion and intellectual integrity throughout fitzharris deploys a range of devices to set lister apart from his contemporaries and immediate predecessors he is deeply perceptive and devotes his life to elucidating the causes and nature of postoperative infections and finding a solution for them p 18 in an early chapter and even in youth he is portrayed as an exemplary student with an unusual moral rectitude of course not everyone at ucl was a raffish youngblood some like lister were hardworking and diligent p 31 at times her descriptions of lister stray towards the sycophantic those who knew him often commented on his striking stature and the gracefulness with which he moved he was classically handsome at this age with a straight nose full lips and brown wavy hair p 28 occasionally fitzharris efforts to elevate lister causes her to overstate his contributions or mischaracterize the interests of his contemporaries on p 47 she writes most surgeons were interested in the individual bodies of their patients not hospital populations and statistics they were largely unconcerned with the causes of diseases choosing instead to focus on diagnosis prognosis and treatment lister however would soon form his own opinions about the parlous state of hospital wards and about what could be done to address what he saw as a growing humanitarian crisis it is difficult to ascertain her justification for this sweeping claim about the interests of victorian doctors when a preoccupation with populations and statistics was at the heart of early19thcentury notions of hospital medicine and public health alike just under a hundred pages later fitzharris claims that in the eyes of lister and progressive contemporaries  a hospital was much more than  it was a place where students could learn from reallife cases p 136 while accurate this statement suggests a greater distinction between lister and others than perhaps existed the lister of the butchering art is not just possessed with preternatural insight but is also superlatively compassionate he exhibited an acute empathy with patients p 141 fitzharris reports that he recommended to his students that they use technical words so that nothing was said or suggested that could in any way cause them anxiety or alarm  something that would undoubtedly be viewed as unethical today but was born purely of compassion when lister suggested it p 140 how do we know that this action was born purely of compassion when lister suggested it this narrative of lister as unusually compassionate would be made all the richer if the author had taken time to probe the reasons why he and others might be invested in presenting himself as such moreover if lister is a moral and scientific hero then the grisly world of victorian medicine is populated by parallel villains portraits of listers enemies opponents predecessors and contemporaries depict men detached from the suffering of their patients and disinterested in the reasons for their demise robert liston is a great butcher and students at ucl began to view the bodies set before them not as people but as objects p 40 while fitzharris has made good use of listers own archive  his letters form the architecture of this sympathetic biography  she has not delved extensively into the personal material or writings of other 19thcentury doctors and scientists as the butchering art is a biography of one great man this is unsurprising and perhaps appropriate however without this archival research it is difficult to ascertain where fitzharris gets her evidence for her statements about the internal worlds and moral compasses of patients and other victorian practitioners on p 17 she claims that patients worldwide came to further dread the word hospital it is notoriously difficult to access the inner lives of past patients and efforts must make careful use of scant primary source material and read against the grain to piece together the perspectives of the poor and disenfranchised we know little about what patients thought of the 19thcentury hospital in britain let alone the rest of the world fitzharris makes similar assumptions about practitioners because surgeons saw suffering on a daily basis very few felt any need to address an issue that they saw as inevitable and commonplace p 47 these are fundamentally imaginary efforts but are framed as historical or evidencebased insights the key argument in the butchering art is that lister was primarily responsible for determining that unseen animals were to blame for postoperative infection and that his efforts ushered in a new antiseptic age her characterisation of the intellectual moral and emotional landscape of 19thcentury surgery frames lister as an embattled maverick fighting against an obstructive wilfully ignorant and quasicruel medical profession however a serious engagement with the historical literature  such as that written by michael brown and christopher lawrence 1  would problematise fitzharris account of listerashero lawrences work in particular reveals that the ideas that lister championed were inkeeping with preexisting notions of wound care and hospital infection and that any continued scepticism reflected the challenges associated with evidence and witnessing in late19thcentury science2 in her own text fitzharris acknowledges that as early as the 1850s there was a perceptible shift away from miasma and toward contagion theories p 154  it is also worth mentioning that there was never much consensus over miasmatic causes of disease she devotes several pages to the ridicule of listers antiseptic system but also acknowledges that the initial resistance to listers antiseptic methods had little to do with whether they actually worked p 179 and much more to do with his questionable claims to priority and to the illeffects associated with dousing wounds with corrosive carbolic acid while lister and the antiseptic method certainly faced opposition it was relatively shortlived as fitzharris observes as early as 1892 lister was received with thunderous applause in paris p 228 and celebrated as a hero of surgery p 229 at a more granular level the author could have benefited from an engagement with the literature on the use of microscopes and the application of physiology and pathology to 19thcentury clinical practice for example see l s jacyna and rosemary wall3 together they explain the complex rationales behind why these tools and techniques were rejected and accepted in certain different contexts indeed fitzharris focuses on the microscope as listers ultimate weapon in the war against sepsis  particularly in chapter one  and his peculiar microscopic skill is taken as evidence of his superlative status amongst doctors the microscope is like lister a hero of her story it was sleek handsome powerful a symbol of scientific progress p 19 the microscopes status as a symbol of scientific progress was tenuous and contested  for good reason even with the relative clarity of 21stcentury microscopes science students today have to be taught how to see and what to see their 19thcentury counterparts were also acutely aware of the limitations of microscopic vision at its core this book is an archetype of the great man genre of history writing it is also acutely whiggish and teleological lister triumphs over the discord of his age and welcomes a new dawn the book is peppered with progressivist phrases like the age of agony was nearing its end p 15 that allude to the introduction of anaesthesia but brush over the enduring challenges facing the safe and consistent use of chloroform similarly the prologue concludes with  abdomen hacked away by the knives of eager students who afterwards carelessly tossed the decomposing organs back into the gory cavity p 37 while few would deny that victorian healthcare was plagued with suffering and distress as various historians have shown doctors and surgeons were not unaffected by their patients pain and they at least had a more complex relationship with the place of emotions in operative practice than the butchering art indicates4 while no critical historian of medicine wants to exculpate doctors of all moral responsibility and abuses of power this caricature of 19thcentury surgery does a disservice to the many men and women who worked to ameliorate suffering in challenging circumstances in contrast opportunities for a serious critique of the morals and motivations of some 19thcentury surgeons are curiously bypassed james marion sims  who used enslaved black women as experimental subjects without anaesthesia  is described only as an illustrious gynaecological surgeon p 39 indeed it was tempting to divide this review into two parts one an assessment of the book on scholarly terms and two an assessment of the books capacity to engage the public with historical research as i noted at the beginning of this review the butchering art makes for a compelling read and will no doubt provide those uninitiated into the world of 19thcentury medicine with plenty of interesting information however while this book has been a commercial and critical success it has been written as though much of the recent research on late19thcentury science medicine and surgery  as well as the political and theoretical seachanges within and without the historical profession  had not taken place and yet i dont want to force a distinction between scholarship and public engagement squaring academic rigour with popular and commercial success is of course challenging moreover i think professional historians today have issues with narrative  it can be difficult to coax historiographical critique and accounts of complexity into a compelling story this is not a comment on writing style  many academics writing for academic consumption write clearly and with elegance but just because it is difficult does not mean it cannot be done writing listerashero flattens the narrative and misses a valuable opportunity to engage publics with the idea that the history of science and medicine might not work in quite the way they think it does the butchering art may be largely accurate but it does a disservice to the complexity of the era it describes in my experience people within and without academia alike are comfortable with nuance and also with the idea that science is socially constructed and historically contingent for example historians of science technology and medicine  perhaps unusually for historians in general  are often called upon to teach students who might be coming to the humanities and social sciences for the first time as part of interdisciplinary bas intercalating medical students or masters students with stem backgrounds these students are entirely capable of critically assessing their predecessors and of using that assessment to reconsider the power dynamics of contemporary scientific research and healthcare if they can do it anyone can indeed an exploration of power dynamics is almost entirely missing from fitzharris account late19thcentury medicine is populated by a range and diversity of fascinating characters and is made up of a complex community of practitioners and patients that make a far more interesting subject than any one individual some of the most successful history books that attempt to engage a nonacademic audience published recently such as miranda kaufmanns black tudors and fern riddells death in ten minutes offer something new and challenging they prompt their readers to rethink who populates history and what that history might look like doctors at least some of them are particularly guilty of writing and consuming an outdated model of great man history  likely in part because it bolsters their truth claims and supports their already considerable social capital  and im sure the butchering art appeals to those currently in the medical profession lister was a hero of medicine in his lifetime and he continues to be one of the few characters of the 19th century that clinicians today recall fitzharris recapitulates a wellworn narrative  reifying lister as almost solely responsible for the scientific and medical progress of the 19th and 20thcenturies one of the great advantages of writing the type of book that fitzharris has written is that it provides an almost unparalleled opportunity to challenge provoke and steer the conversation in new directions without necessarily being trammelled by some of the constraints and conventions of academic writing and peer review writing a good story is a skill that many academics do not have and do not want and it is an impressive and necessary skill but the real value in engaging publics with the history of medicine is  i would argue  in its radical and political potential in its capacity to show the diverse characters involved in past and present medical and scientific work to dismantle ideas that medicine is and was populated only by middle or upperclass white men and to expose people to the possibility that scientific and medical truth claims are just that  claims  and that we should be profoundly sceptical of any narratives

purchase helps support npr programming how amazon independent bookstores to read the butchering art you should have a stronger stomach than mine the book makes no bones pun unfortunately intended about what youll find inside  its subtitled joseph listers quest to transform the grisly world of victorian medicine so youre duly forewarned and i thought i knew more or less what i was in for i knew about the disgusting sanitary conditions in 19thcentury hospitals i knew about the muchtooslow development of anesthesia i knew the chilling quote from dr charles meigs about the impossibility that a doctor could carry disease on his person between patients doctors are gentlemen and a gentlemans hands are clean i still wasnt ready at heart its a slender but effective biography of lister the sort of comforting historical figure more interested in his work than his legacy first as a student and then as a surgeon he was obsessed with the postoperative infections that killed so many patients that many doctors wouldnt operate on the torso because of the likelihood of death from infection gangrene erysipelas and septicemia were so prevalent they were collectively called hospitalism  the disease you contracted after the doctors had taken care of what ailed you shots  health news the butchering art how a 19th century physician made surgery safer shots  health news how moldy hay and sick cows led to a lifesaving drug the butchering art traces listers lifelong obsession with finding an antiseptic treatment a quest balanced somewhere between serendipity and sisyphus his inventor father gifted him the sort of microscope that can see bacteria and he spent decades trying to figure out what exactly he was looking for he is a subtle figure as biographies go  with the exception of his published medical papers most reactions to his triumphs and failures in this bloody and butchering department of the healing art are pulled from private letters to family his marriage is so uneventful it hardly exists and nearly all thirdparty talk of him is about his skill as a doctor and his hunt for an antiseptic cure he disappears into his work were left to be grateful for it and after the book sets forth the conditions in which lister began his lifes work we definitely are the details are almost unavoidably ghoulish lindsey fitzharris tries to paint a vivid picture without unnecessary gore but so much gore is necessary  not just descriptions of anestheticfree amputations but of patients turned away from hospitals because they were too poor to rent a bed or were incurable and therefore not worth treating some of it reads as the brutal relic of a vanished past some of it reads as a brutal relic of the present this is a book in which cancer is as immediate a character as any of the gentlemen fighting over corpses in the hopes of surgical immortality after lister makes his great discovery the book becomes a slightly more remote horror story lister trying to disprove those who stood against him as he pleaded for his methods fitzharris traces listers predecessors mentors and detractors all of whose work informed the whole the butchering art is very careful to emphasize the many threads of scientific study that come together in a sea change like this one and its equally careful to quietly remind us that in every hospital that dismissed listers methods hundreds died since we already know all the gory details it feels about as awful as it should equal parts a queasy outline of victorian medicine and a quiet story of a life spent pushing for scientific progress the butchering art sounds like something of a niche read but in an era where science is as much a battleground as it was two centuries ago there is something that feels vital in a book about horrors everyone accepted as the costs of doing business and the importance of persistence in seeing results just  maybe dont read it on a full stomach facebook flipboard email read  listen home news culture

managed the crossover as effectively as roy porter or ruth richardson lindsey fitzharriss praiseworthy aim is to revive interest in joseph lister who may be fading from memory except via listerine a product that took his name without permission his early antiseptic methods rapidly superseded by asepsis led some to doubt whether he really was the father of modern surgery yet when he died in 1912 his reputation seemed unassailable reinforced in 1917 in the biography by his nephew rickman godlee1 memoirs by listers admirers kept his fame alive through the 1920s but the biographical narrative has largely dried up since fitzharriss main strength is her account of listers life from early days until the access of fame in the 1870s she uses his extensive family correspondence to relate engagingly many details that godlees generation ignored including listers lifestyle and his personal relationships she relies on many of the old hagiographic accounts and is not inclined to be critical but makes a good case for listers many virtues personal and scientific she describes effectively his use of microscopy and the development of his bacteriological theories she reminds us that lister himself used the term the butchering art and how unusual it was for an able practitioner to choose specialisation in surgery rather than the more lucrative post of physicianwhy should we hesitate to hand this book over to students who need more readable texts google the butchering art and a review extract appears on multiple sites readers interested in the medical field cant go wrong with this one unfortunately they canfitzharris follows listers career well but is weaker on historical context succumbing to popular historys search for colour at all costs for example she details one of listers first operations in 1851 recently uncovered by richardson and rhodes where the patient had been stabbed by her jealous husband2 lister gave evidence at the trial which ended in a sentence of transportation fitzharris then generalises one in three died on the gruelling sea passage which could take as long as eight months while transportees did not return home after release because they were terrified of the voyage p 70 by 1851 mortality was about 3 per cent on the highly regulated convict ships and voyages took just over 3 months while the continuing destitution of many transportees is a more convincing explanation for failure to return was this convict actually transported by 1851 many transportation sentences were commuted to prison all this dubious detail is irrelevant to listers story listers move to glasgow produces a familiar quotation on its terrible alleyways in the text it is attributed to engels following a personal visit to glasgow in the endnotes its accurately but confusingly attributed to jc symons i could find no evidence that engels ever visited glasgow on p167 there are some strange statistics 2 deaths among 10 patients do not make a failure rate of 18 per cent etclister sometimes gets more credit than he deserved in 1877 he apparently left the edinburgh royal infirmary confident that it would be safe in the hands of his disciples for it was now bright clean and well ventilated p 226 yet it would take some years before listers disciples were sufficiently powerful to do much and a new infirmary was already planned the infirmarys board did not take advice from lister whose wards were notoriously overcrowded owing to his patients lengthy postsurgical recovery but from florence nightingale whose nurses were already changing hygienic practices in the old establishment on p 41 w t gairdners warning to medical students about their own mortality is inserted into a section on student mortality from careless dissection of cadavers gairdner undoubtedly had in mind the major causes of student mortality tuberculosis and infectious diseaseattacking errors is an otiose businesswe all make thembut these should have been corrected for the penguin edition more serious is the failure to engage in any historical debate that might slow up the sparky narrative it is asserted more than once that patients in the voluntary hospitals had to pay for their board and lodging this was probably true of some of specialised hospitals and of some eighteenthcentury hospitals but it was not true of voluntary hospitals by the midnineteenth century as medical staff gained more power over admissions they resisted patient payments as stealing fees from local practitioners and discouraging essential charitable donations patients were rarely asked to provide more than clean nightshirts and tea in birmingham hospital almoners worked hard to prevent the admission of anyone who could paythe most arguable section however is the presentation of prelisterian hospitals where fitzharris contends inconsistently that the poor feared the terrible conditions even though patient demand outstripped supply it seems that john woodwards wellknown work which seriously questioned the gateways to death thesis was written in vain3 readers of the butchering art will be left with a very oldfashioned view of the subject the real gateways to death are of course modern western hospitals since so many of us decide or are persuaded to die in them footnotes 1john godlee rickman lord lister london macmillan  co 19172ruth richardson and bryan rhodes joseph
