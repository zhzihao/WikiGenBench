This region consists of arrays of temples in varying sizes and devoted to different gods and goddess but the common thread unifying this group is that the temples are constructed in terracotta. The region consists of following districts Birbhum, Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia and parts of Murshidabad. The construction style originated in 16th century and lasted till the 19th century. This period is also referred as a golden age of temple in West Bengal. Reason for development of this construction technique was the rich red laterite soil of the region and lack of construction worthy stone. The skill of creating daily objects from like vessels, pottery, seal and toys evolved into a construction technique in the time of need. These temples are baked terracotta panels or bricks. This particular style spread outside the present day West Bengal as well, to Jharkhand, Bihar, Assam and Tripura.\n\nHistory \nReligious landscape of bengal was dominated by Nagar style temple till 12th century and after that few centuries were dedicated to Islamic religious building till the 16th century. After the throne was ascended by Malla Bir Hambir of the Mala Dynasty and he became the disciple of Acharya Srinivas, which led to establishment of a Vaishnava culture. Establishment of the Vaishnav movement, especially Radha-Krishna cult lead to the construction of terracotta temples in the region. Muslim rulers during this period were religiously tolerant and allowed the other religions to flourish which contributed in development of Vaishnav culture and construction of magnificent terracotta temple.\n\nStory of Bir Hambir embracing Vaishnavism \nAccording to the treaties of the Prem-vilasa of Nityananda Das alias Balaram Das and the Bhakti-ratnakara of Narahari Chakravarti, Bir Hambir was a wicked king, who robbed Acharya Srinivas and his devotees while they were on their way to Gaur from Vrindavan. Acharya Srinivas did not give up and stood strong, he persuaded the King read to Bhagavad. This experience transformed him and motivate him to become a follower of Vaishnavism.\n\nConstruction technique \nConstruction of the terracotta temple consists of a brick masonry core. In case of the walls, the brick core is made of horizontally laid bricks followed by a layer of  lime plaster, on which  baked terracotta panels are then affixed. Bricks are also laid horizontally on stretchers for roofing system of  vaults and domes. For construction of arches the bricks are cut out is tapering manner to form voussoirs, the curved brick also aided in making vaults and swelled cornices as well. Major construction materials were fired bricks and lime mortar. Lime mortar was created by processing snail shells and for roofing a very hard  traditional plaster was used. In some cases the decorative terracotta panels were embedded in the wall. Different shapes of bricks are also used  in making contours and surface modulations in facade and contours.\n\nArchitectural style \nTerracotta temples is divided into four categories as per their form composition and structure  style and not the construction style - Chala, Ratna, Deul and Dalan. The temples of pre-Muslim period can be called tall curvilinear rekha deul. Popularly seen hut style temples have two variations Chala and Bangla style, this style is influenced from huts of bengal, commonly known a Bengal Roof. Chala temple consists of a sloping roof joined at curvilinear edges and ending in arched cornices, there are further variations in the style in which the number of chalas are increased or their formation is modified. Do Chala style has a roof  sloping on two sides with a ridge at the top, another style is Jor Bangla which is composed of twin do chala attached to each other. Further modification of do chala is char chala which is a four sided sloping roof and then ath chala which is a char chala mounted with smaller char chala. Plan of these temple are generally simple, composed of a square or rectangle.\n\nGround floor plan remains a simple square or rectangle in Ratna style as well, the differentiation is seen in the case of the roof. The roofing system is composed of a flat roof with pinnacle tower on top, each tower is considered as a temple and are generally present in odd numbers. Name of the typology changes as per the number of towers such as ek-ratna (single-spired) and pancha-ratna (five-spired) and naba-ratna (nine-spired). Maximum number of towers or spires seen are twenty five.\n\nTheme and motifs of ornamentation \nThe region was  under the influence of Vaishnaba Padabolies and Rasashastra. In accordance to the said influence , we find that the walls are adorned with  plaques depicting Krishna katha and Ramakatha, providing historical influence about Chaitanyadev and the Bhakti movement. The ornamentation is not concentrated just on the main body of the temple but can be observed on pillar and niches as well.\n\nThe motifs depicted on the temples are from four categories plants, animals, solar system and geometric. Lotus is one of the most common occurring plant motif, in both bud and blooming stage, surrounded by other flowers.  Motifs related to animals represented by  swan, peacock, fish, tigers, lions, monkeys, elephants, horses, ostrich birds etc. Sun moon and stars also occur frequently.Geometrical motifs are seen on horizontal bands with composition including basic shapes like square, rectangle, triangle, half-circle and lines.\n\nIconography of Krishna Katha in terracotta temples \nCommon representation of Krishna in the temples of Baranagar, Murshidabad is a figure which appears repeatedly in a certain posture. Frequently both his hands are up like holding on to a flute, occasionally the flute is held in one hand, his legs are either crossed or straight and sometimes in a dancing position. The figure is generally surrounded by one or more female attendants and at times with cows. The female attendants could be gopis or Radha, also the scene is generally represented under a tree or inside a small tent. Radha and Krishna together are generally represented in dancing posture, at times both are playing flutes. In some cases Krishna has his arm around Radha, while she rests her head on his shoulder. Similar to the above depictions the scene is composed under a tree or inside a small tent. These representation can be mostly seen on mostly all parts of the building including pillars, wall , corners and base frieze.\n\nFamous terracotta temples\n\nRasa Mancha Temple \n\nThis is one of the earliest and most dignified temple constructed King Bir Hambir in 1600 after he adopted Vaishnav culture in Bishnupur. The temple sits on a square plan  and the roof in the centre is in a pyramid form, four corners of the arcade are topped with a small challa roofs and intermediate portions are mounted with domical structure. Each side of the square plan measures 24.5 metres and the height of the structure excluding the roof is 10.7 metres, built on 1.5 metre high plinth. The temple consists of 108 gates adorned with lotus and mangol ghat motifs, lotus is also seen in other parts of temple. There is a prominent representation of Sri Chaitanyadev doing namaskar, other images depicted include goddess Saraswati and tribal women.\n\nJorbangla Temple \nThis is a prominent  example of Jor Bangla roofing described in the architecture section. This temple is also located in Bishnupur and was constructed by Raghunath Singh I in 1665. Plan of the temple is almost a square measuring 11.8metres by 11.7 with a height o 10.7 meters. The temple is profusely decorated with terracotta panels depicting scenes of Mahabharata, Ramayana and Krishna Lila.. One of the panels reveal Raghunath  I as son of Bir Hambir.\n\nSee also \n\n List of temples in Bishnupur\n Maluti temples\n Bankura horse\n Terracotta\n Architecture of Bengal\n\nFurther reading \n\n McCutchion, David J.

introduction clay can be considered as one of the oldest building materials in the history of man after stone clay was and is being used for all conceivable purposes due to its abundance and universal supply the discovery of baking clay provided the permanence to the clay objects this baked clay is called as terracotta all over the world across the ages people have transformed this heavy dark and formless material into a lighter building material they created their living spaces and they adapted their architectural and constructive answers according to the behavior and properties of the soil the use of terracotta as a material evolved from making objects of daily needs like vessels pottery toys seals etc in ancient times to its use in temples in the 15th16th century ad in west bengal until this period stone was the main material used for building temples this was due to unavailability of the stone and availability of good alluvial soil and the need to create pseudo effect eg in west bengal terracotta was used to depict stone carvings and sometimes to resemble the articulation on wooden door in the same period from 15th to early 20th century terracotta was used as cheaper and easily available option for marble in some parts of europe terracotta as a material till now has taken different influences to reach the urban scale from a material predominantly used for household and domestic use it has been slowly shifting to building and construction industry nowadays with the help of technology terracotta has been experimented to its fullest considering its qualities and has been used in construction in certain parts of india this paper attempts to understand one stage of its transformation where terracotta was explored and modified according to the need of that time in west bengal historical backgorund of temple architecture of bengal in bengal art sometimes was expressed mainly through the medium of temples brick temples of bengal were built between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries these temples form one of the most distinctive groups of sacred monuments in india due to the multiple artistic influences acting upon the region bengali temples show a wide range of forms and techniques the bengali temples nevertheless constitute a coherent series in both their architecture and sculpture characteristically expressed in brick and terracotta the map above fig1 shows the different regions of bankura district out of all the regions bishnupur flourished as a great monumental expression of hindu terracotta art in bengal temple facades in bishnupur are majorly covered with figurative sculptures often on four sides and sometimes even extending in the interior bishnupur literally means city of lord vishnu this may be derived from the fact that the kings of bishnupur were followers of vaisnavism during the 15th and 16th centuries bengal underwent a profound political social religious and cultural revolution the chief result of which was the formation of a distinct regional identity over a period of time bishnupur town has evolved incorporating various social concepts planning philosophies strategic decisions which were deeply rooted in bengali traditions the few temples preserved in bengal built before 14th century indicates that bengali architecture was closely associated with contemporary traditions that flourished throughout northern and eastern india the history of religious architecture in bengal can be divided into three periods 1 early hindu up to the end of 12th century 2 sultanate period 14th to early 16th century 3 hindu revival 16th to 19th century in primitive stage that is during early hindu period it takes the character of mayuryan and premayuryan art of india in this early stage the terracottas consist of stray cult pieces of small sizes in later stages 14th16th centuries terracotta plaques appeared with new designs which were different from the primitive illustration of the same theme in the next stage terracottas appeared in larger sizes and related to architectural structures as decorations of the facades of the temples popularization of sanskrit scriptures in bengali translation have built up the hindu revival which gave rise to most popular cults like krishna kali durga these were the main inspiration behind the revival of hindu art and architecture almost all the richly decorated temples of 16th century which still exist are mainly radhakrishna temples these temples have terracotta decoration which is of vaishnava origin compared to the brick structures the result is not just constructional but also decorative these temples have elaborate representation of themes which are borrowed from the puranas hence these temple decorations were also acting as a medium to educate common people about our culture and traditions most of the decorations are typically gupta in style largeness of conception the dramatic vigor and the liveliness of the pictures depicted on bricks and plaques stand for the vividness of wall paintings and frescoes the dearth of which is compensated by these pictures on bricks and plaques one of the most remarkable features of the history of this monumental architecture in bengal is the sharp break in tradition that coincided with the muslim conquest architects working for muslim patrons developed a preference for covering entire wall surface with finely worked terracotta plaques that incorporated traditional decorative motifs such as the lotus by the end of the 16th century a uniquely bengali style of temples architecture and sculpture had established itself as the hindu artistic expression of the new social religious and cultural revolution the wide range of temple styles embraced elements of both change and continuity typical in the dynamic but traditionally based bengali society furthermore the temple decoration depicted the aspects of everyday life of the contemporary society particularly the ambitions of the temple builders this shows that temple building was the result of an intense concentration of economic and artistic resources as well as public means of expressing power the temple builders the plaques of terracotta give us a glimpse of the early culture of the people of the bengal which is not available in bengal literature this proves that this plastic art supports the literary art of bengal in bengal only two caste forms can be traced  the acharyas and sutradharas the role of the acharyas and sutradharas indicates an age old relationship of working together that existed in india these terracotta reliefs are noteworthy contribution of these artists these artists derived their inspiration not only from the standard rules and regulations of the shilpa sashtras but also from the keen observations of the daily lives of the people around in course of time sutradharas became capable of using materials like stone ivory metal etc and became skilful artists they accordingly developed into four different directions namely  kastha wood mrttika clay chitra painting pasan stone and divided themselves into several regional groups the sutradharas worked as a group and each consisting of several families and having their hereditary knowledge used to live and work under acharyas who were responsible for planning and supervision these teams used to travel from one place to another the heads of these groups had readymade master plans of temples of varied size and shapes and they use to carry these plans with them then according to donors choice and even details regarding arrangements of terracotta bricks according to the theme and pattern used to be completed and necessary instructions were issued by the leader before the commencement of the construction as the majority of bengalis during this period were illiterate terracotta artists had little opportunity to acquaint themselves with the sanskrit puranas epics and other source books of mythologies for these artists knowledge of the epics and myths was mainly derived from the works of local bengali poets particularly in the form of popular dramas and songs these poets translated and retold the stories for the benefit of villagers and also introduced new episodes and their own interpretation in it without any hesitation this brought atmosphere of contemporary society in their stories and poetries bringing their works nearer to the hearts of bengalis and profoundly influenced the artists who decorated the temples of the period for example the influence on contemporary society is seen in mangal kavyas as well as in the portrayals of the marriage of shiva and parvati in temple art in the depiction of this popular scene temple artists didnt follow the standard iconographic texts but preferred to represent parvati as a small girl and shiva as a half naked old man while describing the marriages between the poor and homeless shiva and the beautiful parvati poet drew upon scenes of ordinary bengali life in which girls of tender age were sometimes given in marriage to old men in their descriptions of such scenes poets did not hesitate to emphasize the pain and regret of the young girl and this was true in 18th and 19th century when marriage between old men and young girls was a common practice hence this way the different epics of puranas were recited by storytellers at village gatherings and undoubtedly influenced terracotta artists of that time temple planning the overall form and arrangement is different from the other indian temple typologies the popular sequence of bhogmandapa natmandapa garbhagriha is absent here there are limited number of architectural elements used in temple plan  square rectangular octagonal chambers and long rectangular corridors and porches these spaces are vaulted or domed and are limited in size walls are generally slender in size 75cm to 125 cm except certain exceptions like massive brickwork at kodla almost 3m thick which is obvious imitation of stonework the axiality present in the other indian typologies towards certain preferred direction is quite subdued characteristic of bengali brick architecture is the pointed vault on the rectangular plan with curved base and spine producing the interior of a bangla roof form the pillars used in these temples with triple arches were essentially based on pillars built in stone during palasena period when used in brick temples some changes were introduced in these pillars since the pillars used on the facades of these temples became main feature and were decorated with terracotta panels of smaller sizes the square bases and square capitals were changed to octagonal and the shaft became multifaceted fig2 the shafts were further divided by two to five mouldings into smaller parts to afford decoration by the terracotta panels stone doorways of the earlier elaborate design were not used in these temples but there patterns were copied the walls of these temples were generally flat and any articulation was provided by the framing of the panels on the wall style and ornamentation sculptures on the temple façade of bengal are carefully organized with respect to their architectural setting islamic builders imitated the earlier patterns carved in stone and also introduced a great variety of strip motifs also there is more preference for large scale figurative art than the earlier nonfigurative themes one significant omission on any late medieval temples is the use of the glazed tiles which were so frequently used on the islamic structures of the sultanate period in the late 15th century generally facades of these temples were divided into panels by vertical horizontal and curved bands fig 3 4 on certain temples like keshta raya temples kalachand temple these panels are uniformly distributed over the facades gently growing over the entrance sculptural characteristic of these temples are not only crowded compositions within individual panels but also on overall facades of the temple compositions above the arches friezes and panels have a distinct rhythmic effect created by frequent repetition of identical panels in case of keshtaraya temple above the regular square panels depicting ramayana and krishnalila episodes is a system of beam like elements suggesting a corbelled timber construction in madanmohana temple façade derives its essential rhythm from the manipulation of the bands framing panels in which active dramatic scenes take place fig 5 the description of the sculptures in these different parts indicates the development of decorative elements from simple vegetal ornamentation to figurative schemes till later period some of the nineteenth century bankura temples show clear european influence in their articulation these panels have large scale composition in high relief above their triple arched porches fig6 material and construction technique the temples of bengal form one of the most distinctive groups of sacred monuments in india incorporating a wide range of forms and techniques that testify to the multiple artistic influences acting upon the region the terracotta here expresses a faithful picture of the lives of the people through a dynamic natural quality of technique during this period for the first time local building forms were translated into permanent materials hut shapes were recreated in brick vaulting together with curved cornices and terracotta façade decoration typical islamic techniques of arches vaults and domes construction were used to create this type of architecture and the material adopted was brick which was locally available the bengali temples constitute a coherent series in both their architecture and sculpture characteristically expressed in brick and terracotta even though stone was mainly used for construction till this period there are rarely any stone temples in this province due to scarcity of stone very rarely temples were built or even faced with stone fig7 these temples are found majorly in southwestern periphery of bengal where coarse grained laterite is available throughout the rest of bengal temples are almost invariably built of bricks also yellow sandstone is available in northern burdwan and adjacent purulia except these places throughout the rest of the bengal temples are invariably built of bricks the early brick temples of gupta pala and sena period used stone as door jambs lintels and pillars but brick temples of bengal have wooden doors which are decorated with terracotta depicting human and animal figure compositions as well as floral and geometrical designs in panels studying from the numerous ruined temples it can observed that the brick core of the temples generally consist of well laid horizontal brick courses vaults and domes are also created with bricks laid as stretchers in arches bricks are cut to form tapering voussoirs fig15 curved layers of brickwork are employed to create vaults as well as swelling contours of temple cornices and roofs sometimes bricks are laid diagonally to decorate supporting arches and pendentives in 18th and 19th century many temple facades were plaster coated in combination with terracotta sculptures fired bricks were laid in mortar composed of powdered brick and lime lime was obtained by processing snails shells fine but very hard pankha plaster was used to coat roofs vaults and walls of temples the surface skin of the terracotta plaques is carefully knitted into the brick core of the building fig8 9 10 11 nonstandardization in construction well fired brick is the basic building material for temple making in bengal brick sizes vary not only from region to region and from century to century but also within the same building following drawing will help to understand how different sizes of bricks were used to get required effect or to create pseudo effect of stone construction figs13 14 bricks are generally laid as stretchers with half bricks to fill the gaps and avoid successive vertical joints fig12 surface brickwork when covered with terracotta sculptures organized into overall façade schemes displays considerable skill of the craftsman different shapes of bricks are used such as long thin bricks laid edgewise as framing bands triangular bricks as filling pieces and flat plaques coordinated in large scale sculptural compositions these all carefully interlock dimensions shown are indicative to show nonstandardization of bricks deterioration of temples these temple builders were active up to the middle of the 19th century and numerous temples of different sizes and shapes were built with excellent terracotta work till this period from the early 19th century western influence on styles and themes and features became stronger and due to several socioeconomic factors the quality and quantity of temple building as well as of terracotta work rapidly declined architects and artisans who were dependant on local patronage found themselves without work and were forced to turn to other crafts such as wood carving scroll painting and had to give up their own craft the others who were less ambitious and more home loving were turned neglected group of society and were known as chutar or wood carvers by the middle of nineteenth century terracotta sculptures were being replaced by stuccowork but art stayed until 1930s further in twentieth century temple building continued in traditional and neoclassical style by adopting modern building materials like steel concrete replacing brick and terracotta today these brick temples are frequently disfigured or even concealed by ugly concrete additions and new concrete temples coming up everywhere modern terracotta from the above study we can say that terracotta as a material tried to fulfill the need of that time it was modified explored to its fullest during 15th  19th century in west bengal nowadays with the help of technology terracotta is been explored as a structural material and its no more a material only for surface embellishment at every stage of its transformation this material tried to fulfill the need of time and human need to explore evolve and grow with time and technology we can also say that over a period of time terracotta has been transformed over following parameters from domestic use to industrial use form nonstandardized to standardized from composition to specification from nonstructural to structural by exploring the properties of clay with the help of technology about terracotta hollow blocks in india solid bricks are so extensively used in construction but they have certain disadvantages like these are more expensive to lay heat insulation property is poor water absorption is high consumes more energy and soil and due to this depleting topsoil these problems have been overcome by using perforated bricks with 50 to 60 per cent perforations these perforations act as a sound and heat insulators also due to better manufacturing techniques water absorption is low they effectively save clay dry faster and require less fuel for burning as compared to solid bricks also these large size bricks help increase the masons output below are certain images showing how these terracotta clay hollow blocks have been explored in architecture as well as in interiors mostly in southern part of india product range of clay
