The cast features Tatum, Thomas, Whitney Weir, Budd Diaz, Robert Longstreet, Christian Lee Hutson, and Teresa Lee.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at Slamdance Film Festival on January 27, 2022 and was released on February 3, 2023 by Utopia. It was released in France by Damned Distribution under the title Ghost Therapy.\n\nPlot\nThe film opens on a couple sleeping in a cabin. They are awoken and disturbed by a noise within the home.\n\nClay (Tatum) is unemployed, living in Los Angeles with his wife, Whitney (Weir). When she leaves town, he promises he'll get out of the house and attempt to book a photography gig. Clay tries some get-rich-quick schemes to pay rent, including staging a fake open house in his apartment.\n\nWhile shooting photos of a mattress spray painted with the phrase \"5G killed my dog\", Clay notices a man in the background and is annoyed that he is ruining the shot. Whit (Thomas), is pleased that Clay sees him and he insists on tagging along. The two are old friends from high school, but Clay had ignored Whit's texts when they separately moved to LA. Whit fills Clay in on his success as an actor in small indie roles. He explains that his unusual outfit (purple button-up shirt, green pants, purple trench coat) is due to a recent costume-fitting for a role.\n\nThe two spend the night at Clay's house, where Whit feigns drinking alcohol and falling asleep. In the morning, Clay asks Whit to leave, but Whit insists that he cannot: he's dead, unable to open doors or hold anything, and Clay is the only person that has been able to see or hear him since becoming a ghost. Clay takes a Polaroid of Whit and becomes distressed when the photo develops and Whit is not pictured.\n\nClay allows Whit to spend time with him while Whitney is out of town. Clay convinces Budd (Diaz) to bring him to a private poker game hosted by Arnold (Longstreet). Whit looks at everyone's cards undetected and communicates their contents to Clay. As they return home, Clay is attacked in an alley by a man he had scammed at the open house. The man disappears into dust.\n\nWhen Whitney returns to LA, Clay asks Whit to give him a week to figure out how to integrate Whit into his life, since Whitney cannot see or hear Whit. Whit reluctantly agrees to give Clay space and follows Belle (Lee), who had been the hostess at Arnold's game, home with her date (Hutson). Whit attempts to watch the two have sex, but leaves in shame.\n\nMeanwhile, Clay researches other people who have been haunted and becomes convinced that he is in danger either by Whit's hands or his own. He pretends to be unable to see or hear Whit when Whit returns days earlier than they had agreed.\n\nClay tricks Whit into getting into his car and locks him inside overnight. Whit, unable to open doors, screams and begs Clay to let him out. In the morning, Clay tells Whitney that he got a job through his friend Andy Samberg. He drives out of LA with Whit, where the two rent a cabin and attempt to devise a plan for Whit's undetected presence in Clay's life.\n\nClay and Whit get along throughout their time alone. They take photos, chat, and dance. Clay leaves the cabin door open so Whit can come and go as he pleases. During a power outage, Clay is convinced that Whit has the ability to shut the lights off and accuses him of killing the man in the alley and other poltergeist powers. In the morning, Clay hides a broken statue of the cabin owner's beloved horse in the attic. Whit expresses gratitude for Clay's friendship and that they'll be together forever. He confesses that he is not a successful actor: he's dressed like Heath Ledger's Joker because he is a street performer who was beaten to death by fellow performers dressed as Pennywise and Deadpool.\n\nClay and Whit share an awkward apology and Clay encourages Whit to check out the attic\nafter Whit expresses curiosity. Clay closes the attic ladder behind him. Whit, unable to escape, screams and begs Clay to let him out. Clay collects his things, gets in his car, and drives away.\n\nCast\n Clay Tatum as Clay\n Whitmer Thomas as Whit\n Whitney Weir as Whitney\n Budd Diaz as Budd\n Robert Longstreet as Arnold\n Teresa Lee as Belle\n Christian Lee Hutson as Belle's Date\n Anthony Oberbeck as Chucky\n DeMorge Brown as Hippie\n Anna Seregina as Cabin Couple\n Chris Thayer as Cabin Couple\n\nAdditional unnamed roles are played by Mitra Jouhari, Trinidad James, and Problem.\n\nProduction\nTatum and Thomas wrote, produced, and shot the film during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to Tatum, the film was shot on a shoestring budget and was funded by an old friend of Tatum’s from college. The producer had come across his shorts and offered Tatum $30,000 to shoot a feature. Prior, the pair unsuccessfully attempted to finance the project via gambling. Producers had access to basic equipment, but the production avoided expenses like trailers, trucks, walkie-talkies, makeup tents, and so forth.\n\nThe cabin in the film was in Frazier Mountain, CA, where the production team broke a family heirloom of the owner, which mirrors the breaking of the Blueberry horse statue in the movie.\n\nRelease\nThe film had its world premiere at Slamdance Film Festival on January 27, 2022 and was released on February 3, 2023 by Utopia.

It holds a 100% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 29 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With a satisfying blend of humor and melancholy, The Civil Dead finds creative partners Clay Tatum and Whitmer Thomas taking a haunting look at the pitfalls of friendship.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 66 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\nJeannette Catsoulis of the New York Times noted \"The movie’s lighting is warm and the soundtrack close to perfect, yet underneath lies a persistent melancholy, a pervasive sense of men not making it in a place where the true terror is loneliness\" and Noel Murray of The Los Angeles Times said \"The movie’s premise is clever; but what really makes it work is that these two use this ghost schtick as a way to examine the ways that friendship can be a hassle.\"\n\nRegarding the chemistry of characters and overall tone, C.J. Prince of The Film Stage said, \"The fact that both leads are real-life friends goes a long way, given the baggy pacing and some of the more uneven comedic moments, and Tatum’s usage of long takes helps increase the awkward tension of both characters’ forced arrangement.\"\n\nAccolades \nThe Civil Dead won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2022 Slamdance Film Festival. In the same year it won the Jury Award for Best North American Narrative Feature at Mammoth Lakes Film Festival.

is a ghost story but its not a horror movienor is it casper the friendly ghost its not trying to impart any grand ideas its just two friends director clay tatum and cowriter whitmer thomas cobbling together a film about two very different people who cross paths in an unexpected way translation whit whitmer thomas is dead and only childhood sortoffriend clay clay tatum can see him and naming the characters after themselves raises some strange questions about thomas and tatums offcamera lives but maybe they save that for their therapists rather than focus on how or why whit became a ghost tatum and thomas instead laser in on the more mundane details can he walk through walls no can he appear to anyone else no can he get an erection also no theres a certain charm to the lowbudget approach even if you wont remember the film a week from nowwhile the laid back approach to whits ghostly existence is refreshing it never becomes profound the civil dead is at its best when it keeps the absurdist premise grounded in the blossoming sortoffriendship between whit and clay but flounders a bit when it actually goes into the supernatural even if only lightly and especially when whit explains his death to clay tatum and thomas have an easy chemistry that comes with years of friendship and the movie loses steam when it drifts away from them most especially thomas who remains charming even when whit shows an immature streak the most interesting moment comes at the very end of the film as clay does something that seems incongruous with the man weve been watching but simultaneously makes him much more interestingunfortunately the credits start to roll just after leaving us wishing that the film could have been this dynamic earlier but to its credit the civil dead never pretends to aspire to loftier ambitions and what were left with is exactly mostly what we were promised though it is frustrating to witness a kernel of something greater only as we leave clay and whit forever as these things go however the civil dead is an inoffensive enough watch and hopefully can net thomas some greater calling cards in the future the civil dead is playing at the 2022

charming slacker comedy whose drive comes from its stubborn insistence on staying lowkey a more conventional take on the same high concept might have clay and whit investigating what happened finding a medium or trying to convince others of whats going on clay is not that kind of characterhis only priorities are to either hang out with his wife or laze around when shes not thereso his investigation amounts to a single google search he abandons his attempts to find another haunted person the moment he hits a dead end and wont tell anyone else because he knows it will only lead to complications and whits new state of being is a sort of arbitrary purgatory he cant sleep is unable to touch anything and experiences time differently and thus has to depend entirely on clay to get around some viewers will probably find the films inertness with story and scale frustrating but tatum and thomas commitment and chemistry won me over the fact that both leads are reallife friends goes a long way given the baggy pacing and some of the more uneven comedic moments and tatums usage of long takes helps increase the awkward tension of both characters forced arrangement the civil deads refusal to expand beyond the limited perspectives of its two protagonists and its treatment of an extraordinary situation as little more than inconvenience is admirable enough to make for a funny entertaining experience and its great ending which deploys a sly twist that echoes back to the opening shows both filmmakers to be more clever than their modest approach would suggest the civil dead
