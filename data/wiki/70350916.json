Directed by Danish Nawaz and written by Saima Akram Chaudhry, it aired on Hum TV from 3 April 2022 to 3 May 2022, with the last episode airing on the first day of Eid-ul-Fitr. The series starred Ahad Raza Mir, Ramsha Khan, Sarah Khan and Junaid Khan.\n\nThe series revolves around two houses in one neighborhood where one house has intelligent girls while the other possesses good mannered boys. The series met with positive reviews from the audience, received critical acclaim and praises across Pakistan, India, UK and Bangladesh.\n\nAt the 22nd Lux Style Awards, the series received four nominations: Best TV Play, Best TV Actress for Ramsha Khan, Best TV Original Soundtrack and Best Ensemble Play.\n\nPlot\n\nAdam Sultan and Neha Qutub ud Din are childhood rivals and neighbors. Adam's elder brother Sarmad is a professional cook and owns a restaurant, and Sarmad has a crush on Neha's elder sister Maha. Maha is fond of yoga and keeping her body in shape and taking care of her diet. Qutub ud Din, Neha and Maha's father, pays more attention to Adam than his own daughters since he has always lamented not having a son. Adam, whose own father has neglected fatherly duties of financial and emotional care all their lives, deeply respects and cares for Qutub as well.\n\nSince childhood, Adam and Neha have shared a mutual dislike, constantly bickering and playing pranks. Both Adam and Neha are very intelligent and are liked by all professors in their university except Professor Jabir who dislikes Professor Qutub ud Din and thinks he favors Neha and Adam. In an attempt to one up each other, Neha and Adam regularly try to get the other in trouble at college and at home. On the result day Adam gets highest GPA while Neha loses her marks because of Professor Jabir as he dislikes her. Neha plans to revenge professor Jabir. Neha tells Sasha(her younger sister) to hack professor Jabir's account. After hacking Neha posts an apology from professor Jabir to her. The dean appreciates professor Jabir's apology, after seeing the post because of this dean approves his Germany research which was denied by the management many times. Going to Germany was professor Jabir's dream.\n\nAs a result, professor Jabir goes off to Germany for research work and is replaced by his own son, Sarim. At professor Jabir's recommendation of Neha as a brilliant student, Sarim starts spending time with Neha, helping her with her chemistry project with Adam. Adam begins to feel jealous and ignored by both Neha and Qutub in Sarim's presence. Soon, Adam and Sarmad's father Sultan goes to Qutub's house to propose Sarmad and Maha's be wed. At first, Qutub is skeptical about this since Maha is a divorcee but Maha says to her father to do what he thinks is right for her.\n\nAt Sarmad and Maha's mehandi, Jabir comes back and asks Qutub for Sarim and Neha to be officially engaged, which Adam overhears and becomes saddened by. Adam then realizes that he has fallen in love with Neha. Qutub asks Neha for her decision regarding Sarim's proposal to which Neha responds positively, to please her father. After Sarmad and Maha's marriage, the preparations begin for Sarim and Neha's wedding, but Neha finds out about Adam's love for her, which bemuses her. Unbeknownst to Adam, she uses this opportunity to test Adam's patience and love for her. Through this, Adam and Neha begin to talk and become friends.\n\nAt the university, Adam gets into a fight with some people that were insulting Neha. Neha comes in to stop the fight, while Sarim doesn't get involved. At Sarim and Neha's engagement, Neha confronts Adam, but Sarim interrupts. Afterwards, when Sarem takes Neha's hand, hurting her, Neha asks he let go of her hand. Adam intervenes, but Qutub gets mad at Adam for being disrespectful. Sarim realizes that he isn't worthy of Neha and breaks his engagement with Neha.\n\nAdam meets with Neha after hearing this, and they both confess their love for each other. Then, Sarmad and Maha find out they are having a baby, and they both celebrate. So both couples get their happy ending, with Adam and Neha deciding to be with each other and Sarmad and Maha celebrating their upcoming child.\n\nCast\n\nMain\n Ahad Raza Mir as Adam \"Adi\" Sultan: Sultan and Haleema's younger son; Sarmad and Maliha's brother; Neha's love interest\n Ramsha Khan as Neha Qutub ud Din: Qutub and Ulfat's second daughter; Maha and Sasha's sister; Adam's love interest\n Junaid Khan as Sarmad Sultan: Sultana and Haleema's elder son; Adam and Maliha's brother; Maha's husband\n Sarah Khan as Maha Qutub ud Din Sultan: Qutub and Ulfat's eldest daughter; Neha and Sasha's sister; Sarmad's wife\n\nRecurring\n Adnan Jaffar as Professor Qutub ud Din: Safiullah's son; Ulfat's husband; Maha, Neha and Sasha's father; Sultan's childhood friend\n Arjumand Rahim as Ulfat Qutub ud Din: Qutub's wife; Maha, Neha and Sasha's mother\n Farhan Ally Agha as Sultan Mansoor: Haleema's husband; Sarmad, Adam and Maliha's father; Qutub's childhood friend\n Munazzah Arif as Haleema Sultan: Tamanna's daughter; Sultan's wife; Sarmad, Adam and Maliha's mother\n Syed Mohammad Ahmed as Safiullah \"Safi\": Qutub's father; Maha, Neha and Sasha's grandfather\n Uzma Beg as Tamanna Begum: Haleema's mother; Sarmad, Adam and Mili's maternal grandmother\n Anoushey Rania Khan as Sasha Qutub ud Din: Qutub and Ulfat's youngest daughter; Maha and Neha's sister\n Aina Asif as Maliha \"Mili\" Sultan: Sultan and Haleema's daughter; Sarmad and Adam's sister\n Omer Shahzad as Sarim Jabir: Jabir's son; Neha's ex-fianc√©\n Danish Ali as Umar: Adam's best friend\n Ayesha Sohail as Hira: Neha's best friend\n\nGuest appearances\n Saife Hassan as Professor Jabir: Qutub's colleague; Sarim's father\n Hina Rizvi as Nargis: Safi's failed marriage prospective \n Salma Asim as Professor Saleha: Qutub's colleague; Ibtehaj's mother\n Ayaz Khan as a Professor at the university\n Bilal Cuto as Ibtehaj: Saleha's son; Maha's prospective groom\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \nIn December 2021, writer Saima Akram Chaudhry revealed in an interview that one of her upcoming Ramadan play is titled Hum Tum, which will began shooting in January.

concluding mega episode on eid day itself this ramadan is no different except that were now seeing a growing number of these soaps hum tv alone has churned out two  hum tum starring ahad raza mir ramsha khan junaid khan and sara khan and paristan which features popular vlogger taimoor salahuddin aka mooroo and content creator arsalan naseer alongside aymen saleem mira sethi naveen waqar and ali safina while geo has produced chaudhry  sons led by ayeza khan and imran ashraf junaid khan and sarah khan in hum tum image credit supplied in many ways the trend of ramadan soaps was started by hum tvs suno chanda 2018 a breezy romcom headlined by farhan saeed and iqra aziz as the boisterous bickering cousins living under one roof in a typical pakistani urban based uppermiddleclass household its a household thats teeming with grandparents uncles and aunts and nephews and nieces of all ages when the serial opens saeed and azizs characters arsal and ajiya are getting hitched soon it transpires that the match was made against their will from then on while everyone around them is shown planning a grand wedding reception arsal and ajiya are conspiring to call it off suno chanda went on to become the most successful drama serial of the year catapulting screenwriter saima akram chaudhry into the limelight the shows success was attributed especially to the variety of its supporting characters and the peculiar mannerisms and punch lines each of them is given be it shahanas humorous punjabi catchphrase nawa katta khul gya weve got a whole new problem or the monster of a kid dj played by sami khan with a wry smile and savage sense of humour who is ever ready to video family secrets on his mobile phone and then barter those videos for personal favours advertisement a still of suno chanda image credit as chaudhry puts it  was enjoyed by people of all age groups suno chanda not only introduced ramadan soap as a sort of a subgenre of tv comedy it also proved to be a franchise starter come ramadan 2019 and the makers including the production house md productions were tempted to see a repeat of the magic sami khan in suno chanda image credit the easiest way to achieve that would be to have a sequel the next we knew hum tv had readied suno chanda 2 with recurring characters and introducing an even more hyper and colourful bunch such as the lovebirds mithu played by raza talish and maina sabeen farooq the loud bebe arjumand rahim and the coquettish nagina chachi fariha jabeen it turned out to be a faithful reboot of the original and nearly as successful chaudhry claims that the audiences have since been demanding a threequel advertisement there was a gap of one year as production had slowed down in 2020 at the onset of the covid19 pandemic before hum tv came roaring back with an ensemble ramadan soap chupke chupke 2021 penned by chaudhry again with a stellar cast that includes ayeza khan osman khalid butt arsalan naseer and aymen saleem the serial not only trounced the writers other ramadan show in the same year  the madihaimamfronted ishq jalebi on geo tv  it also eclipsed hum tvs own taana baana which was broadcast in a different timeslot image credit taana baana was scripted by hassaan imam a relative newcomer who seemed to work on chaudhrys template of comedy albeit somewhat loosely here we have a family of fewer uncles and aunts and the lead pair  zain and zoya get married early on in the play taana baana marked the acting debut of singer danyal zafar opposite alizeh shah its usp were its youthful freshness and a lilting ost but it lost the race of ramadan shows precisely because its plot was a tad predictable and lacked dramatic twists and turns image credit advertisement this years lot  chaudhry  sons hum tum and paristan  arrive with a certain baggage they all are modelled on suno chanda with a few modifications here and there there is considerable spice in the form of marriagemongering and husbandhunting and the screen is usually filled up by characters who are comic fools and they utter dialogues that are often a weird concoction of punjabi english and urdu in funny accents hum tum and chaudhry  sons are both chaudhrys scripts but paristan is written by samra bukhari chaudhry says that she was very conscious of the fact that shouldnt come out looking similar while hum tum is set in an educated uppermiddleclass household chaudhry  sons is about a desi family from punjab image credit the good part is that these plays are unlike the day soap as we know it for one thing they dont deal in saasbahu conflicts hence there are no evil mothersinlaw or scheming daughtersinlaw no grieving women no toxic men and no victimisation the women generally wear the pants in the house and the men are docile and submissive they may be flirtatious but they arent harassers in fact they can be quite charming similarly the women may be sharptongued or foulmouthed but they arent capable of causing serious harm to anyone thats the fun of comedy isnt it asks chaudhry it keeps the negativity out advertisement image credit interestingly chaudhry too may not be the originator of this type of comedy she seems to borrow from the lighthearted plays of pakistans iconic playwright the late haseena moin and combine signature moin elements with the punjabi humour of commercial theatre minus the latters coarseness of course moins plays were built around an urban middleclass fantasy where money or survival isnt the issue but unrequited love is her stories were typically set in a household that is populated by doting parents and siblings caring uncles and aunts sincere friends and loyal hangerson even the house help is like family remember fazeelat bi played by azra sherwani in dhoop kinaray or bibi durdana butt in tanhaiyyan at the heart of a moin drama is a young spontaneous and inexplicably clumsy female protagonist who endears herself to the audience by virtue of her innocent good looks and the kind of funny situations she lands herself in comic relief is additionally provided by the interactions between the qabachas and saniyas from tanhaiyyan and timmi bhais and mariams ankahi however unlike todays comedies moin never needed to caricature the punjabis or pathans or people of any race for that matter in order to create humour her comedy is pure and delectable though moin too was guilty of repeating herself she influenced an entire generation of scriptwriters her influence is showing to this day especially in the way the characters and situations are built consider for instance paristans pari aymen saleem who is reminiscent of both ankahis sana murad shahnaz sheikh and tanhaiyyans saniya marina khan similarly arsam arslan naseer has shades of dhoop kinarays dr ahmer rahat kazmi advertisement chaudhry admits that moins style of comedy has been a great inspiration she also reveals that she had written faazis character in chupke chupke keeping dr ahmer in mind that osman khalid butt gave it a different identity is another story altogether the inclusion of child prodigies is another moin trope both chupke chupkes bespectacled muniba areesha shah and taana baanas quickwitted bilal yashraj have a clear predecessor in jibran the wizkid in moins ankahi 1982 though their characters arent half as nuanced as jibrans jibran is a wonder child whose physical disability has barred him from participating in outdoor activities and even school unlike other boys his age he is fully conscious of the fact but we never see him whine or complain his favourite pastime isnt a game of cricket but a book of history or classical poetry its not surprising then that he can quote off the top of his head a shakespeare or kahlil gibran who his family often jokingly equates him with for being his namesake add to it the fact that jibran has been raised among adults and the audience is convinced why hes matured beyond his physical years fun ensues from the audience realisation that jibran may be the wisest guy around and it is he who is seen adulting when most elders in the house are just kidding or clowning around advertisement more from entertainment emmys finally arrive
