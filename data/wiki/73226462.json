about people being mistreated at least not physically this is brutalist architecture from the french word for raw as in raw concrete beton brut the material favored by monsieur le corbusier a descendant of the modernist architectural movement of the early 20th century it produced hulking buildings that look like defensible fortresses such as the worthen bank building now bank of america at capitol and center streets in downtown little rock that towering monolith along with baptist medical center arkansas cancer research center at the university of arkansas for medical sciences and temple bnai israel were all designed by noland blass the modernist legacy of mr blass 19201998 was celebrated recently by gordon duckworth of little rock architectural firm wittenberg delony  davidson callie williams of the arkansas historic preservation program and mason toms of main street arkansas at a crowded gathering at the arkansas arts center mr blass a member of the little rock family that owned gus blass department store went to central high then cornell university where he earned a degree in architecture following service in the us army during world war ii he joined the little rock architectural firm of erhart eichenbaum and rauch by the early 1970s he was a senior partner along with corporate and institutional projects mr blass body of work includes residential designs many of which can be found along palisades and sunset drives with views of the arkansas river along with a unique curved house in wingate there are apartments too such as little rocks summit house and north little rocks lakewood house nolan liked to experiment not stick to one style said mason toms he was a driving force of midcentury architecture said callie williams and in his later years she added he liked taking on small projects so he could spend four months each year studying sculpture in san miguel de allende mexico mr blass was interested in reviving downtown his firm was a force behind the pedestrianfriendly metrocentre mall which broke ground in 1977 and lasted until around 1982 following the adage that you cant win em all he also participated in the design of the wilbur mills expressway built over a twodecade period beginning in 1965 that has since been blamed for significant social alterations in the city theres one social situation mr blass favored in his work according to mr toms his selfdesigned houses have large public spaces architects use as showplaces and they love to entertain those houses and their current residents continue to fulfill the function of bringing people together which led mr duckworth to lament the title of the evenings presentation wasnt people who live in blass houses now thats brutal editorial on 05132017 advertisement

that was far from the case referring to the brutalism ethic reyner banham noted one meant to reveal the messy realities of construction and building systems and to forge a new honesty about architecture and its role within the postwar eras broader social and urban transformationsbuildings tried to be rugged and direct kubo et al called brutalismheroic and an example of an eras ideals authentic and noble and dignified as i learn to appreciate beauty as also form and intent not just columns and cornices i see the authenticity nobility and dignity in the lamar law centerone that i hope is preserved as it is and not varnished over the heaviness of the building itself is elevated and lifted by the placement of the rooms with glass surrounds at the top of the anchoring corners call me a hopeless romantic but the lines and angles massive size embedded partially underground yet jutting out at heights seems symbolic of what the law is meant to bealbeit not always what it is what was the heroic authentic and noble purpose represented in the building design perhaps it was nothing more than the move to embrace a new urbanism brief though it was the important thing is ensuring the renovation keeps the character and integrity of the building in tact i cant imagine anything worse than a brutalist building with greek columns and red brick facade why repeat the cycle of destroying what we might appreciate with a longer historical lens cities should be layered with the intentions of different eras erasure is nearly always a mistake this slideshow requires

encountered this building in the late 1990s i thought what a terrible intrusion on campus but later in the 2000s when i actually got to spend some time inside and had a nice falllike day to stand outside and see how the light plays on the surface i began to understand a little more about brutalism and appreciate it a bit more i appreciated it even more when i looked around ole miss again and noticed how cheap and tawdry much of the new classical architecture ispiecedtogether dryvet columns porticos tacked onto every building that didnt move fast enough to get away etcand when compared to that kind of classicism the honesty and force of the lamar building is better appreciated theres a good set of photos of this building preconstruction tape and with interiors on the mdah database

december 4 2012  956 am enjoyed the photos and the jfd does have a similar approach lamar center was actually quite beautiful inside with wood panels that evoked images of the exterior windows and open glass walls from the upper floor that overlooked the atrium below not sure what they will do with that but i can imagine they wont waste much space with the dire need for classrooms and i just noted an oversight in attributing that last quotationit was kubo et al likelike reply  thomas rosell december 4 2012  1005 am thank you for bringing us this post kubo pasnik  grimley probably were referring to the common though often wholly appropriate understanding of the term brutalism the term coined by british architects alison and peter smithson in 1953 from the french béton brut or raw concrete a phrase used by le corbusier to describe the poured boardmarked concrete he had designed during the second world war where the building has something other than blank walls at the ground level it seems more engaging with trees around the building it looks very pleasant often brutalist buildings are plopped down on a wind swept plaza and look like a cross between a spaceship and a tribal ceremonial temple likelike reply  tom howorth december 4 2012  1011 am brava suzassippi for arguing on behalf of ole misss least favorite building despite its many flaws its perverse siting its leaky and porous envelope its inadequate and inflexible structure an argument can and should be made that buildings for higher education should stimulate the intellect rather than simply satisfy preconceptions and thereby lower expectations acknowledging that high brutalism is at its fashion nadir and that at its best it can literally abrade our humanity there are several fine examples where brutalist buildings have been terrifically redeemed and enhanced by contemporary interventions the best ive seen is leers wienzapfels metalandchannelglass expansion of jose luis serts precast concrete

myself referred to lamar as a hulking concrete bunker just last year nothing like some tutelage to help you see something in a different light likelike reply  thomas rosell december 4 2012  1046 am the yale art  architecture building is a great example of the idea of brutalism as repressive when the building was completed in 63 it was viewed by many as the heavy hand of the establishment the reaction to the structures repressiveness is believed to have been a possible reason for the firebombing of the rudolph building in 1969 talk about architectural crit likelike reply  suzassippi december 4 2012  138 pm time says in a 2008 article by richard lacayo that the theory of arson by disgruntled students who hated the building was wrongly suspected as it turns out mark alden branch 1998 says that no evidence was ever found to link students or even that the fire was arson the building that wont go away yale alumni magazine but that the stories seem to persist and at rudolphs death some journalists creatively inserted the burning was during a demonstration the fire was eventually ruled an accident by the new haven fire department likelike reply  thomas rosell december 4 2012  155 pm right i think the myth continues to perpetuate due to the brutalist appearance of the building because some would consider that reaction perfectly reasonable  believable likelike reply  suzassippi december 4 2012  549 pm well then they just have no sense of imagination  actually it was quite interesting reading the parallels between the praise for the building and rudolph in the beginning and the fall into disfavor for them both rudolph said in a 1988 interview that he rarely talked about the building because it was so painful to him likelike reply  beauregard rippy december

the etymology of brutalism above the term implies the expressive use of exposed structural concrete either castinplace or precast so while metrocenter may be brutal it is not brutalist likelike reply  thomas rosell december 5 2012  941 am i agree i dont think the metrocenter is brutalist its almost corbusian in that its a machine for shopping the use of raw concrete is certainly where the name brutalism was derived from but it might be possible to have a building that is brutilist in style that is not constructed of raw concrete some of the later buildings possibly lester walker talks about some brutalist structures in his book american homes brick concrete block and even roughcut wood siding can be used if the structure is designed with mass weight and solidity in mind likelike reply

suzassippi december 4 2012  555 pm the same architect designed the student union building on campus and while not brutalist it bears a similar appearance due to all the concrete and its quite utilitarian design still it has a presence about it and is only a block from the lamar building where it looks right at home likelike reply  tom howorth december 5 2012  1035 am the ole miss union building is brutalist due to its being of the period and because of its exposed expressed and expressive concrete its design was shall we say inspired by that of john desmonds lsu student union building which had won a gulf states regional aia honor award in 1965 the ole miss union was completed in 1977 see for yourself httpwwwlsueducampuslocationsuniohtml likelike reply  suzassippi december 5 2012  217 pm definitely can see the inspiration between the two when i read that the same architect had designed the student union building i thought it might be brutalist but the mdahhri database identifies it as new formalism are they related likelike reply  jennifer baughn december 5 2012  1029 pm we classified the union as new formalist because of its symmetrical massing and references to classical details in the monumental colonnade raised base and cornice with its exposed concrete it certainly has been influenced by brutalist methods but we believed that the stylistic qualities fell into the classical camp not the more abstract brutalist camp that said our stylistic terminology for the 1960s and 1970s is still evolving and certainly cant and shouldnt be considered gospel thanks

brutalist architecture which i have totally been absorbed in for 2 days my fondness for the lamar building as well as the union building stem simply from having had them a part of my daily life 20 years ago while i was an ole miss student as well as countless and subsequent visits especially in the last year as our son has now begun classes there these buildings while not as old or beloved as many others on campus are still a part of the landscape that is the university i come away from my readings on brutalist architecture with a lovehate relationship likelike reply  charles r harris

newlyenergized conversation around acceptable housing standards for students and the larger issue of addressing housing shortages munger hall has been criticized for its extremely high density nearly 4500 students in 168 million square feet lack of natural light 94 of the rooms would not have windows and jarring lack of harmony with its surroundings in addition it presents health and safety concerns and would have a potentially disastrous environmental impact in an area that suffers from recurring drought the discussion has led to a reevaluation of what is desirable acceptable and
