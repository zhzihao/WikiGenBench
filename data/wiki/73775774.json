{"id": 73775774, "key": "AEW Collision", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEW%20Collision", "text": "AEW Collision, also known as Saturday Night Collision or simply Collision, is an American professional wrestling television program produced by the American promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW). It airs live every Saturday at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on TNT, with some exceptions. The show premiered on June 17, 2023, and is positioned as their second main program behind Wednesday Night Dynamite, and third overall weekly program with Friday Night Rampage, which focuses on younger wrestlers in the company.\n\nThe show is AEW's second weekly professional wrestling program to currently air on TNT after Rampage (2021–present) and their third overall on TNT after Rampage and Dynamite, which aired on TNT from 2019 to 2021 before moving to TBS. This subsequently makes it the fourth overall wrestling show in general to air on TNT, after Dynamite, Rampage, and the former World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Monday Nitro (1995–2001), as well as the first Saturday night program on a Turner-owned network since the final episode of WCW Saturday Night on June 24, 2000.\n\nHistory\nOn February 15, 2023, the American professional wrestling promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) filed to trademark the name \"Collision\", hinting at a possible new in-ring television series in addition to their current programs, AEW Dynamite on TBS and AEW Rampage on TNT. Another trademark for the name was filed on April 28, leading to the belief that this would be the name of an upcoming Saturday TV show.\n\nOn May 17, 2023, AEW and broadcast partner Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced a third weekly television show titled AEW Collision to air live on TNT as a two-hour show on Saturdays starting June 17, 2023, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time (ET). This is AEW's second weekly professional wrestling program to currently air on TNT after Rampage and fourth overall wrestling show in general to air on TNT after Rampage, Dynamite (which aired on TNT from October 2019 to December 2021), and the former World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Monday Nitro (which aired on TNT from September 1995 to March 2001) and the first wrestling show on the Saturday night timeslot to air on a Turner-owned network since the end of WCW Saturday Night on August 19, 2000. It was also revealed that AEW's sister promotion, Ring of Honor (ROH), would move its tapings for ROH Honor Club TV to coincide with Collision, with ROH's show being taped after the live broadcast of Collision.\n\nIn preparation for the debut of Collision, AEW's YouTube programs, AEW Dark and AEW Dark: Elevation, were canceled. This was due to an amended deal with WBD, in which all of AEW's programs would air exclusively on their channels. It was also reported that Rampage would begin showcasing younger AEW wrestlers and unsigned independent wrestlers, essentially becoming what Dark and Elevation were for the company.\n\nPrior to the official announcement of Collision, there had been speculation that the inaugural episode would be held at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois. It was also speculated that it would feature the return of CM Punk, as the United Center is where Punk had made his AEW debut for the second episode of Rampage in August 2021. Since September 2022, Punk had been inactive due to both an injury and also a suspension as a result of the legitimate backstage altercation that occurred during the All Out post-event media scrum. Following the announcement of Collision, however, it was reported that there were still issues regarding Punk's return to the company, with WBD denying his involvement with the show, but on May 24, 2023, it was reported that the issues had been settled. AEW president Tony Khan then confirmed that the first episode would be held at the United Center, and feature the return of Punk to the company. Although Punk was brought back to be the centerpiece of the show, he would be released that September after another legitimate backstage altercation that occurred at All In London.\n\nIn speaking with the media on May 25 in promotion for AEW's Double or Nothing pay-per-view (PPV) that weekend, Khan clarified that Collision was not part of a new or extended deal with WBD, and instead, it was added on to their current contract, with AEW receiving a monetary increase from WBD for the show. Khan also confirmed that WBD reached out to AEW with the opportunity for another show, and that it was WBD's Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav's idea for there to be more AEW content on TNT. It had also been speculated that with the addition of Collision, AEW would do some form of a roster split, similar to WWE's brand extension, in which half of the roster would perform exclusively on Dynamite while the other half would exclusively appear on Collision. In an appearance on the Barstool Rasslin''' podcast on June 13, Khan said that there would not be a hard split where wrestlers would exclusively appear on only one program. Instead, he said some wrestlers would be featured exclusively on certain shows for a certain period of time, but there could be opportunities for storylines to cross between Dynamite and Collision. He also confirmed that all AEW champions would continue to appear on all AEW programming.\n\nOn June 16, a day before Collisions debut, Khan confirmed that the show's commentary team would consist of Kevin Kelly and Nigel McGuinness, with Jim Ross occasionally sitting in on main events.\n\nBeginning with the August 5, 2023, episode, Collision airs against WWE's monthly pay-per-views, which are typically held on Saturdays at 8 p.m ET, starting with SummerSlam. Additionally, due to AEW's pay-per-view Full Gear being held on Saturday, November 18, 2023, that weekend's episode of Collision will instead be held the night before on Friday, November 17 at 8 p.m. ET, putting it head-to-head against WWE's Friday night program, SmackDown.\n\n Special episodes \n\nRoster\n\nThe wrestlers featured on AEW Collision'' take part in scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers are portrayed as heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match.\n\nCommentators\n\nRing announcers\n\nSee also\n\nList of professional wrestling television series\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nCollision\n2023 American television series debuts\n2020s American television series\nAmerican live television series\nAmerican professional wrestling television series\nEnglish-language television shows\nTNT (American TV network) original programming", "unikey": "AEW Collision", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["History", "Special_episodes", "Roster", "See_also", "Notes", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["On February 15, 2023, the Americanprofessional wrestlingpromotionAll Elite Wrestling(AEW) filed to trademark the name \"Collision\", hinting at a possible new in-ring television series in addition to their current programs,AEW DynamiteonTBSandAEW RampageonTNT.Another trademark for the name was filed on April 28, leading to the belief that this would be the name of an upcoming Saturday TV show.\nOn May 17, 2023, AEW and broadcast partnerWarner Bros.
