{"id": 75051089, "key": "Complementary football", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary%20football", "text": "Complementary football is a theory in American football that states the performance, or lack thereof, in one of the three phases of the game by a team can subsequently alter the game's flow in the following possessions, so the three units of the team must operate in synergy as a collective for the best chance to win.\n\nHistory and use of the term \nThe idea of 'complementary football' is a broad, obvious, conceit of the sport, and there is no inventor, in the traditional sense, of the concept. The usage of the term, in this context, is often used by coaches who coached within the coaching tree of Bill Belichick, and, by virtue, the Bill Parcells coaching tree.\n\nTedy Bruschi, formerly of the New England Patriots gave an example using an excerpt of the October 23, 2015, game between the (Belichick-led) Patriots and New York Jets.\n\nHow the Patriots scored their first touchdown Sunday was a result of complementary football. It started with a punt early in the second quarter, as the team was already trailing 10-3.\n\nRyan Allen's punt was a good one, with Jeremy Kerley calling for a fair catch at the Jets' 8-yard line.\n\nThe Jets then ran for 2 yards on first down, and then 6 yards on second down. On a critical third-and-2, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick's pass to receiver Brandon Marshall to the left sideline was incomplete.\n\nThat forced a Steve Weatherford punt, and it wasn't a very good one -- 31 yards.\n\nThe Patriots took over at the Jets' 47-yard line, so with the offense not even being on the field, they end up seven yards ahead of where they were on the previous drive.\n\nReceiver Danny Amendola's 8-yard catch on third-and-7 was a critical play, as he caught the ball short of the sticks but ducked under safety Marcus Gilchrist, then surged ahead for the first down.\n\nThen Amendola stayed hot with a 23-yard catch over the middle, setting the stage for Tom Brady's 11-yard scramble on third-and-10 to keep the drive alive. It ended with Brady's 1-yard leaping sneak for a touchdown in which he reached the ball over the goal line.\n\nWhen you look back on the sequence, all of it was made possible due to the execution of the punt team doing its job. Then it took the defense producing a three-and-out, setting the stage for the offense to take over possession seven yards ahead of where they ended the previous drive.\n\nThat is the essence of complementary football.Prior to the establishment of the term in pop football lexicon in recent years, Bill Parcells, mentor of Belichick during time with the New York Giants and New York Jets, had his 1997–1999 Jets (where Belichick served as his assistant head coach and defensive coordinator) teams described as operating under \"the theory of complementary offense and defense\" and Parcells would state that his teams would need to \"play [good teams] in a complementary fashion\".\n\nParcells first served on a coaching staff with Bill Belichick on the 1979 New York Giants, Parcells as linebackers coach, Belichick as a special teams and defensive assistant. Belichick would assume Parcells's vacated role in 1980 as Parcells accepted the same position with the Patriots, but Parcells would return the following year, serving as defensive coordinator and sharing linebacker coaching duties with Belichick, until his assumption of the role of head coach in 1983. Belichick would then assume the role of defensive coordinator with the Giants from 1985 to 1990. Belichick would reunite with Parcells as his assistant head coach in 1996 with the New England Patriots, in addition to his stint under Parcells with the New York Jets, before the Patriots would hire Belichick as their head coach in 2000.\n\nIowa Hawkeyes head coach Kirk Ferentz, who served under Belichick as his offensive line coach with the Cleveland Browns from 1993 to 1996, is a similarly long-term proponent of the theory.\n\nFerentz is on record as being \"[appreciative] for how punters can affect and impact the game\"; an example of Ferentz's application and understanding of the strategy within the special teams realm.\n\nThis conceptual idea has seen an increase in popular interest and awareness due to its invocation by Iowa Hawkeyes offensive coordinator Brian Ferentz, also a proponent of the theory, amidst the Hawkeyes' offensive struggles and allegations of nepotism. Ahead of a season in which the Hawkeyes' defense would concede the second–fewest points while the offense, inversely, would score the third–fewest, in July 2022, Ferentz said:“Look at the worst defenses in the league. How often does it correlate with one of the better offenses in the league? More than you think. You just have to know who you are. You have to play complementary football.”Prior to working under his father at Iowa, Brian also served under Belichick, from 2008 to 2011 on the Patriots staff as an offensive quality control coach for the first two seasons and for his final season as the tight ends coach.\n\nCharlie Weis, who worked with, and for, Belichick in various capacities from 1996 to 2004, has spoken of \"complementary gameplans\" in 2007 as head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and in 2014 as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks.\n\nTodd Haley and Josh McDaniels have referenced and been referenced with the strategy (usually in passing). Haley worked on the New York Jets coaching staff from 1997 to 1999 as the wide receivers coach while Belichick served as assistant head coach and defensive coordinator. Haley's father, Dick, served as director of player personnel and led draft planning during these same years. McDaniels served under Belichick initially between 2001 and 2008, and again between 2012 and 2021, serving as offensive coordinator for the entire second stint, as well as 2006–2008 during his first stint.\n\nBill O'Brien, who worked for Belichick with the Patriots between 2007 and 2011 in a myriad of positions (including holding the offensive coordinator title for the 2011 season), used the term frequently as head coach with the Penn State Nittany Lions and Houston Texans.\n\nUnder Mike Zimmer, starting in 2018, it was noted that the Minnesota Vikings referred to operating in harmony on offense, defense, and special teams as \"complementary football\". Zimmer served as defensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys from 2000 to 2006, and from 2003 to 2006 served under head coach Bill Parcells.\n\nThe term has seen an increase in frequency of use to describe this strategic line of thinking in recent years across a broader spectrum of football players, coaches, and writers.\n\nReferences \n\nAmerican football strategy\nAmerican football terminology", "unikey": "Complementary football", "summary": "Complementary football is a theory in American football that states the performance, or lack thereof, in one of the three phases of the game by a team can subsequently alter the game's flow in the following possessions, so the three units of the team must operate in synergy as a collective for the best chance to win.\n", "outlines": ["History_and_use_of_the_term", "References"], "contents": ["The idea of 'complementary football' is a broad, obvious, conceit of the sport, and there is no inventor, in the traditional sense, of the concept.

top of the covid19 pandemic and a prematurely canceled football season in june 2020 more than five dozen allegations of racial insensitivity levied by black former players spawned a summerlong investigation it cost strength coach chris doyle his job and there was uncertainty about how the team would respondafter its 02 start iowa coalesced as a team the hawkeyes rattled off six consecutive victories to close the regular season including five by double digits they dispatched michigan state 497 minnesota 357 and wisconsin 287 plus had a 4121 win at penn statethe hawkeyes boasted the nations best stoprate defense led the country in yards allowed per play and were second among power 5 programs in points allowed per game 160 although the passing game was inconsistent quarterback spencer petras threw nine touchdowns and only two interceptions during the winning streak the running game averaged 46 yards per carry a program high since 2008 iowas 318 pointspergame average was second best among big ten teams its the only time in the kirk ferentz era that iowa scored more than 17 points in every gamebehind big ten defensive player of the year daviyon nixon and future allamerica linebacker jack campbell iowa was capable of competing with any team shy of alabama but it never got the chance a 2120 loss to northwestern in week 2 cost iowa the west division title a shot at ohio state and perhaps a college football playoff berth it was a game iowa led 170 in the first quarter at empty kinnick stadium and it was loaded with missed opportunitiesadvertisementthere was ample criticism of brian ferentzs game plan that day iowa totaled 23 carries for 77 rushing yards but ran only 16 times for 52 yards after the first quarter petras was making his second start but it was against a veteran defense led by a coordinator who had frustrated iowa for 15 yearswhen theyre veteran theyre very difficult to fucking run the ball against ferentz said they do a great job of playing a twohigh safety defense well they have extra guys in the run fit the only thing ultimately that they respect  and they dont even respect it  but theyre daring you to throw the ball over their heads thats just how they playnorthwesterns linebacker duo of paddy fisher and blake gallagher was among the nations best the wildcats base defense is similar to how iowa plays with a 43 front and a zone coverage scheme it was as disciplined as it was toughthree plays kept iowa from winning the first was an incomplete pass that led to a field goal the second was a 52yard field goal try into the wind that bounced off the right upright the third was an interception midway through the fourth quarterwith the hawkeyes leading 140 they drove from their 36 to the northwestern 3yard line and faced thirdand2 matching iowas heavy personnel  two tight ends and a fullback  the wildcats lined up in their goalline defense at the snap petras faked a left outside zone and booted to the right side receiver nico ragaini slid underneath the line of scrimmage to the right flat right tight end shaun beyer took four steps forward and turned toward the sidelinethe wildcats were disheveled two defenders went with ragaini and none even touched beyer by his third step before petras even carried out his fake beyer was by himself it was perfect except for one northwestern defender end adetomiwa adebawore at the snap adebawore raced inside his gap didnt follow iowas running back and nearly hit ragaini instead of giving the receiver a chuck adebawore recognized the bootleg action and attacked petras by the time petras peeled around adebawore was in the quarterbacks face off balance petras threw the ball without steam or air and the pass fell well short and wide of beyerthis is the play that lost the game ferentz said we should have hit this for a touchdown if ifs and buts were candies and nuts right but watch its the biggest play in the game theyre talking to the cover guys what the fuck are you guys doing pointing right at beyer and nobodys covering look thats football that shit happensadvertisementthe missed field goal came at the end of a solid twominute drive during which petras led the offense from his 25 to the northwestern 34 with only two seconds left in the half but the games most enduring play took place with seven minutes leftwith the wildcats leading 2120 iowa safety jack koerner picked off a pass and the hawkeyes took over at the northwestern 36 a 9yard run on an inside zone gave iowa secondand1 at the 27 on the next play gallagher beat a block and recorded a 3yard loss facing thirdand4 at the 30 ferentz elected for 21 personnel two backs two receivers one tight end and lined up petras in the shotgunanything but a turnover would have set up a fieldgoal attempt for the 2019 firstteam allamerica kicker keith duncan the way both offenses had struggled the points likely hold up but another first down would have chipped away at the clock and given duncan a higherpercentage attemptpetras had struggled after a stellar first quarter during which he completed 9of12 passes for 86 yards during the final three quarters he was 17of39 passing with three interceptions and 130 yards during the review ferentz was asked why he didnt call more running plays after the 3yard loss he muttered heres one of those runs you want me to call more ofi dont know that id change my thinking because part of it is knowing that the run game is not going to be what you want it to be today ferentz said in reflection if i had my druthers wed just hand it off about 65 times a game honestly that would really piss people off but its the easiest way to win thats why youre trying to build everything around it thats why playing these guys is such a fucking nightmare or iowa state theyre going to be very hard to run the ball against because now theyre daring you to throw it over their headsfor a play taking barely four seconds from snap to interception ferentz needed more than 45 minutes to break it down conceptually its both complex and easy to absorb split end brandon smith lined up to petras left and ran an 8yard hitch against a single defender ferentz called this a gift route meaning if the ball is thrown correctly and on time theres no way to stop it but if its late or poorly thrown its dangerous without hesitation petras would rifle that ball there this year but not on oct 31 2020the only guy that can take this away is the flat defender ferentz said what were letting these guys do right now is give us the illusion of the flat being covered this guy safety brandon joseph cannot make that play cannot make this play if this ball is thrown on time he hits this on five stretch plant and throw the cornerback has no chance of making this play not in a million fucking yearsadvertisementwere probably not the only team thats been scared of that shit but were done because petras arm strength is too much like his greatest attribute is being wasted right here because theyre not covering this guy and were letting them talk us into it that wont happen anymorethe route concept is what ferentz calls a pure progression read all five eligible receivers are running patterns theres stress applied to both the boundary flat on a shallow cross by receiver ihmir smithmarsette and to the field flat with both running backs the other route by tight end sam laporta is called otb which stands for over the ballbut theres a time element in a fivestep drop for petras if he doesnt like the gift he must narrow his options and process the information quickly theres not enough time to dissect all five options in order ferentz said the read is gift smith threat smithmarsette intent laporta and outlet tyler goodson or mekhi sargent smithmarsette was covered so closely there was nothing to gain from a pass in his directionagainst northwesterns quarters coverage laporta broke open just as petras hit the final step of his drop and hitched upward petras fired into an opening but laporta got one hand on the ball it hung up just enough in the air for joseph to swoop over and pick it offwhen the play was graded petras picked up minuses for the decision and timing and pluses for his drop and the ball location the hitch route was open and easy and he was late on the throw but it was at the correct spot and laporta could have caught the ballthis sucks ferentz said this is just not fun to watchtop photo scott dochterman  the athletic get allaccess to exclusive storiessubscribe to the athletic for indepth coverage of your

call with referee ron winter during the second quarter of an nfl football game against the san diego chargers sunday nov 22 2009 in denver ap photochris schneiderap  fr170036 ap if in some way it can derail history then it is what it is the broncos have busted out of their slump with backtoback wins over the giants and chiefs whom they outscored by a combined 7019 those wins vaulted them to the top of the wild card race in the afc where theyre looking down on the likes of baltimore and pittsburgh two teams that manhandled them a month ago so the team that shows up at lucas oil stadium on sunday should have a bit of a swagger it just wont match indys strut in extolling the colts many talents monday mcdaniels painted a picture that even the most diehard of broncos fans will have a hard time sifting through to find slivers of hope this is a very talented team that doesnt make mistakes very wellcoached great organization mcdaniels began ive had an opportunity to play against them a number of times at new england and its always been a great challenge to get ready for them where to start the offense of peyton manning and their ability to throw the ball and score a lot of points certainly poses a huge challenge mcdaniels said defensively i think theyre leading the league in points allowed they get to the quarterback mcdaniels saved his most effusive praise for the colts special teams theyre fast they do a great job of kicking the ball they return the ball well they cover well they got great speed he said this is to me the ultimate complementary football team they get ahead of you and then they send the rushers at you and they dont give up many big plays on defense which forces you to go a long distance and run a lot of plays to score on them controlling the clock is no antidote either consider on sept 21 manning spent most of the night on the sideline but made the most of his chances in leading the colts to a 2723 win at miami the colts had the ball for only 1453 the lowest time of possession for a winning team in the nfl since 1977 they ran 35 plays to 84 for the dolphins it doesnt take them long to make big plays mcdaniels said and in this era of parity the colts are a throwback to a time when the nfl was like college football where the rich get richer they have one of the best receivers in all of football in reggie wayne they have one of the best tight ends in football in dallas clark they have one the best quarterbacks in football in peyton manning i could go on and on mcdaniels said and theyre not even playing with injured safety bob sanders the broncos wouldnt seem to have a chance against such a stacked deck then again who thought back in the summer that the broncos would go 60 or have a shot at 124 were peaking at the right time running back correll buckhalter said after rumbling for 113 yards on just a dozen carries in the broncos 4413 whipping of the chiefs at kansas city on sunday you want to start peaking in december in order to have a chance to do it in the playoffs and thats what were doing rookie knowshon moreno who scored twice sunday has averaged 90 yards on the ground over the last month finally putting up numbers befitting the top running back selected in the nfl draft that twoheaded monster in the backfield they are running pretty hard receiver brandon marshall said the broncos piled up 245 yards on the ground at kansas city and also scored four tds in six trips inside the 20 which has been their achilles heel all year will the good vibes resonate into next week well i hope so quarterback kyle orton said thats two good weeks in a row that weve put it together on offense i think as a team we played well for two weeks in a row and hopefully we can continue that momentum against a team that

asnyderpennlivecomview full sizejoe hermitt the patriotnewspenn state coach bill obrien and quarterback matt mcgloin have developed quite a chemistry over the nittany lions decision to go for it on fourth downsince the night his airplane touched down at university park airport everything about bill obriens first head coaching job has been a tossupwhen he first met with the team during a chilly january night he had a full roster complete with a 1200yard running back who was eager to jump on boardplayers raved about having the opportunity to learn a prostyle offense and found the 42yearold coach willing and able to relate to his roster full of 18 through 20somethings this was the man who coached nfl star tom brady and worked under nfl master mind bill belichickobrien couldnt have predicted that his first season at penn state would take a drastic turn when the ncaa stepped in and handed down sanctions so harsh that his players would be banned from postseason play for four years and can still leave the program without penalty until training camp begins next augustmore penn states fourth down efficiency by the numbers as some players left and others pledged their commitment to the school and to the program obrien continued working with what he hadhalfway through the season fans are learning that what obrien has on the field and what he has up his sleeve are two different thingsthrough six games the nittany lions have taken many by surprise not only with their efficiency on offense and the maturation of quarterback matt mcgloin but with their willingness to attempt fourthdown conversionsthe lions have converted 14 of 21 fourth downs the most attempts and conversions in the country its a number so startling to those in the football world that obriens risk taking is worth a second lookcoach obrien shows that he has confidence in us and we have confidence in him wide receiver allen robinson said that definitely brings a lot to the table for the offense we look at the fourth down as a redeem play if we do not get a lot on the first down or the second down then we can make it up on fourth down if coach chooses to go for itrobinsons enthusiasm about going for it on fourth down is matched by his teammates whose eyes light up when asked to talk about obriens strategy its an unconventional strategy but they practice executing the plays and so far its worked in their favorrobinson has fared well on fourth downs too catching two touchdown passes from mcgloin robinsons 41yard touchdown catch on a fourthand5 play in the first quarter against temple put penn state on the scoreboard first the receivers 6yard touchdown catch on a fourthand4 play late in the fourth quarter against northwestern showed obriens trust in his playersrather than bringing kicker sam ficken on to attempt a field goal and make it a onepossession game obrien trusted mcgloin would make the right decision and let his quarterback find robinson in the end zonemuch of obriens fourthdown strategy is attributed to his team being shorthanded with specialists ficken is 3for9 on field goal attempts this season however even before ficken missed a field goal during his fourmiss game at virginia obriens team had attempted five fourthdown conversionsits success on those earlyseason conversions the team was 4for5 before fickens first missed field goal a 40yard attempt midway through the first quarter against the cavaliersa lot of times it has worked out this year where its been about field position obrien said i dont think you see me going for it on fourth down backed up inside our own 20 or really inside our side of the 50i might have done it a few times but not too often usually if we have the right field position and were out of fickens range it might be better to have a good play especially if its a manageable fourth downobrien has opted to go for it four times with his team either at the 50yard line or backed up on its side of the 50 three of those instances came in the game against virginia the first one a fourthand10 play from the psu 11yard line was late in the fourth quarter while trailing ohio 2414penn states 21 fourthdown conversion attempts are even more startling when looking at the rest of the big ten the nittany lions 14 conversions are more than any other conference foe had attempted heading into saturdays games illinois 11 attempts were the closestperhaps its belichicks risktaking ways that rubbed off of obrien however even in the nfl this season heading into week 6 there wasnt a team that had attempted more than seven fourthdown conversions the cincinnati bengals and seattle seahawks are 5of7 and 3of7 respectivelyeven all four teams in the afc east combined barely have half as many attempts as penn state does through six games the patriots jets bills and dolphins together are 6of11 on fourthdown conversions belichicks patriots are 0for1while no other team in the country is faced with the same challenge as penn state in regard to having players able to leave and the team not having any postseason opportunities obriens hands are tied with that issuethe group of players he and his staff inherited is what they have to work with sure hed like to have a more consistent kicker and a punter who averages more than 365 yards per kick but its all part of doing the best with what he hashis players have taken a liking to this message as wellwere going to do whats best for this offense and whats best for the team at that time said mcgloin who has accounted for 10 of the successful fourthdown conversions seven with his arm and three with his legs if thats going nohuddle or running it or passing it or doing whatever then were going to do it and were going to do it successfullya big part of obriens coaching strategy revolves around what he calls complementary football this is the idea that each area offense defense and special teams feeds off of the others if the defense forces a threeandout and then special teams give the offense good starting field position then obriens team is playing complementary football this theory carries over to his play callingits not that hard on a play caller because your thirddown call is like a seconddown call when you know youre going to go for it obrien said its not like all of a sudden you say were going to go for it its a thoughtout deal and hopefully we continue to execute on fourth down i think weve done a decent job on it this yearlooking at the last decade of penn state football obriens willingness to convert fourth downs is anything but typical last season the lions had 18 attempts through 13 games and converted 10 of those those 18 attempts were uncharacteristically high for a team that attempted at least 15 fourthdown conversions just twice since the 2002 seasonit is a lot different than previously running back zach zwinak said not every coach goes for it on fourth down but coach obrien likes to go for it and if he thinks we can get it we can get it it comes down to when we talk to each other in the huddle and were like we can get this just push hard the guys come out and we make a playthe beauty of this strategy is that obrien isnt simply proceeding with reckless abandon the longest conversion the team has attempted was a fourthand12 against navy mcgloin hit freshman receiver trevor williams with a 24yard pass before the drive stalled at the navy 8yard linepenn states average distance on the fourthdown conversions is just a tad more than 4 yards the 401 yard average is manageable enough for obriens offense especially considering there isnt a true range for ficken field goalshowever standing on the sidelines while the offense stays on the field for the attempt hasnt become any easier for the defensewere about to have a heat attack linebacker michael mauti said that offense with coach obrien has everyone on the edge  it really comes down to guys taking control and making the plays when they get the ball and doing whatever it takes that has been our motto all year whatever it takes guys knowing their roles and doing their job and stepping upso far it looks as if obrien too has found a way to step up and do whatever it takes to move the chainsif you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site we may receive compensation by using this site you consent to our user agreement

conference play on saturday with a 3714 loss to villanova at truist stadium head coach vincent brown expressed the immediate need for the aggies passing game to improve the aggies posted 64 yards passing against the wildcats including seven in the first half the aggies have yet to throw for 100 yards this season the inability to move the chains has tilted the time of possession advantage heavily in the favor of ats opponents the aggies 14 only had eight first downs against the wildcats and they kept the ball only 6 ½ minutes in the first half seven yards passing in the first half puts tremendous stress on your offense and your entire defense said brown being unable to run the football is very challenging overall it is not even remotely good enough for us to be competitive in the conference we have to find a way offensively to produce points we have to find a way offensively to pass the football it has been the same story all season long were going to get it fixed despite ats offense only touching the field briefly in the first half the aggies had a firsthalf lead thanks to allconference kickoff returner taymon cooke cooke returned his second kickoff for a touchdown this season with a 94yard return in the first quarter to give at a 73 lead it marked cookes third kickoff return for a touchdown in his career cooke leads the nation in kickoff returns for touchdowns and yards per kickoff return 389 villanova recaptured the lead two minutes later when wildcat quarterback connor watkins found receiver jaylen sanchez standing by himself at the at 30yard line on a long pass sanchez did the rest scoring on a 58yard touchdown reception to give the wildcats a 107 lead after a matthew mercurio 39yard field goal extended the wildcats lead to six the aggies used a solid punt return and the legs of true freshman quarterback kevin white to recapture the lead sophomore punt returner elijah kennedy returned a nathan fondacaro punt 11 yards to the wildcat 33 to give the aggies a 1stand10 two plays later white scrambled to his right and avoided two villanova defenders before retracing his considerably fast steps back to the left before sprinting to the end zone in an amazing showcase of his speed to score on a 25yard touchdown the third of his short career at at whites sprint gave the aggies a 1413 lead with 1027 remaining in the first half based on his performance last week we felt like he would give us the best chance this week brown said about white he demonstrates some things from a skill set standpoint that can be really hard to defend because he is such a great runner we have to be creative in structuring things to take advantage of what he does best despite whites efforts the wildcats would use the final 10 minutes of the first half to build a solid lead villanova responded to the aggies scoring drive by putting together a 9play 85yard drive that chewed away 5 ½ minutes off the clock as deewil barlee scored on a 21yard touchdown run ats ensuing drive stalled and the wildcats took over the ball again with 245 remaining in the half it took the wildcats a little more than a minute to go 62 yards in seven plays to score again as watkins found rayjuon pringle in the corner of the end zone for a 9yard touchdown pass giving the wildcats a 2714 advantage the wildcats then used an onside kick to get the ball back and score on a mercurio 19yard field goal to head into the locker room with a 3014 lead it was very encouraging to be able to return one for a touchdown but it was also very discouraging to give them another possession on kickoff return when we were hopefully getting ready to try to put something together offensively complementary football is the only way to win consistently the aggies could not muster much of a response in the second half they did not convert a third down in the second half going 0for6 sophomore running back kenji christian led the aggies offensively rushing for 64 yards on 11 carries white completed 8 of 17 passes for 64 yards with 52 of those yards going to tight end nicholas dobson who had four receptions freshman linebacker kade moledor led the aggies with his firstcareer doublefigure tackle game as he posted 11 including seven unassisted avarion cole had nine tackles including one for loss and he broke up a pass graduate bj turner finished with eight tackles including two for loss i cant get into specifics here but there are things that we know we can do to help our offense and were going to do those things said brown we have to play complementary football the offense has to do its part to move the ball and to produce points defensively we must stop them and give the offense the ball back and then the kicking game has to be a major factor print
