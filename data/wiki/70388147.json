According to Jewish tradition the book was attributed to the prophet Samuel, but modern scholars view it as part of the Deuteronomistic History, which spans in the books of Deuteronomy to 2 Kings, attributed to nationalistic and devotedly Yahwistic writers during the time of the reformer Judean king Josiah in 7th century BCE. This chapter records the activities of judges Samson. belonging to a section comprising Judges 13 to 16 and Judges 6:1 to 16:31.\n\nText\nThis chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language. It is divided into 20 verses.\n\nTextual witnesses\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).\n\nExtant ancient manuscripts of a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint (originally was made in the last few centuries BCE) include Codex Vaticanus (B; B; 4th century) and Codex Alexandrinus (A; A; 5th century).\n\nAnalysis\n\nTwo panels\nA linguistic study by Chisholm reveals that the central part in the Book of Judges (Judges 3:7–16:31) can be divided into two panels based on the six refrains that state that the Israelites did evil in Yahweh's eyes:\n\nPanel One\n A 3:7 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the  (KJV)\n B 3:12 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the \nB 4:1 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the \n\nPanel Two\nA 6:1 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the  \nB 10:6 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the \nB 13:1 \nAnd the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the \n\nFurthermore, from the linguistic evidence, the verbs used to describe the Lord's response to Israel's sin have chiastic patterns and can be grouped to fit the division above:\n\nPanel One\n3:8 , “and he sold them,” from the root , \n3:12 , “and he strengthened,” from the root , \n4:2 , “and he sold them,” from the root , \n\nPanel Two\n6:1 , “and he gave them,” from the root , \n10:7 , “and he sold them,” from the root , \n13:1 , “and he gave them,” from the root ,\n\nThe Samson Narrative\nChapters 13–16 contains the \"Samson Narrative\" or \"Samson Cycle\", a highly structured poetic composition with an 'almost architectonic tightness' from a literary point-of-view. The entire section consists of 3 cantos and 10 subcantos and 30 canticles, as follows:\n Canto I : the birth story of Samson (Judges 13:2–25)\n Canto II : the feats of Samson in Timnah and Judah (Judges 14:1–16:3)\n Canto III : Samson's exploits in the Valley of Sorek and the temple of Dagon (Judges 16:4–31).\n\nThe distribution of the 10 subcantos into 3 cantos is a regular 2 + 4 + 4, with the number of canticles per subcanto as follows:\n Canto I: 3 + 3\n Canto II: 3 + 3 + 3 + 5 (3 + 2?)\n Canto III: 2 + 2 + 3 + 3\n\nThe number of strophes per canticle in each canto is quite uniform with numerical patterns in Canto II showing a 'concentric symmetry':\n Canto I:  4 + 4 + 4 | 4 + 4 + 4\n Canto Ila:  4 + 3 + 3 | 4 + 4 + 4  | 3 + 3 + 4 (concentric)\n Canto IIb: 4 + 4 + 3 + 4? + 4     (concentric)\n Canto III:  4 + 4  | 4 + 4  | 4 + 4 + 4  | 3 + 3 + 4\n\nThe structure regularity within the whole section classifies this composition as a 'narrative poetry' or 'poetic narrative'.\n\nBesides the thematic symmetry, parts of the narrative shows an observable structure with chapter 13 balances chapter 16 (each consisting of three sub-sections with a fourfold asking and answer discourse at the center) whereas chapters 14 and 15 show a parallelism in form and content.\n\nStructure of chapter 14\nChapter 14 has the following structure:\n A. Samson went down to Timnah (14:1-4)\n1. speech between Samson and parents/father\n2. parental objection\n3. Samson's rejection of the possibility of another woman.\n B. Samson went down  to Timnah (14:5-6)\n1. action involving an animal (lion).\n C. And he went down  and spoke to the woman (14:7-9) \n1. action involving honey, a gracious act\n D. His father went down to the woman (14:10-20) \n1. speech between Samson, Philistines and the Timnite;\n2. Philistines threaten third party to beat Samson\n3. Spirit of YHWH and Samson's victory.\n\nSamson wants to marry a Philistine woman (14:1–4)\nThe power struggles between Samson and the Philistines stem from the incident recorded in verses 1–4 of this chapter that starts with Samson \"going down\" to Timnah and \"seeing\" an attractive Philistine woman. Themes of Israelite status and the otherness of the Philistines ( 'us' versus 'them') are displayed in a tale of trickery and counter-trickery as God uses Samson to challenge the Philistines who 'rule over Israel at this time' (14:4). These themes are shown in the parental disapproving words to Samson concerning his chosen match (14:3; cf. Genesis 34:14—15) and in the ethnic way Samson describing the woman.\n\nVerse 1\nAnd Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.\n\"Timnath\" or \"Timnah\": now \"Tel el-Baṭashi) located about  west of Zorah and Eshtaol, on the southern side of the Valley of Sorek. Judges 1:34 notes that the Danites (Samson's tribe) failed to occupy the coastal plain and was confined to the hills, so from this higher ground, Samson \"went down\" to Timnah which was a Philistine town.\n\nSamson's wedding and riddle (14:5–20)\n\n|The killing of the lion with bare hands (verse 5) was kept secret (cf. verse 9) and led to the idden answer to the riddle that follows (verse 14). This episode gives a portrayal Samson with a superpower which is followed superhuman feats against the Philistines (cf. 15:1,4; 16:1,3; 16:4, 9,12,14).  The honey in the lion's carcass acts as a source of nourishment for a warrior (verse 8; cf.  honey and Jonathan in 1 Samuel 14:27–29). The seven-day wedding feast between Samson and the Timnite woman becomes an occasion for trickery, as a possible union between opposing groups turned to resentment and destruction (ultimately God's plan for the Philistines, oppressors of Israel), where Samson is clearly an outsider surrounded by Philistines, and either side plays fair. In this chapter forward, the pattern of knowledge, deception, sexuality, and power intertwine in the Samson Narrative. Samson paid the loss of his riddling bet by killing thirty Philistines from another Philistine city, Ascalon, and gave the clothes to  his riddle opponents in Timnath, but he immediately went back to his own people and did not consummate his marriage, so his father-in-law gave Samson's bride to another man, which becomes a set up for the fissure between Samson and the Philistines.\n\nThe center section of the riddle (verses 14–17) has a concentric symmetry highlighted by the words \"tell\" and \"riddle\" as follows:\nA. Report\n1. They could not \"tell\" the \"riddle\" for three days\n2. On the seventh day, they approached the wife\nB. The Philistines' speech\n\"Entice your husband to \"tell\" the \"riddle\"\nX. Speech of Samson's bride\n\"You hate me, you do not love me,\nYou possed the \"riddle\" to my people\nto me you did not \"tell\"\nB'. Samson's speech\n\"I did not \"tell\" my father and mother\nShall I \"tell\" you?\nA.' Report\n2'. She wept for seven days\n1'. On the seventh day, he \"told\" her\nand she \"told\" the \"riddle\" to her people\n\nThe riddle itself was given with a high artistry of word play (verse 14), taking the three possible meaning of the root \"'ry\" (to \"eat\", \"lion\", or \"honey\") that the correct answer to the riddle would be \"\"ri mē ri\" (\"honey from lion\"). However, the Philistines avoided to give that answer which would betray their source of knowledge, and instead gave a counter-riddle as an answer: \"What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?\" that the answer would be \"love\".\n\nArcheology\nA circular stone seal, approximately  in diameter, was found by the archaeologists from Tel Aviv University (announced in August 2012) on the floor of a house at Beth Shemesh and appears to depict a long-haired man slaying a lion, which may or may not depict the biblical Samson. The 12th-century-BCE seal was discovered in the geographical proximity to the area where Samson lived, and the time period of the seal indicates that a story was being told at the time of a hero who fought a lion, and that the story eventually found its way into the biblical text and onto the seal.\n\nSee also\n\nRelated Bible parts: Judges 13, Judges 15, Judges 16, Hebrews 11\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n Jewish translations:\n Shoftim - Judges - Chapter 14 (Judaica Press).

swete and a few other scholars use the letter s a greek manuscript of the old and new testaments of the greatest antiquity and value found on mount sinai in st catherines monastery by constantine tischendorf he was visiting there in 1844 under the patronage of frederick augustus king of saxony when he discovered in a rubbish basket fortythree leaves of the septuagint containing portions of i par chron jer neh and esther he was permitted to take them he also saw the books of isaias and i and iv machabees belonging to the same codex as the fragments but could not obtain possession of them warning the monks of their value he left for europe and two years later published the leaves he had brought with him under the name of codex fridericoaugustanus after his patron they are preserved at leipzig on a second visit in 1853 he found only two short fragments of genesis which he printed on his return and could learn nothing of the rest of the codex in 1859 he made a third visit this time under the patronage of the czar alexander ii this visit seemed likewise fruitless when on the eve of his departure in a chance conversation with the steward he learned of the existence of a manuscript there when it was shown to him he saw the very manuscript he had sought containing beyond all his dreams a great part of the old testament and the entire new testament besides the epistle of barnabas and part of the shepherd of hermas of which two works no copies in the original greek were known to exist thinking it a crime to sleep tischendorf spent the night copying barnabas he had to leave in the morning after failing to persuade the monks to let him have the manuscript at cairo he stopped at a monastery belonging to the same monks they were of the orthodox greek church and succeeded i having the manuscript sent to him there for transcription and finally in obtaining it from the monks as a present to the czar tischendorfs patron and the protector of their church years later in 1869 the czar rewarded the two monasteries with gifts of money 7000 and 2000 roubles each and decorations the manuscript is treasured in the imperial library at st petersburg tischendorf published an account of it in 1860 and under the auspices of the czar printed it in facsimile in 1862 twentyone lithographic plates made from photographs were included in this edition which was issued in four volumes the following year he published a critical edition of the new testament finally in 1867 he published additional fragments of genesis and numbers which had been used to bind other volumes at st catherines and had been discovered by the archimandrite porfirius on four different occasions then portions of the original manuscript have been discovered they have never been published together in a single edition the codex sinaiticus which originally must have contained the whole old testament has suffered severely from mutilation especially in the historical books from genesis to esdras inclusive the rest of the old testament fared much better the fragments and books extant are several verses from gen xxiii and xxiv and from num v vi vii i par ix 27xix 17 esdras ix9 to end nehemias esther tobias judith joel abdias jonas nahum habacuc sophonias aggeus zacharias malachias isaias jeremias lamentations i 1ii 20 i machabees iv machabees apocryphal while the canonical ii machabees and the apocryphal iii machabees were never contained in this codex a curious occurrence is that esdras ix 9 follows i par xix 17 without any break the note of a corrector shows that seven leaves of i par were copied into the book of esdras probably by a mistake in the binding of the manuscript from which codex sinaiticus was copied our esdras is called in this codex as in many others esdras b this may indicate that it followed esdras a as the book called by jerome iii esdras see esdras is named in ancient codices the proof is by no means sure however as iv machabees is here designated machabees d as was usual although the second and third books of machabees were absent from the manuscript the new testament is complete likewise the epistle of barnabas six leaves following barnabas are lost which probably also contained uncanonical literature the shepherd of hermas is incomplete and we cannot tell whether other works followed in all there are 346 12 leaves the order of the new testament is to be noted st pauls epistles preceding acts hebrews following ii thess the manuscript is on good parchment the pages measure about 15 inches by 13 12 inches there are four columns to a page except in the poetical books which are written stichometrically in two columns of greater width there are 48 lines to a column but 47 in the catholic epistles the four narrow columns give the page the appearance of an ancient roll it is not impossible as kenyon says that it was in fact copied from a papyrus roll it is written in uncial characters well formed without accents or breathings and with no punctuation except at times the apostrophe and the single point for a period tischendorf judged that there were four hands engaged in the writing of the manuscript in this he has been generally followed he has been less happy in obtaining acceptance of his conjecture that one of these scribes also wrote the new testament of the vatican codex he recognized seven correctors of the text one of them contemporaneous with the writing of the manuscript the ammonian sections and the eusebian canons are indicated in the margin probably by a contemporary hand they seem to have been unknown to the scribe however who followed another division the clerical errors are relatively not numerous in gregorys judgment in age this manuscript ranks alongside the codex vaticanus its antiquity is shown by the writing by the four columns to a page an indication probably of the transition from the roll to the codex form of manuscript by the absence of the large initial letters and of ornaments by the rarity of punctuation by the short titles of the books the presence of divisions of the text antedating eusebius the addition of barnabas and hermas etc such indications have induced experts to place it in the fourth century along with codex vaticanus and some time before codex alexandrinus and codex ephræmi rescriptus this conclusion is not seriously questioned though the possibility of an early fifthcentury date is conceded its origin has been assigned to rome southern italy egypt and caesarea but cannot be determined kenyon handbook to the textual criticism of the new testament london 1901 p 56 sqq it seems to have been at one time at caesarea one of the correctors probably of seventh century adds this note at the end of esdras this codex was compared with a very ancient exemplar which had been corrected by the hand of the holy martyr pamphilus  which exemplar contained at the end of the subscription in his own hand taken and corrected according to the hexapla of origen antonius compared it i pamphilus corrected it pamphilus was with eusebius the founder of the library at caesarea some are even inclined to regard codex sinaiticus as one of the fifty manuscripts which constantine bade eusebius of caesarea to have prepared in 331 for the churches of constantinople but there is no sign of its having been at constantinople nothing is known of its later history till its discovery by tischendorf the text of codex sinaiticus bears a very close resemblance to that of codex vaticanus though it cannot be descended from the same immediate ancestor in general codex vaticanus is placed first in point of purity by contemporary scholars and codex sinaiticus next this is especially true for the new testament of the gospels the differences are more frequent in the old testament where the codices sinaiticus and alexandrinus often agree john f fenlon retrieved from httpsenwikisourceorgwindexphptitlecatholic_encyclopedia_1913codex_sinaiticusoldid4652053 category
