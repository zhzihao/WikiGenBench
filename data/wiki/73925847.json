pick to fill a seat on the senate judiciary committee thats currently held by ailing california sen dianne feinstein d but cardins nomination to rejoin his former committee where he served from 2007 to 2011 failed to clear a procedural hurdle tuesday afternoon senate republicans have vowed to block any move to replace feinstein on the panel which has been paralyzed by an even partisan divide since early march when feinstein was hospitalized for shingles at least 10 republican votes would have been needed to replace feinstein on the panel in a statement cardin said he put himself up as the replacement with feinsteins blessing senator feinsteins work on the judiciary committee and her legacy in the senate are legendary i look forward to her full recovery and return to the senate in the meantime and with her blessing i am honored that majority leader schumer has recommended me as a temporary replacement on the judiciary committee cardin said i served on the judiciary committee when i first came to the senate and i am prepared to rejoin the committee in a temporary capacity for senator feinstein because of the stalemate on the judiciary panel the senates narrow democratic majority has been unable to advance president joe bidens judicial nominees  a status quo that many republicans are eager to maintain cardin is widely believed to be announcing a decision this week about

mccormack the former delegate was charged last summer with three counts of misconduct in office two counts of theft and two counts of fraudulent misappropriation all stemming from his misuse of state

bradley an attorney for householder expressed disappointment with the verdict we will take some time to discuss and evaluate our legal options moving forward and will most certainly pursue an appeal he said larry is looking forward to going home and spending time with his family after what has been an exhausting seven week trial cnn reached out to an attorney for borges for comment the release

occurring at the highest levels of chicago city government said acting us attorney morris pasqual in this case defendant burke had his hand out for money he tied the giving of official action by him to the giving of money to him related current former city council colleagues call burke conviction sad and a tragedy related a federal jury has convicted ed burke chicago is better for it burke squeezed the developers for business for his private tax appeals law firm klafter  burke he also threatened the field museum because it failed to respond when he recommended the daughter of former ald terry gabinski for an internshipthe jury in burkes trial also convicted one of burkes codefendants charles cui of bribery and lying to the fbi however they acquitted a second codefendant longtime burke aide peter andrewsin a statement from the lawyers who represented him signed team pete attorneys called andrews indictment an overreach and the verdict a welldeserved christmas blessingon behalf of our client we are grateful to the twelve jurors who understood what we have known for over four years pete andrews did not belong in this indictment the statement read andrews was seen leaving the courthouse wearing a santa hatthursdays verdict still brings to a dramatic end a year full of corruption trials in chicago nine people including burke were found guilty amid five trials in 2023 that resulted from federal public corruption investigationsbut burkes conviction is a landmark of its own and he now joins a long line of chicago officials convicted of a crime he is the 38th alderperson to be convicted since 1973 and the fourth in five years related ed burke figurehead of the old regime faces historic corruption trial the jury that convicted burke included two people who said they live in chicago one said she lives in ravenswood the other said he lives around fulton market the panel also included a graphic designer a dcfs child welfare specialist and a restaurant hostchicago mayor brandon johnson issued a short statement after the verdict was announced he said elected officials who dont abide by the law should be held accountable and that is what the jury decided todaya powerful and seemingly untouchable oldschool politician burke took office in 1969 when city hall was controlled by mayor richard j daley burke then spent 54 years representing chicagos 14th ward leaving office only last may meanwhile he amassed nearly unrivaled power through his decadeslong chairmanship of the finance committeehe famously clashed with the late mayor harold washington chicagos first black mayor burke and thenald edward vrdolyak led a group of mostly white alderpersons in opposing washington during what came to be known as council wars later he came to be known as the dean or parliamentarian of the city council a charismatic storyteller who would begin or end floor speeches with obscure historical anecdotesand outside city government burke propelled judges to the bench in his role as judicial slatemaker for the cook county democratic partythat all changed when the fbi famously raided burkes city hall and ward offices on nov 29 2018 covering windows with butcher paper and signaling the existence of what turned out to be a sprawling public corruption investigation now nearing its 10year anniversary related five years ago butcher paper signaled fbi raid on offices of untouchable ed burke  changing chicago history the fbi knocked on the backdoor entrance of burkes 14th ward office around 830 am jurors heard during burkes trial a cooperative ward worker gave agents the lay of the land before they began meticulously photographing and logging the contents of burkes office space over five hours the evidence gathered that day included a massive folder burke kept with records on executives of the burger king that burke was convicted of trying to extortfederal prosecutors initially charged burke with attempted extortion in january 2019 and a grand jury handed up its broader indictment of burke in may 2019 crucial to that indictment was the work of solis who represented chicagos 25th ward on the city council for 23 yearsthe fbi confronted solis with evidence of his own alleged wrongdoing on june 1 2016 he soon agreed to wear a wire against powerful chicago politicians including burke and madiganit wasnt until january 2019 that the chicago suntimes revealed that solis had been secretly recording burke solis then went underground leaving the city council in 2019 he only surfaced last week when burkes attorneys called him to the witness standsolis admitted during his testimony that hed been scared when the fbi confronted him in 2016 he agreed he wanted to save himself and at one point he conceded i was trying to help myself by recording ed burkethe news about the feds pursuit of burke and the cooperation of solis all broke in the midst of the 2019 race for chicago mayor lori lightfoot who won that election and served one term in office acknowledged this fall that the burke prosecution helped propel her to victory that yearin a statement after the verdict thursday lightfoot said the tyranny of ed burke is over she also tried to highlight the various enablers that helped burke amass his power including the practice of aldermanic prerogative lightfoot a former federal prosecutor tried to end that tradition of deference to city council members on matters in their wardsbut like many before who feasted on their gluttonous power burke was felled because this total lack of accountability made him foolishly think he was invincible lightfoot said so he grossly overplayed his hand he dug his own grave and jumped in only time will tell if the lessons of ed burkes ascent and spectacular fall will lead to desperately needed reforms begun but not nearly finished around transparency and accountability she also said i like to think somewhere harold has some need for you nowburke had his assistant reach out to thenbuildings commissioner judy frydland to ask her to look into cuis polesign issue the same day burkes firm began signing cui up as a clientbut the heart of the feds case against burke was really the alleged scheme involving the old post office solis who represented the area where the building stands made crucial recordings heard by the jury documenting that schemethe development firm that agreed to take on the complicated renovation of the depressionera building 601w companies llc of new york quickly became frustrated with amtrak as it embarked on its work amtrak owned the railroad tracks that run underneath the building but jurors heard that it dragged its feet and charged the post office developers exorbitant feesburke took advantage of their troubles he was repeatedly recorded telling people he helped make an amtrak board members daughter a judgehe mentioned that bit of leverage in one key meeting that solis secretly recorded during that meeting burke explained 601ws troubles with amtrak and told his colleague jews are jews and theyll deal with jews to the exclusion of everybody else  unless theres a reason for them to use a christianthe lead developer of the old post office was jewish burke is roman catholiclater the developers discovered that city hall planned to tear down the buildings brokendown western plaza leaving a gaping hole in

scandal that led to her resignation last may appearing in us district court in baltimore pugh 69 pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states and two counts of tax evasion she pleaded not guilty to seven counts of wire fraud the plea is a dramatic development in a monthslong scandal over pughs selfpublished healthy holly books which prosecutors allege she fraudulently sold to local nonprofit organizations in order to fund her campaign and enrich herself the scandal led to the former mayors resignation in may after the baltimore city council called on her to step down and it adds to a lengthy list of corruption scandals tied to the maryland city where wrongdoing by public officials has long been a part of the political landscape the plea comes one day after federal prosecutors unsealed the 11count indictment against pugh that detailed an elaborate scheme that prosecutors say she and her former aide gary brown steered in order to enrich themselves promote ms pughs political career and fund her campaign for mayor its expected that the government will drop the remaining charges at sentencing which is scheduled for february 27 the us attorneys office said wednesday that pugh faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for the wire fraud conspiracy and for each of the seven counts of wire fraud five years in federal prison for conspiracy to defraud the united states and five years in federal prison for each of the two counts of tax evasion the indictment alleges that pugh and her associate solicited nonprofit organizations and foundations  chief among them the university of maryland medical center  to buy her books which promote healthy living among children but prosecutors said that in some cases the books were never delivered while in others the pair delivered the books and then converted them to their own use without the buyers knowledge or doublesold books profiting from the purchases healthy holly the childrens book authored by former mayor catherine pugh ap images for example robert hur the us attorney for the district of maryland said at a press conference on wednesday that pugh arranged for books that were donated to baltimore city schools to be delivered to her own office and that way she was able to secure free inventory of books she and brown would use for their own purposes the proceeds of the books were used to fund straw donations to her mayoral election campaign and also to fund the purchase and renovation of a home in baltimore hur alleges in april federal authorities executed search warrants at several locations tied to pugh including her home as part of their investigation into whether she improperly profited from the deal while serving on the hospitals board last spring cnn reported that umms spent 500000 to fund the purchase of some 100000 books from pughs company healthy holly llc the former mayor also received about 114000 from health care provider kaiser permanente for some 20000 books from 2015 to 2018 and an additional 80000 from the public foundation associated black charities which said it bought some 10000 copies of pughs between 2011 and 2016 federal agents in april removing items from the home of thenbaltimore mayor catherine pugh john strohsackergetty images the prosecutor also said wednesday that pugh created a fake business relationship with brown so he could make invoices for services he didnt actually provide her the former aide has already pleaded guilty to wire fraud and tax charges related to his conduct with pugh hur said additionally pugh is accused of filing false income tax returns in 2015 and 2016 and underreporting her income hur said the indictment alleges that the former mayors taxable income was 10 times what she reported to the irs for that year and she owed over 20 times in taxes than she actually paid in 2016 pugh who apologized in march for doing something to upset the people was elected mayor of baltimore in 2016 her predecessor stephanie rawlingsblake first came into the role when the former mayor sheila dixon resigned in 2010 after being convicted of embezzlement in
