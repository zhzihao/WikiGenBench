published 16 mar 2023 attachments maputo 16 march 2023  the united nations is deeply concerned by the devastating humanitarian impact of tropical cyclone freddy which struck mozambique for a second time on 11 march i would like to express my condolences to those who have lost loved ones and reiterate the solidarity of the united nations with the government and people of mozambique at this difficult time affirmed myrta kaulard united nations humanitarian coordinator for mozambique the un and our partners are working in support of the governmentled response rapid assessments are underway in the hardesthit areas where agricultural land and critical health sanitation and education infrastructure has been damaged and humanitarian partners are mobilizing assistance however operations continue to be hindered by heavy rains and strong winds with several key roads cutoff and flooded i must stress that the response is compounded and complicated by a cholera outbreak which was already spreading at an alarming rate before freddy she said today in maputo nearly 9000 cases have been detected across 38 districts with 1114 cases reported in the last week alone cholera is also spreading geographically and it is feared that rising floodwaters will only make the situation worse the large loss of major crop it is very concerning for the negative toll that it is likely to take on the food security and livelihoods of the population in areas that were already food insecure prior to this latest disaster large swathes of zambezia province are under water there is a risk of worsening floods and landslides due to water discharges from river basins that are above emergency levels that may both affect more people and hamper relief operations i am grateful to the emergency relief coordinator martin griffiths for today releasing 10 million from the central emergency response fund cerf to kickstart the cyclone and cholera response and would encourage other donors to follow suit stressed the un humanitarian coordinator for mozambique separate from the climate induced crisis in the center and south of mozambique she reiterated the critical importance of timely and substantial support to the humanitarian response plan to the needs of 16 million people victim of violence in the north of the country 60 per cent of whom are children the humanitarian response is currently just 12 per cent funded today as mozambique grapples with a climate crisis not of its making it is worth recalling that just four years ago tropical cyclone idai devastated mozambique leaving nearly two million people in need of assistance while lessons were learnt and since applied the increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events means we must urgently double down on our efforts

improved solid waste management services with the support of a 145 million grant from the international development association ida that was approved today the project aims to improve water supply and sanitation services and enhance the operational and financial efficiency of the blantyre water boardblantyres water supply system is under severe strain that is expected to worsen with increasing climate change impacts such as the recent tropical cyclone freddy furthermore the blantyre water board faces major operational and financial challenges which impede the reliable supply of water to the city additionally poor sanitation is a major public health issue such that when the city experiences flooding uncollected solid waste ends up in sewers drainage systems and water bodies further exacerbating the floods and increasing the risk of waterborne diseasesthe project is therefore designed to address the immediate and mediumterm water security and sanitation needs and support a longterm solution through the construction of new water sources independent power sources for water supply infrastructure network upgrades and improvement in efficiency sewerage system upgrades and solid waste management improvementsas we see from the ongoing cholera outbreak and the impacts of tropical cyclone freddy very poor access to water and sanitation translates into immediate and major public health issues the new water and sanitation project aims to address the underlying structural issues to build resilience to external shocks including through the institutional strengthening of the blantyre water board itself says hugh riddell world bank country manager for malawithe sixyear project to be implemented by blantyre water board and blantyre city council will focus on investments in water production network stabilization leak reduction renewable energy sources and water network expansion to unserved areas it will also contribute to the rehabilitation and upgrading of sewer

project is part of the series of projects sops until 2032 proposed by the government of malawi to support the development of a national water program and to increase water supply and sanitation access

freddy swept through southern malawi on 12 march 2023 with strong winds and heavy rains leaving the affected districts in a state of disaster and affecting the power supply throughout most of the country tropical storm freddy is set to be the longest tropical system since 1994 having weakened and reintensified seven times over the last month the malawi government has declared a state of disaster in 10 southern districts that have been hardest hit by the storm a large number of people are reported to have been affected of which 101648 households approximately 508244 people have been displaced with 534 camps set to accommodate the displaced according to reports from dodma the death toll which is currently at 499 as of 20 march 2023 is expected to rise as 427 people are still unaccounted for since some areas remain cut off due to relentless rain and fierce wind mcbain kanongodza secretary general for the malawi red cross society said we are grateful to the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies for the support through this emergency appeal this support will go a long way to help the survivors recover from the shock of tropical cyclone freddy devastation malawi red cross society mrcs is on the ground with volunteers working in dangerous conditions primarily conducting search and rescue by land and in rescue boats volunteers are providing first aid and psychosocial support to those affected nonfood items are also being distributed by mrcs to evacuation centres and hospitals john roche head of ifrcs delegation for malawi zambia and zimbabwe said the destruction left behind by tropical storm freddy which has displaced large numbers is a major concern as we are also tackling a widespread cholera outbreak at the same time we need to respond fast and ensure people have access to clean and safe drinking water to ensure that cholera does not spread beyond control the lack of sanitation and clean water sources which increases the risk of contracting cholera will be amplified after many homes have been washed away leaving displaced communities to be housed in camps the number of people living in camps may cause them to become hotspots for cholera and waterborne diseases in addition to risks of cholera the floods have caused many communities to be cut off from food for many days as well as causing widespread damage to farms and death of livestock many of these areas were already suffering from significant food insecurity the ifrc and its membership has launched an emergency appeal seeking 60 million swiss francs which will help the mrcs to assist up to 160000 people over 5 districts who have been affected by the severe impacts of tropical storm freddy through the appeal mrcs and its partners with the ifrc will look to scale up their response to the impact of tropical storm freddy the response will focus on the immediate needs of families displaced and hosted in camps for more information or to
