Excess heat generated from solar radiation is damaging to plant cells and thermal injury occurs during drought or when there is rapid transpiration which produces wilting.  Green vegetation contributes to moderating climate by being cooler than adjacent bare earth or constructed areas. As plant leaves transpire they use energy to evaporate water aggregating up to a huge volume globally every day.\n\nAn individual tree transpiring 100 litres of water is equivalent to a cooling power of 70 kWh. Urban heat island effects can be attributed to the replacement of vegetation by constructed surfaces. Deforested areas reveal a higher temperature than adjacent intact forest. Forests and other natural ecosystems support climate stabilisation.\n\nThe Earth’s energy budget reveals pathways to mitigate climate change using our knowledge of the efficacy of how plants cool and moderating Western approaches with proven indigenous and traditional sources of knowledge.\n\nTranspiration and cooling \n\nEvapotranspiration is the combined processes moving water from the earth’s surface into the atmosphere. Transpiration is the movement of water through a plant and out of its leaves and other aerial parts into the atmosphere. This movement is driven by solar energy. In the tallest trees, such as Sequoia sempervirens, the water rises well over 100 metres from root-tip to canopy leaves. Such trees also exploit evaporation to keep the surface cool. Water vapour from evapotranspiration mixed with air moves upwards to the point of saturation and then, helped by the emissions of cloud condensation nuclei, forms clouds. Each gram molecule (mole) of condensing water will bring about a marked 1200-fold plus reduction in volume.The simultaneous release of latent heat will drive air from below to fill the partial vacuum. The energy required for the surrounding air to move in is readily calculated from the small (one-fifteenth of latent heat) reduction in temperature.\n\nA small amount of that water transpired is used for growth and metabolism. Photosynthesis takes place in the cells of plants and other organisms such as algae, that contain chlorophyll. This process uses the radiant energy from the sun to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen that when combined with the carbon sourced from carbon dioxide, produces sugars. Photosynthesis is therefore the basis of almost all food production and produces oxygen as a byproduct. \n\nLeaves have many functions. In addition to receiving water from the roots and creating the raw materials for photosynthesis, they also have a large internal surface area to enable the exchange of gases. Their stomata control the flow of water vapour out of the leaf and air into the leaf. In many plants, this is achieved in a structure thin enough to be semi-translucent, to enable some light to pass through to neighbouring leaves. The water that becomes raw material for sugar production, also cools the leaf and supports its structure through the pressure of turgidity.  In 2022, attempts to mass-produce artificial leaves to replicate this process and create hydrogen were still in the development stage. All organic matter, living and dead, originated as sugars. Part of the process of creating those sugars was splitting the water molecule into its component parts. Vegetation has a huge influence on climate, enacted through photosynthesis and transpiration.Botanists have calculated that there are about 600 square inches [3,871 cm2] of surface inside a leaf for every cubic inch [16.38 cm3]  of its bulk and that a large elm tree has in all some 15 million leaves within an area, if spread out whole, of nearly 10 acres [4.05 ha] or, if unfolded into the sum total of air-breathing light-absorbing surfaces of all the internal chloroplasts something like 25 square miles [64.75 square kilometres].Plants cool when they transpire. Evaporating water and transmitting it through leaf stomata requires a lot of energy. Fred Pearce states that “a single tree transpiring a hundred litres of water a day has a cooling power equivalent to two household air-conditioning units” (p. 29). An individual tree can transpire hundreds of litres of water per day. Transpiring 100 litres is equivalent to a cooling power of 70 kWh. Jan Pokorny posits that a tree with a crown of 5 metres diameter covers an area of about 20m2. Of the 150 kWh falling on the crown, 1% is used for photosynthesis, 10% reflected as light energy, 5 to 10% as sensible heat with the remaining 79 to 84% entering the process of transpiration. If a larger tree has a sufficient water supply, it can evaporate more than 100 L of water a day. In order to evaporate 100 L of water, approximately 70 kWh (250 MJ) of solar energy is needed. This energy is hidden in water vapor as latent heat and is released again during the process of condensation to liquid water.Extrapolated to a hectare, the cooling power of a closed canopy is 35,000 kWh a day.\nCities with constructed surfaces and devegetation are typically warmer than adjacent countryside. This phenomena is known as urban heat islands. For example Tokyo’s average September temperature has increased by almost 2 °C. over 100 years. This differential would increase in the summer months. Significant increases for cities in the tropics such as Dhaka are projected, accelerated by urban growth and intensification. The city of Melbourne “plans to plant 3000 trees in Melbourne every year to increase the resilience of the urban forest and to cool our city by 4°C.”  Increasing tree cover and evapotranspiration provides a localised mitigation solution.\n\nOn a larger scale, The Mau Forest complex in Western Kenya was deforested from 5,200 km2 in 1986 to 3,400 km2 in 2009. Satellite images revealed temperature increases with deforested areas being 20 °C hotter or more.\n\nThere were about six trillion trees on the planet, but human activity has destroyed roughly half.  Increasing terrestrial biomass will cool the planet. Of the latent heat that escapes at recondensation at cloud level half departs the atmosphere into space, as the photons escape in a part of the spectrum that does not get reabsorbed by greenhouse gases.\n\nUsing satellite imagery, the impact of regeneration processes restoring vegetation in arid areas is visible from space and can tracked over time. Vegetation restoration is clearly visible in images of the Penbamoto project in Tanzania.Seeing African Restoration from Space: Planet and Justdiggit... The data associated with these images reveal a temperature reduction in the topsoil up to 0.75 °C. This temperature reduction was achieved in four years. We can anticipate a larger reduction as the vegetation cover increases.\n\nThe movement of water vapour and thermal energy in the atmosphere \nThe movement of heat embodied in water vapour as it leaves vegetation is not well understood given the complexity of the dynamics. While the movement of water into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and consequent cooling is broadly accepted, the movement of water further into the atmosphere is more contentious. There are observable phenomena that provide some clues; mornings following cloudless skies will be cooler than cloudy nights, and deserts get very hot during the day and cool rapidly at night. Heat transfer physics are complex, and involve energy carriers including photons. When energy is freed upon condensation, photons are emitted, transferring energy both upward and downward in the atmosphere. Oceans add further complexity of atmospheric dynamics.\n\nA 2022 World Resources Institute report says that albedo, surface roughness, and aerosols, along with evapotranspiration, generate clouds that increase the albedo cooling effect. They calculate that reduced emissions from tropical forest loss could achieve 2.8 gigatonnes of CO2 per year, and an additional 1.4 gigatonnes of CO2 per year of additional cooling through these albedo effects.\n\nUsing thermal imaging to illustrate transpirational cooling \n\nThermal imaging captures the infrared radiation emitted from an object. Michal Kravčík, Jan Pokorný and co-authors used thermographs to demonstrate the temperature differential between vegetation and constructed surfaces in their 2007 Water for the recovery of the climate - a new water paradigm.\n\nThe images to the right were taken with a thermal lens mounted on a mobile phone alongside visual images for reference points. A 20 °C. plus temperature differential between vegetation and was often recorded. The three images here pair thermal images and visual images. They reveal significant temperature differences between vegetated and bare surfaces. The image of the Coronation Reserve shows an areas of turf and the margin of native forest separated by a herbicide strip. The bottom image is a thermal image with a slightly different perspective, mainly caused by different camera lenses. The key information distilled from these images is the temperature differences. The grass and the forest margin have similar heat signatures. Temperatures range from 29 to 37 °C. while the dividing herbicide strip reaches 53 °C. Note also the vehicle tracks in the top image with roughly proximate higher temperature readings in the bottom image with an 8 °C. differential. Over time vehicles compact soil structure leading to reduced plant growth, especially when vehicles drive on wet soils. This image reveals that turf can be as cooling as forest. \n\nA second side-by-side comparison of thermal and visual images are of a traffic meridian. The ground cover plants are Coprosma repens 'Poor Knights'. The mulch, at its hottest, is 61 °C. The coprosma are as cool as 32 °C. - a 29 °C temperature difference.\n\nSignificance for climate mitigation \nNon-vegetated or constructed surfaces absorb incoming solar radiation striking that energy and re-radiating it as infrared heat with long waveforms. This is sensible heat in that it can be sensed. Temperature is changed without a change of state. By contrast latent heat (hidden heat) results from a change of state without a change of temperature. For example as radiant energy warms a body of water it raises the temperature generating sensible heat. Water evaporated from the body of water changes state as latent heat. To change one gram of liquid water to vapour requires 540 calories of heat, and if that water vapour condenses back to liquid water 540 calories are released. One climate mitigation pathway is for water vapour to carry energy back into the atmosphere where some of that energy will dissipate into space.\n\nEarth’s energy budget reveals the pathways of solar energy to earth, its cycling in earth systems and atmosphere, and release back into space. There is an average of 340.4 watts/m2 of incoming energy. To maintain a stable climate the same amount of energy must return to space. While increased levels of greenhouse gasses retain more heat, there are other pathways that can influence this energy balance. Understanding these dynamics provides more pathways to moderate the climate than simply relying on emissions reductions and sequestration alone. Referencing the NASA earth’s energy budget, an example is reducing the 398.2 watts/m2 emitted by the surface, by extending terrestrial and marine vegetative cover as a percentage of land cover and by extending the length of seasonal growth. This is achieved through a whole system approach including regenerating the soil carbon sponge, protection of existing forests, reafforestation, and restoring the biotic pump. The heat emitted from the planet (398.2 watts/m2) is greater than incoming solar energy (340.4 watts/m2).\n\nIndigenous stewardship for climate moderation \nIncreasing vegetative cover will be enhanced by protecting indigenous rights. Deforestation is an expression of the extractive industries of colonisation. Recent scholarship has identified that indigenous communities in Australia  and North America maintained landscapes to reduce the incidence of uncontrolled forest fire and maintain biodiversity. A study of 12,000 years of population data found that “three quarters of terrestrial nature has long been shaped by diverse histories of human habitation and use by Indigenous and traditional peoples”.  With rare exceptions, current biodiversity losses are caused not by human conversion or degradation of untouched ecosystems, but rather by the appropriation, colonization, and intensification of use in lands inhabited and used by prior societies.This calls on us to unlearn some of the assumptions embedded in Western epistemologies and the decolonisation of knowledge as a foundation for more effective climate action.\n\nSee also \n Effects of climate change on the water cycle\n Water cycle\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Working with plants, soils and water to cool the climate and rehydrate Earth’s landscapes.

irreversible thermodynamics a molecular kinetic model for tensile water formation and turnover is presented which is found to be mathematically equivalent with an autocatalytic reaction brusselator it is also shown to be consistent with the van der waals equation for real liquidgas systems which empirically considers intermolecular forces it can therefore be used to explain both the irreversible thermodynamics and the kinetics of the tensile liquid state of water a nonlinear bistable evaporation behavior of tensile water is predicted which has not yet been experimentally characterized in trees conventional sap flow techniques in combination with infrared imaging of heat flow around a local heat source were used to study the dynamics and energetics of water transport of trees during the eclipse of august 11 1999 the evaporative pulling force in a tree was demonstrated with infrared techniques and shown to respond within seconds while the ambient temperature during the eclipse did not drop by more than 2 degrees c evaporative water transport was reduced by a factor of up to 23 the expected hysteresis with an up to 50 decrease in energyconversionrelated entropy production was measured reflecting a bistable mode of conversion of solar energy into tensile water flow this nonlinear autocatalytic phenomenon together with tensile molecular order damped the oscillating behavior of xylem tensile water and its occasional allornone rupture cavitation can thus be explained by the nonlinear nature of intermolecular forces active in the water conduitparenchyma environment this

significancethe current biodiversity crisis is often depicted as a struggle to preserve untouched habitats here we combine global maps of human populations and land use over the past 12000 y with current biodiversity data to show that nearly three quarters of terrestrial nature has long been shaped by diverse histories of human habitation and use by indigenous and traditional peoples with rare exceptions current biodiversity losses are caused not by human conversion or degradation of untouched ecosystems but rather by the appropriation colonization and intensification of use in lands inhabited and used by prior societies global land use history confirms that empowering the environmental stewardship of indigenous peoples and local communities will be critical to conserving biodiversity across the planetkeywords agriculture huntergatherer extinction conservation anthropoceneabstractarchaeological and paleoecological evidence shows that by 10000 bce all human societies employed varying degrees of ecologically transformative land use practices including burning hunting species propagation domestication cultivation and others that have left longterm legacies across the terrestrial biosphere yet a lingering paradigm among natural scientists conservationists and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive here we use the most uptodate spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong even 12000 y ago nearly three quarters of earths land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies including more than 95 of temperate and 90 of tropical woodlands lands now characterized as natural intact and wild generally exhibit long histories of use as do protected areas and indigenous lands and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural the current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands resulting instead from the appropriation colonization and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisismultiple studies confirm that ecosystems across most of the terrestrial biosphere from 75 to 95 of its area have now been reshaped to some degree by human societies 1 3 with a few exceptions eg refs 4 8 this global anthropogenic transformation of terrestrial nature has been described by natural scientists as mostly recent the product of the industrial era 9 13 this is partly because previous global reconstructions of early populations and land use systematically ignored these earlier transformations 1 5 14 and partly due to the conservation communitys focus on recent industrial changes 2 3 9 15 there has also been a history of natural scientists and conservation practitioners interpreting terrestrial ecosystems as uninfluenced by longsustained interactions with human societies ignoring prior histories of land use especially by indigenous societies 16 18 while this paradigm has increasingly been questioned with respect to longterm global changes in climate 19 fire regimes 20 and biodiversity 7 8 21 it continues to have realworld consequences including failed policies of fire suppression wildlife management and ecological restoration as well as the repression and removal of indigenous peoples from traditional lands and waters and the erasure of their extensive knowledge of effective ecosystem management practices thereby undermining their sovereignty over these ecosystems 17 22 24here we examine contemporary global patterns of biodiversity and conservation in relation to the spatial history of human populations and land use over the past 12000 y specifically we use spatially explicit global datasets to visualize histories of human use in areas identified as biodiversityrich and highpriority for conservation including those specifically labeled as more natural or wild and test the degree to which global patterns of land use and population at different times are associated statistically with contemporary global patterns of high biodiversity value and vertebrate species richness and threat within areas prioritized for conservation through this examination we assess the early and sustained global significance of cultural landscapes as a basis for better understanding and conserving terrestrial natureanthropological archaeological and paleoecological evidence indicate that at least since the start of the current interglacial interval 11600 y ago all human societies were interacting with biota and environments in ways that shaped evolutionary dynamics ecosystems and landscapes 25 28 we use the term transformations to describe systemlevel changes in the socialecological systems shaped by these interactions including their initial formation by human inhabitation and the adoption of cultural practices leading to changes in ecosystem state sensu 5 27 while the focus is often on negative outcomes relating to these interactions including extinctions of island endemics 29 and megafauna 21 30 31 with cascading ecological consequences 32 there is increasing evidence that human cultural practices can also produce sustained ecological benefits through practices that expand habitat for other species 33 34 enhance plant diversity 17 34 37 increase hunting sustainability 38 provide important ecological functions like seed dispersal 39 and improve soil nutrient availability 40 41huntergatherers early farmers and pastoralists often shared regional landscapes which they shaped through a wide array of lowintensity subsistence practices including hunting transhumance residential mobility long and shortfallow cultivation polycropping and treefallowing that created diverse dynamic and productive mosaics of lands and novel ecological communities in varying states of ecological succession and cultural modification 34 37 42 in many regions these diverse cultural landscape mosaics were sustained for millennia 17 24 25 27 33 34 37 43 45 contrasting sharply with the more homogenous and continuously used landscapes of largerscale agricultural societies employing annual tillage irrigation continuous grazing and the extractive and colonial use of land labor and other resources to support elites 1 5 44 the emergence and spread of increasingly globalized and industrial societies only accelerated this trend toward todays ever more intensively used and homogeneous cultural landscapes shaped by global supply chains mechanization chemical nutrients and pest control leading to ecologically simplified habitats and biotic homogenization through species transported around the world intentionally and unintentionally 1 44 46assessing cultural natures globallywe use anthrome classification 1 to characterize the global spatial dynamics of cultural landscapes over the past 12000 y rather than reduce the rich global diversity of cultural landscapes to a single scale of human impact from low to high 2 3 anthromes characterize cultural landscapes by stratifying them into a spectrum of discrete categories analogous to biomes 1 based on their population densities and cover by intensive land uses crops pastures and cities at a regional landscape scale 100 km2 fig 1 three basic types of anthromes recognize major differences in land use intensity wildlands are characterized by the complete absence of human populations and intensive land uses cultured anthromes are less than 20 covered by intensive land uses and intensive anthromes are more than 20 covered by intensive land uses different anthrome classes are then identified within anthrome types in terms of relative population densities and different forms of intensive land uses areas of nonintensive land uses including foraging hunting forestry conservation fallow and remnant habitats are generally also embedded within cultured and intensive anthrome landscapes in varying amounts 1 47open in a separate windowfig 1global changes in anthromes and populations 10000 bce to

incorporate climateinduced vegetation dynamics or preagricultural forms of land use and is known to underestimate early agricultural land use 5 26 it nevertheless includes major improvements over prior model generations in representing early populations and land use especially hyde 31 48 to avoid statistical biases and to align with contemporary global assessments of biodiversity and

anthromes fig 1 30 cultured and just 19 in wildlands agreeing well with contemporary global assessments 1 3 56 in striking contrast to prior historical global reconstructions in which wildlands covered 82 of earths land in 6000 bce  the current reconstruction shows wildlands covering just 275 of earths land in 10000 bce 4000 y earlier fig 1b  uncertainties in si appendix fig s1 although there are substantial uncertainties in this estimate related to model assumptions this is the result of a far more widespread distribution of lowdensity populations in hyde 32 indicating that most of terrestrial nature 725 was already inhabited by huntergatherer andor early agricultural societies at the beginning of the current interglacial interval transforming wildlands into cultured anthromes since that time anthrome change trajectories fig 1b and si appendix fig s2 confirm that with some possible exceptions the majority of human transformation of terrestrial nature in terms of land area did not result from recent conversions of uninhabited wildlands to intensive anthromes but rather reflects longterm processes of land use intensification linked with population growth in landscapes already inhabited and used and the increasingly intensive use of landscapes around the world through colonization displacement and extraction from local peoples by largerscale agricultural and industrial economies 26the global spread of populations and increasingly intensive land use appears largely gradual over the past 12000 y although a global acceleration is evident in the late 19th century this acceleration which levels off by the middle of the 20th century fig 1b  contrasts sharply with changes in population and other global changes portrayed as the great acceleration of the mid20th century 13 this leveling off is best explained by the use of green revolution technologies to increase agricultural production on lands already in use a trend that continues today 57regional patterns of land use change diverge widely from global trends fig 2 uncertainties in si appendix fig s3 even in 10000 bce wildlands covered very small extents of europe asia africa and latin america and the caribbean fig 2 and already by 1 ce intensive agricultural andor pastoral transformations were underway in parts of every region following distinct trajectories these transformation pathways track historical trends in human societies in some regions including the rise and decline of the roman empire in europe the han empire in china the expansion of tropical city states circa 1000 ce  and the dramatic population declines and social and political devastation caused by colonialism and disease during the columbian exchange circa 1500 ce across latin america and the caribbean 18 yet uninhabited wildlands are depicted as covering nearly half of north america the near east eurasia and oceania in 10000 bce fig 2 and change little over time this is a result that disagrees with much existing evidence of extensive early populations and land use across these regions 16 18 26 33 revealing likely biases against early human habitation and use in this reconstructionopen in a separate

but only tundra was mostly wildlands 67 and remained as such in 2017 ce 565 gradual conversion of wildlands and cultured anthromes to intensive anthromes was apparent across every biome by 2017 ce the majority of grasslands and savannas 842 shrublands 727 and temperate woodlands 653 were all transformed into intensive anthromes by 2017 ce in these biomes most transformation to intensive occurred in

marks transition from 1000 y to 100 y time stepsat the global scale contemporary global patterns of vertebrate species richness and kbas are significantly associated with current anthrome maps fig 4b  though prior work has found a positive association between lowintensity land use and biodiversity especially in indigenous peoples lands 51 our data extend this relation to the land use of the past fig 4b  although historical anthrome patterns were only slightly associated with vertebrate species richness and kbas at a global scale their association with threatened vertebrate species richness was greater than with current anthrome patterns fig 4b  associations between anthrome history and current biodiversity were strongest when viewed within the subset of earths land characterized as likely or potentially natural 53 fig 4b  but this was also true to some extent for indigenous lands and protected areas these patterns and associations differed among regions  si appendix fig s6 indicating that distinct regional legacies of past land use are associated with distinct patterns of biodiversity and global conservation priorities in many cases this may represent the novel biodiversity patterns of cultural landscapes sustained for millennia and later depopulated or abandoned 60 61taken together our evidence indicates that the cultural natures of millennia and centuries ago are highly associated with and may have shaped current global patterns of kbas vertebrate species richness and threatened species fig 4b  there is also some indication that after 1500 ce the strength of this association declines in multiple regions indicating a potential shift in relations between anthromes and biodiversity following the columbian exchange and european colonial expansion either way the current extinction crisis is better explained by the displacement of speciesrich cultural natures sustained by past societies than the recent conversion and use of uninhabited wildlands 17 22decolonizing natures past and presentin this study based on historical global reconstructions of land use and populations only about 17 of earths land was without evidence of prior human habitation or use over the past 12000 y yet even this low percentage is certainly an overestimate based on growing evidence that the most uptodate global change models remain biased toward underestimating the importance of early human habitation and land use especially in areas where seasonal and temporary habitation and use of land predominates 5 26human societies have been shaping and sustaining diverse cultural natures across most of the terrestrial biosphere for more than 12000 y areas under indigenous management today are recognized as some of the most biodiverse areas remaining on the planet 51 61 and landscapes under traditional lowintensity use are generally much more biodiverse than those governed by highintensity agricultural and industrial economies 62 63 although some societies practicing lowintensity land use contributed to extinctions in the past the cultural shaping and use of ecosystems and landscapes is not in itself the primary cause of the current extinction crisis and neither is the conversion of untouched wildlands which were nearly as rare 10000 y ago as they are today the primary cause of declining biodiversity at least in recent times is the appropriation colonization and intensifying use of lands already inhabited used and reshaped by current and prior societiesdepicting human use of nature largely as a recent and negative disturbance of an otherwise humanfree natural world is not only incorrect but has profound implications for both science and policy across the vast majority of this planet traditional indigenous and contemporary cultural natures together with their interwoven peoples and histories and not areas free from human influence are essential for understanding and sustaining terrestrial nature including its biodiversity and contributions to people 2 24 47 49 51 64 effective sustainable and equitable conservation of biodiversity and natures contributions to people recognizes and empowers indigenous traditional and local peoples and their cultural heritage of sustainable ecosystem management through rights and responsibilities as an essential basis for conservation strategies and priorities around the world 17 23 51 65 66 efforts to achieve ambitious global conservation and restoration agendas 11 15 will not succeed without more explicitly recognizing embracing and restoring these deep cultural and societal connections with the biodiversity they aim to sustainmethodsdgg system all previous global historical population and land use reconstructions have used 5 arc minute geographic units designed for compatibility with climate models this use of nonequal area units which vary from 85 km2 at the equator to 10 km2 at the poles causes biases in global statistical analyses toward northern latitudes where grid cells are smaller and therefore more numerous per unit land area while also distorting proportional area measures like those used in anthrome classification and scaledependent variables like species richness in this study all data were assessed in an equal area dgg system recently used in policyrelevant global biodiversity assessments to represent regional
