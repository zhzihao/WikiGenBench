hotel and are you the one the resurgence of dumb horny dating shows couldnt come at a better timepilot viruetupdatedjul 22 2019947am edtpublishedjul 22 2019445am edtphoto illustration by the daily beastin last weeks premiere episode of love island the contestants are introduced to us in prerecorded interviews where they discuss past bad relationships ideal partners and their hopes for finding true love these interviews are interspersed with footage of each one inexplicably attempting to look sexy while laying in a ball pit that also happens to include rubber ducks there is no discernible reason why the ball pit is necessary nor is there a way to look sultry while flailing around in one its totally ridiculous and its perfectlove island a compulsively watchable reality dating series originated in the uk and thanks to hulu has found a legion of dedicated american fans it was only a matter of time before the series crossed the pond last tuesday cbs premiered the us adaptation set to air four  nights a week cbs other summer reality staple big brother airs only three it isnt what you call good television but its far more purely enjoyable than much scripted fare especially because its selfaware enough to never aim much higher than attractive people hooking up arguing and working out it doesnt want to be the bachelor and it knows theres more fun and drama to be had when all the contestants want to fuck each other rather than competing for one person based on the first week cbs love island doesnt live up to the charm and smarm of its uk counterpart especially missing are the accents the jargon and the gleefully groanworthy narration from iain stirling but its still hard to look away the actual conceit of the show is this a group of sexy singles temporarily live in a beautiful villa and pair off into couples while attempting to find true love andor a cash reward by the end frequently new islanders are brought in couples break up new ones form people are voted out every once in a while there is a recoupling ceremony to shake things up these ceremonies by the way are just about the only time everyone isnt wearing a swimsuit in between they participate in challenges that are mostly excuses for the producers to get everyone in even less clothing than usual and to blatantly introduce drama by revealing secrets or encouraging spontaneous makeout sessions truth or dare is a popular game and the producers are also fond of introducing lie detector exams its all decidedly unsubtleand slightly sociopathicbut it wouldnt work if it wasnt even this simplistic description is too complex for love island the highlight is watching them all interact with each other via painfully awkward flirting immediate possessiveness and jealousy and fumbling sex while sharing a room with about eight other people it can be gleefully cruel but its so much fun to watch because you dont have to think about anything except for the stupidity of the contestantsthe reason i keep going back to og love island in between watching other showsteen nihilist drama euphoria the exhausting twilight zone reboot that hits you over the head with political allegory the harrowing chernobyl that cant be watched while eatingis because i needed something that felt decidedly less cerebral something i could only half pay attention to anything that would make me temporarily more invested in horrible couples ill never meet than in our daily realities love island is only one of the many trashy and infectious dating reality shows this year that ive become temporarily obsessed with shows that are ideal for lazy summer afternoon viewings and that provide a nice antidote to heavier scripted dramas back in january the usa network debuted a reboot of foxs temptation island which originally ran from 2001 to 2003 the series originally a source of controversy doesnt go much deeper than its name four couples who are trying to decide if they should stay together or call it quits are separated so they can temporarily live with attractive and ahem tempting members of the opposite gender they can choose to be faithful or they can cheat its an awful borderlinecruel premise akin to rubbernecking a car accident but its easy to keep in mind that if this is your lastditch effort to save your relationship its probably not worth saving usas reboot didnt feel as fresh as the original series but its still a lowstakes way to kill a few hoursits strange how less stressful these real couples feel than the fictional ones on hbo it can be gleefully cruel but its so much fun to watch because you dont have to think about anything except for the stupidity of the contestants in may fox rebooted paradise hotel which aired two seasons in 2003 and 2008 now hosted by kristin cavallari the hills paradise hotel shares a similar format to love island people are paired into couples and share a room there is one person left over who has to pair up by the end of the week or be evicted from the hotel the winning couple has to individually decide if they want to split the 250000 prize with each other or keep it with only seven episodes the 2019 season was breezy and full of laughable engaging drama between couples you will never see againbut the best of these is are you the one mtvs needlessly complicated dating show the producers use a matchmaking algorithm to secretly pair up couples and throughout the season the contestants live together while trying to figure out who everyones perfect match is if they identify all of them correctly they win a shared 1 million prize there are other silly things thrown inridiculous dates challenges a relationship expert a truth booththat arent really worth explaining but what works so well about this currently airing season is that all of the contestants are sexually fluid and allowed to hook up with anyone instead of relying on the boring hetero couple formula that every other show employsthe result is both scintillatingly slutty and dramaticin the twopart premiere kai a trans man has sex with both a cis woman and a cis man in the same nightand legitimately groundbreaking this is the first dating show ive seen with a trans contestant a nonbinary contestant and serious conversations about gender identity and sexuality but it also doesnt betray its lowbrow roots everyone kisses everyone and there is nonstop jealousy and arguing kai and jenna the most explosive couple literally alternate between screaming at each other and furiously making out at one point while basically dryhumping in the middle of the floor they yell youre toxic and youre more toxic than i am at each other yet the strangest thing about are you the one which im sure is mostly due to its queerness is that its also the first dating show where i find myself actively rooting for couples to work you know young love plus not to be outdone by love islands emphasis on sex last weeks episode featured a fivesome at one point while basically dryhumping in the middle of the floor they yell youre toxic and youre more toxic than i am at each other the draw of these series is this inherent ridiculousness the idiocy of the basic premises the enduring garbage antics the appeal is that they are impossible to take seriously even when the contestants themselves are grave take love islands premiere where a man unironically explains that he came on the show because hes trying to find someone in an organic way there is nothing surprising about any of this you can barely make it through an episode without someone talking about how they have trust issues because they were cheated on so they built up walls and it takes a long time for them to let someone in the long time is usually one to two weeks if you want to get wasted take a drink whenever someone talks about putting their eggs all in one basketthese series provide a great welcoming break from how heavy everything else feels both in the real world and on screen of course the grimness of a show like the handmaids tale or the political world of orange is the new black is important and necessary but sometimes its too much especially all at once television tends to respond to politics so it makes sense why so many series lately feel both dour and direwhich isnt a bad thing but it does sometimes feel overwhelming even facebooks reboot of the real world has been occasionally tough to watch as the roommates discuss racism homophobia and immigration there are times when you need to shut off that part of your brain in order to preserve your energy and your sense of self reality television and particularly this subgenre of it can feel similar to unplugging or engaging in selfcare sometimes the best ways to recharge is to tune into the dumbest thing you can find pilot viruetgot a tip send it to the daily beasthereread this listcheat sheetpoliticsentertainmentmediaworldinnovationus
