The wedding was the culmination of a nine-year courtship as King Olav V, Harald's father, was reluctant to permit his son and heir to marry a commoner.\n\nSince 1991, Harald and Sonja have been king and queen of Norway.\n\nEngagement\n\nCrown Prince Harald, the only son and heir of King Olav V of Norway, first met Sonja Haraldsen, the youngest child of Norwegian manufacturer Karl August Haraldsen (1889–1959) and Dagny Ulrichsen (1898–1994), in June 1959 at a party hosted by their mutual friend Johan Stenersen. In August 1959, Harald invited Sonja to a ball to celebrate his graduation from the Norwegian Military Academy.\n\nTheir courtship proved controversial as many felt the Crown Prince should marry a bride of royal descent. King Olav V refused to grant his consent to a non-royal match. The press linked Harald to Princess Alexandra of Kent, Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark. Following his 30th birthday in 1967, Harald told his father that if he could not marry Sonja, he would not marry at all. At the time, Harald was the only person in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne, and his not marrying would have ended the reign of his family, and possibly the monarchy, in Norway.\n\nFollowing consultations with the Norwegian government, who stated that while they could not give their formal approval to the marriage they would not publicly oppose it should the king give his consent, King Olav V eventually relented and on 18 March 1968, he announced the couple's engagement in a statement to the president of the Storting. Flags were flown from public buildings in celebration of the news. Harald presented Sonja with a diamond and ruby ring which had belonged to his late mother, Crown Princess Märtha. Their son, Crown Prince Haakon, eventually presented the same ring to Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby.\n\nPre-wedding celebrations\n\nMany of the foreign guests arrived in Oslo on 27 August. A grand ball at the Royal Palace had been planned but was canceled due to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the recent sudden death of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. Princess Marina was a close friend of King Olav V and the widow of his first cousin. Instead, the King gave a dinner for the royal guests who had arrived that day.\n\nOn 28 August, the couple and royal guests attended a modern art exhibition at the Henie Onstad Kunstsenter. Afterward, Else Werring, overhoffmesterinne of the royal court, and her husband Niels Werring gave a luncheon for the royal guests. That evening, the Norwegian government gave a state dinner at Akershus Fortress.\n\nWedding\n\nThe ceremony began at 17:00 local time. Dr Fridtjov Søiland Birkeli, Bishop of Oslo, presided over the Church of Norway ceremony at Oslo Cathedral. The cathedral was decorated with more than 2500 roses, marguerites, freesias, sweet peas and gladioli.\n\n3000 soldiers lined the processional route from the Royal Palace to the cathedral. The bells of Oslo City Hall rang from 16:30 local time on. Crown Prince Harald and his best man led the procession.\n\nMusic\nThe bride was escorted into the church by King Olav V to Trumpet Tune and Airs by Henry Purcell. The Norwegian Student Choral Society sang Herre Gud! Dit dyre navn og ære (Lord God, your precious name and glory) by Petter Dass, the congregation sang the hymn Til kjærleik Gud oss skapte (In love God created us) by Bernt Støylen. Norwegian soprano Aase Nordmo Løvberg sang Alt står i Guds faderhånd (Everything rests in God the Father's hand) by N. F. S. Grundtvig. The bride and groom left the church to Johann Sebastian Bach's Prelude in E♭ major, BWV 552/1.\n\nAttire\nSonja wore a silk wedding gown by Molstad, a Norwegian department store. Like her sisters-in-law before her, she did not wear a tiara, instead using flowers in her hair to secure her long tulle veil. She carried a bouquet of white roses, freesias, lilies of the valley and orchids.\n\nCrown Prince Harald wore the Norwegian Army's black gala uniform with the riband and star of the Order of St. Olav and the stars of the Order of the Elephant and the Order of the Seraphim. His best man, Count Flemming of Rosenborg, wore the Royal Danish Navy's uniform with the riband and star of the Order of St. Olav and the star of the Order of the Elephant.\n\nAttendants\nCrown Prince Harald's best man was his cousin Count Flemming of Rosenborg. Sonja's maid of honour was her friend Ilmi Riddervold, her bridesmaids were Ingeborg Lorentzen (daughter of Princess Ragnhild), Lis Haraldsen (daughter of her brother Haakon), Ian Henriksen and Anita Henriksen (daughters of her sister Gry).\n\nGuests\n850 guests attended the wedding.

graduation ball in august of 1959 photo source atf the relationship between the crown prince and sonja was controversial as many people including politicians and journalists felt the crown prince should marry a princess and not a norwegian commoner the controversy continued for years as did the relationship despite the medias attempts to promote a royal marriage with either of the greek princesses sophia and irene apparently crown prince harald made it clear to his father king olav v that he would remain unmarried if he could not marry sonja this would have resulted in a succession crisis as harald was the sole heir to the throne at that time norway did not allow female succession so his two sisters ragnhild and astrid were not in the line of succession finally in 1968 when king olav felt the position of the norwegian people had changed to favor sonja he consulted with parliamentary leaders and other government leaders and gave his consent for the crown prince to marry a commoner the engagement of the couple was announced on march 19 1968 with this announcement from king olav v it is with pleasure that i inform you mr president and members of the storting that i after
