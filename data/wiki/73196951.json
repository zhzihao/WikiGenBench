{"id": 73196951, "key": "The Aosawa Murders", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Aosawa%20Murders", "text": "The Aosawa Murders is the first crime novel written by Riku Onda and was published in Japan in 2005. Bitter Lemon Press later published an English translation in 2020.\n\nThe novel focuses on a 1973 mass poisoning case set in seaside city K—. At a birthday celebration for the influential Aosawa family, seventeen people died from poisoning after drinking sake and soft drinks.\n\nOnda's writing style is classified as shin honkaku, a \"new orthodox\" form of Japanese detective fiction, and is structured to focus on three converging timelines.\n\nOnda drew inspiration for the novel after listening to Michel Petrucciani's song Eugenia. It also references the Teigin Incident, a real case of mass cyanide poisoning in Japan that occurred in 1948.\n\nThe reception of the novel was well received, landing on top 100 notable books of 2020 by The New York Times. She won the Best Novel for Mystery Writers of Japan Award in 2006.\n\nSummary \n\nThe Aosawa family is a prominent family within the city of K–.  As they celebrate a multi-generational birthday party, that admiration is sullied when an unnamed man presents the attendants with sake and soft drinks as a gift. This resulted in the death of 17 people: family and friends who had gathered for the party. The Aosawa housekeeper miraculously survives, but the survivor that everyone focuses on is Hisako Aosawa, the beautiful, blind daughter and only survivor from the Aosawa family. Makiko Saiga, one of her admirers, discovers the crime along with her older brothers. Makiko, being so affected by the mass poisoning, wrote the novel The Forgotten Festival which was inspired by the event.\n\nAn unnamed narrator interviews Makiko about her thoughts on the murders. Makiko reveals that her novel started off as a university thesis but then got picked up by a publisher. She explains that she wanted to figure out something by publishing the book, but after its release, she lost interest in it. At the end of the interview, the narrator asks her about the real culprit. Makiko comments that the answer is easy–when all but one die in a household, it is the survivor.\n\nIn an interview with Makiko's assistant, he reveals how dedicated Makiko was to the project, but also how odd she acted doing research. In her interviews, she unknowingly changed personas depending on who she was talking to. This oddity is magnified by her fixation on Hisako herself. An excerpt from Makiko's novel makes this obsession apparent. Hisako's character asks Makiko’s character not to come to her house on the day of the birthday party. Describing Hisako in detail, Saiga creates a picture of Hisako as \"seeing\" the world differently due to being blind. In an interview with the housekeeper’s daughter, she recounts that she once saw Hisako swinging with a big, eerie smile, unnerving her. In a change of interviewees, the detective recounts his experience. He is also suspicious of Hisako and knew at first glance that she was guilty of the murders. The narrative is altered again with the interview of Sei-ichi, Makiko Saiga's eldest brother. In an off-beat manner, he asserts that the Aosawas had it coming due to their fame.\n\nIn another interview, a young master talks of a man who turns out to be the nameless man that delivered the poisoned drinks to the Aosawas. Ultimately, he was arrested and charged. However, the young master is not convinced of this outcome. The young man was private and interested in Buddhism, particularly the third eye, a concept of seeing past the ordinary world. In a perspective change, the unnamed narrator interviews someone who was a kid at the time of the murders and was friendly with the young man to the point of calling him \"Big Brother\". He admits Big Brother was troubled, and oftentimes heard a voice he described as a white flower. He does not believe that Big Brother committed the act alone. Many clues are left unsolved, and the people of K— think the case was closed with an insufficient resolution. A poem called \"Eugenia\" was left by the perpetrator, but no one can decipher its meaning. The man called Big Brother delivered the drink but had no motive to kill, and Hisako Aosawa witnessed the entirety of the poisoning but cannot give any tangible details. Decades later there is still a search for the truth among long-held beliefs and the sour feelings of the people living in the seaside city of K—.\n\nLiterary elements\n\nStructure \nRiku Onda creates complexity with three converging storylines, thus creating the effect of a story within a story. The original events of the day that the Aosawa tragedy occurred, descriptions of the interviews and writings of Makiko Saiga’s novel a decade later, and the present-day interviews, over 30 years later, that read like one-sided transcripts. In the present, the interviews are without dialogue or the prompts from the interviewer, solely the responses of the interviewee are recorded. These interviews are told in multiperspectivity, a technique showing differing experiences of the same events. These narrated chapters intermingle with other media, such as: an excerpt from Saiga's novel The Forgotten Festival, \"Scenes from a Life\" a chapter including snippets of events, diary entries, and newspaper articles. Onda uses a framing device, a significant element to ground the story at the beginning or end of a work, in the form of a poem called Eugenia, a reference to the Japanese publication title.\n\nGenre \nThe Aosawa Murders can be classified as shin honkaku or \"new orthodox\" and is derived from the popular honkaku genre. Honkaku which translates to \"orthodox\" refers to complex mysteries that can be logically solved. Albeit mostly similar, shin honkaku has looser genre boundaries and can include less formal literary devices.\n\nBackground\n\nInspiration \n\nRiku Onda had aspirations of becoming a writer since a young age. She began her writing career in her early twenties, quitting her job to become a novelist. The justification for her decision came from Ken'ichi Sakemi who made his successful debut as a writer at age 25, only a year older than Onda. Drawing inspiration from Michel Petrucciani's song \"Eugenia,\" Onda wrote a poem by the same name which helps frame the story of life and death seen in The Aosawa Murders. Her novel is set in the Hokuriku region where she lived as a child.\n\nTeigin Incident \nThe mass poisoning case in The Aosawa Murders references a crime that was committed in Japan known as the Teigin Incident. On January 26, 1948, twelve people died after a man disguised as a public health official entered a bank and urged the employees to ingest an immunization for the recent dysentery outbreak. The concoction turned out to be poison, and Sadamichi Hirasawa was arrested for mass homicide. The trial was prolonged as views about the evidence were largely divided. Hirasawa was eventually sentenced to execution by hanging though he pursued exoneration for 40 years before he died in prison at age 95. The Teigin Incident is remembered as one of Japan's most compelling mass murder cases. Decades later, paintings he created while on death row are showcased at a Tokyo gallery.\n\nReception\n\nAwards \nRiku Onda was presented with the Mystery Writers of Japan Award for Best Novel in 2006, as the 59th recipient. The award honors the best crime fiction of the previous year.\n\nThe Aosawa Murders was named one of the \"100 Notable Books of 2020\" by The New York Times Book Review, selecting notable works of literature.\n\nLiterature and translation \nJennifer Reese in The New York Times \"What to Read\" shortlist published February 20, 2020 praises Riku Onda for her engrossing, complex story. As Onda's first book to be published in English, Alison Watts delivers an accomplished translation. The story's non-linear approach to piecing together multiple perspectives creates a synaptic experience for the reader. Onda does not follow the rules of a traditional mystery novel. She conjures a world that is both separate but connected, leading the reader to connect remnants of the past and present.\n\nTara Cheesman in the Los Angeles Review of Books of March 25, 2020 tells of Onda's work as a locked-room puzzle, interwoven with a one-sided interview style and a nonlinear plot-line. Compared to a spigot left open, the unending flow of information to propel the plot is commended. Alison Watt's translation is also applauded, for her ability to hold the complicated form, and the puzzle of the prose itself. A masterful translation that keeps purposeful underdevelopment intact.\n\nJill Dobson in The Japan Society review summarizes Onda's intended effect of the novel: the revelation of a crime is oftentimes messy, and the story itself meanders. Simply finding the culprit is never the complete story.\n\nTerry Hong in Smithsonian BookDragon (January 2020) compliments Onda's unique style of clues that address both the motive and perpetrator of a crime, engaging readers in a hunt for the truth.\n\nMatthew Amster-Burton (February 2021) in the International Examiner describes Onda's work as delightfully evoking imagination while describing a rich setting. Onda brings into play themes of memory, and a reader favorite, used bookstores.\n\nKirkus Reviews (February 2020) praises Onda's work as crossing barriers between other works, and consistently perplexing the reader with wild turns and \"dark and dazzling\" atmosphere.\n\nReferences \n\nJapanese mystery novels\nMass poisoning\nJapanese literature\nCrime novels\nNovels set in Japan", "unikey": "The Aosawa Murders", "summary": "The Aosawa Murders is the first crime novel written by Riku Onda and was published in Japan in 2005.[1] Bitter Lemon Press later published an English translation in 2020.[2]\n", "outlines": ["Summary", "Literary_elements", "Background", "Reception", "References"], "contents": ["The Aosawa family is a prominent family within the city of K–.  As they celebrate a multi-generational birthday party, that admiration is sullied when an unnamed man presents the attendants with sake and soft drinks as a gift.

summer in japan is a monster the rainy season lifts bringing weeks of crushing wet heat its the kind of heat that leaves you tired listless and above all thirsty so thirsty that you might drink any beverage put in front of you even if it tastes a little odd even if its poisoned thats what happens in riku ondas captivating mystery the aosawa murders or at least thats what happened long before the book begins one hot summer in the 1970s in an unnamed town in ishikawa prefecture family and friends gather for a birthday party at the house of a wealthy local family the aosawas when a delivery of tainted sake and soda arrives nearly everyone drinks seventeen people die and the family and town are torn apart everyone with a connection to the crime is either dead or wants to forget the terrible day ever happened but decades later for reasons that are never revealed an anonymous interviewer sets out to solve the cold case the aosawa murders is told from many perspectives among them an eccentric author who wrote a book about the murders the authors assistant a police detective and hisako aosawa who survived the tragedy as a child and may know more than she lets on the most intriguing character is makiko saiga a neighbor who was present on the day of the murders and later wrote a controversial book about the events saiga has a keen eye for detail and for finding menace where a less traumahardened observer might see beauty here is saiga describing the sea of japan but the ocean here isnt refreshing at all gazing at it doesnt give you any sense of freedom or relief and the horizon is always close as if waiting for an opportunity to force its way onto land it feels like youre being watched and if you dare look away for just a moment the sea might descend upon you do you see what i mean not really and thats saigos charm you get the sense that onda especially enjoyed developing the obsessions the wounds and the small triumphs of this difficult character the aosawa murders is also notable for inspector teru a police detective whose role in solving the crime is oblique at best hes neither bumbling nor brilliant just an ordinary detective up against a unique case riku onda is a bestselling author in japan and this is her first book in english translation its no surprise her publisher would choose this taut atmospheric mystery and its a delight onda captures the suffocating summer days of central japan the tricks played by memory and even the joys of used bookstores which play a surprising role in the story in japanese however onda is known both as a mystery write and for comingofage stories like her masterpiece night picnic 2004 and her more recent honeybees and distant thunder about a piano competition which won the naoki prize in 2016 it would be wonderful if the aosawa murders opened the doors to more onda in english translation in the meantime this is a quick read that invites a close reread like the drink vending machines that

bncom bookshelf the aosawa murders by riku onda  translated by alison watts  release date feb 9 2020 this dark and dazzling novel defies easy categorization but consistently tantalizes and surprises bookshelf shop now amazon barnes  noble bncom a bizarre murder in 1970s japan continues to reverberate through the decades this book originally published in 2005 under the title eugenia is the first by onda to be translated into english after opening with a short unusually lyrical excerpt from the transcript of a police interview the book unfolds through chapters told from strikingly different perspectives the first narrator is makiko saiga who wrote a book about the crime in question the poisoning of 17 people at a birthday party at the aosawa family estate looking back on the murders 30 years later saiga who was a child at the time remembers it was a humid summer in a beautiful setting by the sea then several months after the crime a man who didnt seem to have any connection to the aosawas wrote up a confession and then hanged himself though skeptical the police took the opportunity to close the case saiga went on to research and publish the forgotten festival her only book about the crime as she winds up her story she implies that hisako the blind young aosawa heiress and the only survivor of the massacre might have been the killer you see its a very simple story if there are ten people in a house and nine die who is the culprit the next narrator is saigas assistant whos highly suspicious of her bosss motives an excerpt from the forgotten festival follows a thinly veiled dramatization in which saiga places her younger self at the scene of the crime and implicates a man she sees as the messenger of death subsequent sections focus on the housekeepers daughter the detective saigas older brother and others on the way to the surprising conclusion the domino effect of the murder on the community and the nation as well as the swirl of uncertainty concerning the way its narratives are shaped gives the book a striking resonance this dark and dazzling novel defies easy categorization but consistently tantalizes and surprises 6 pub date feb 9 2020

awardwinning author onda riku to be published in english is prefaced by a transcript of a police interview with aosawa hisako the sole survivor of a mass murder that has claimed the rest of her family hisako the obvious suspect is blind how could she have carried out a mass poisoning the rest of the novel unfolds from this basic premise following multiple viewpoints a technique that recalls akutawagas 1922 story in a bamboo grove the inspiration for kurosawas rashomon the aosawas a prominent local family in an unnamed but atmospherically described coastal town hold joint birthday celebrations for several family members a gift of sake is delivered along with soft drinks for the children in the name of a friend of the family the drinks are used for the birthday toast a local girl saiga makiko and her two brothers arrive late to the celebrations and find a ghastly scene of writhing bodies and the stink of vomit seventeen people die an extensive police investigation begins the family friend has no connection to the delivery and the enquiry stalls then a man known to be mentally disturbed hangs himself and leaves a suicide note claiming to have delivered the poisoned drinks despite the lack of motive the evidence confirms his confession the case is closed and yet local people are left empty and dissatisfied even depressed because they still couldnt make sense of why all those people had died p 35 the logistics of the murder have been clarified but the truth of it remains essentially unresolved and at its centre is the blind aosawa daughter hisako and her memory of the old dark blue room as a young woman saigamakiko is still haunted by her childhood discovery of the horrific crime scene she is driven to return to her former hometown and research the murders as way of dealing with the trauma which was still with me like a sediment that had settled deep down inside  over time this sense of unease built up and felt more solid p 19 she publishes a book about the murders the forgotten festival which she frankly describes as fiction nobody knows what the truth is it never even occurred to me to wonder if what i wrote was the truth p 23 in the first chapter an older makiko reflects on her experience at the time of the murders and the process of writing the book eleven years later responding to questions posed by an unnamed interviewer the meandering narrative moves through conversations between people who are linked in various ways to the event and the interviewer an excerpt from makikos book file notes and firstperson reminiscences there is no clear single point of view although the reader has the impression that the mysterious interviewer is working through all the evidence at a much later date as if piecing together an intricate puzzle every viewpoint is partial and open to question does the passing of time blur memory or does distance from the emotional impact of events provide a clearer view onda seems to undermine the convention of much although by no means all crime fiction that there is a truth to be neatly revealed whether by logical deduction oldfashioned shoeleather or fancy forensic techniques the truth of a murder she seems to say goes much deeper than simply who did it back to reviews share this 1314 cornwall terrace london nw1 4qp infojapansocietyorguk 020 7935 0475 become a member join
