{"id": 71284256, "key": "2023 USFL season", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%20USFL%20season", "text": "The 2023 USFL season was the second season of the United States Football League. The regular season started on April 15 and ended on June 18. The postseason began on June 24 and ended with the 2023 USFL Championship Game on July 1. The league expanded the locations their teams play to four total stadiums, adding Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan, and Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nWith the league beginning its second season on April 15, the USFL became the first spring league since the World League of American Football to complete its first season and return for a second.\n\nBackground\nDuring the 2022 season, many were concerned about the hub model and attendance figures in Birmingham for non-Stallions games. While the league started strong with 17,500 fans in attendance for the first game, featuring the local Stallions vs New Jersey Generals, they did not release figures for the other 39 regular-season games, which appeared to be played in a mostly-empty stadium. The poor attendance and the league's inability to connect with fans in most of their city-named teams' markets was believed to hurt league image and credibility amongst casual and mainstream football fans.\n\nOn June 27, 2022, Fox Sports confirmed to Sports Business Journal that the USFL would return for another season in 2023, after a \"profitable\" first season, with an estimated annual revenue of $7.5 million. There would be no team expansion, and the league would continue to use a hub model. Both Fox and NBC were happy with the first season play quality, joint production and the viewership number, while acknowledge the sparse in-person attendance. The USFL promised to play 2023 season in two to four cities, and the USFL parent company, Fox, hired investment bank Allen & Company to find minority investors to help fund the league's expansion into local markets.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2022 USFL co-founder, Brian Woods, has resigned from his role as the league CEO \"for family reasons\". It would later be revealed that he was launching a spring football league for high school players.\n\nAfter the season the league saw ten of its coaches join XFL teams, while some players chose to leave the USFL and join the rival league, including All-USFL and Championship Game Most Valuable Player Victor Bolden and quarterback Luis Perez, who went on to become the XFL Championship Game MVP. Nevertheless, 180 players from the 2022 season got invited to NFL tryouts, while 69 players signed with NFL teams and 13 players finished the 2022 NFL season on active 53-man NFL rosters. 2022 season MVP KaVontae Turpin signed with Dallas Cowboys and finished the 2022 NFL season as a Pro Bowler.\n\nLocations\n\nThe league stated its intention to expand the locations in which teams play, from one (Birmingham, Alabama) in the previous season to two or four. In November 2022, the league announced an agreement with Birmingham to continue hosting two of the league's eight teams, the Stallions and the Breakers, at Protective Stadium.\n\nOn November 15, 2022, the league announced that it had secured an agreement to play games at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium (formerly known as the Liberty Bowl) in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThe league contacted two stadiums in Michigan, Ford Field in Detroit and Rynearson Stadium in Ypsilanti, as potential locations for a North Division hub, with the Panthers as the host team. It was later revealed that Ford Field would be the home of the Michigan Panthers and Philadelphia Stars, while Rynearson Stadium would host the teams' practices.\n\nOn January 25, 2023, the league announced that the New Jersey Generals and the Pittsburgh Maulers (who sported a new gold-and-black uniform color scheme to emphasize the team's Pittsburgh identity) would play their home games at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, with the Generals as the host team. The stadium will also be the site of both the North Division playoff game and the 2023 USFL Championship Game, as it was in 2022.\n\nTeams\nOn November 15, 2022, in conjunction with its agreement to play at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium, the USFL announced that the Memphis Showboats would be replacing the Tampa Bay Bandits for the 2023 season. The seven other teams in the league returned as they were in 2022.\n\nPlayers\nFor the 2023 season, each USFL team started training camp with 58-men rosters, with a mandatory cut down to 54 and then a last cut down to 50. The final rosters are 40 active players and 10 inactive players on game days. The league also started a partnership with HUB Football for the 2023 season for players tryouts.\n\nCompensation\nOn December 15, 2022, USFL player representatives (United Football Players Association and United Steelworkers) and the league parent company FOX Sports tentatively agreed on a new three-year collective bargaining agreement starting at the 2023 season, six months after the league players voted to unionize. The proposed agreement increases minimum salaries and provides a stronger benefits package than they previously received, and slightly higher than most XFL salaries. USFL players' minimum salaries will be $5,350 per week, up from the current $4,500 per week payout ($2,500 for inactive players) and $150 a week toward 401K contributions, while weekly performance bonuses will be cancelled. During training camp, all USFL players will get $850 a week. Continuing as a benefit from the 2022 season, USFL players and staff are still able to receive a college degree \"tuition-free and debt-free\", through a partnership with for-profit universities Strategic Education's Capella University and Strayer University.\n\nDraft\n\nThe 10-round 2023 USFL College Draft took place on February 21, 2023, while draft pool included over 3,000 eligible players. The first overall pick was decided by the winner of the Week 10 game between the 1–8 Pittsburgh Maulers and 1–8 Michigan Panthers. The Panthers were victorious 33–21. The New Jersey Generals had their 1st round selection moved to the last pick in the draft and their rounds 2 to 5 picks were penalized due to \"a violation of offseason roster management rules\". Michigan State offensive lineman Jarrett Horst was the first overall pick.\n\nPlayer movement\n\n On January 27, it was reported that former NFL first-round pick linebacker Reuben Foster signed with the Pittsburgh Maulers.\n On February 8, the Showboats signed quarterback Ryan Willis after he was released from the XFL's St. Louis Battlehawks.\n On February 18, the Stars re-signed quarterback Case Cookus after a short stint with the NFL's Los Angeles Rams.\n On February 20, the Stars inked former NFL first-round pick, receiver Corey Coleman.\n On February 22, Grey Cup champion quarterback McLeod Bethel-Thompson announced he would leave the CFL and that he had signed with the New Orleans Breakers.\n On April 11, Birmingham Stallions sign tight end Thaddeus Moss, the son of Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss, and 2019 National Champion.\n On April 14, all teams finalized their mandatory 50-man rosters cut down.\n On April 19, Isaiah Zuber re-signed with the Houston Gamblers following a stint with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n On April 20, the Birmingham Stallions signed former New Orleans Breakers quarterback Kyle Sloter following an injury to J'Mar Smith.\n\nCoaching changes\nOn March 15, all teams announced their coaching staffs for the upcoming season.\n\nRule changes\nFor the 2023 season, the league intends to change clock rules so every game will be played in a 180-minute window. Also, kickoffs will be from the 20-yard line and halftime is trimmed to 10 minutes, while the Championship Game will remain at 30 minutes.\n\nStandings\n\nSeason structure\n\nPreseason\nTraining camp started on March 21 in each team specific hub, a day later than what they had scheduled last year.\n\nRegular season\nThe league announced that it would retain the previous season's scheduling format, with the regular season starting in April and ending in June and the playoffs extending to early July. The schedule was released on February 7, 2023.\n\nPostseason\nThe postseason will be a four-team playoff, with the top 2 teams in each division making the postseason. On January 28, it was announced that the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio, will host the 2023 USFL Championship.\n\nSeason schedule\nAll games produced by NBC Sports will stream on Peacock unless otherwise noted. Viewership figures for streaming platforms are released four weeks after the event, all times listed are in ET.\n\nWeek 1\n\nWeek 2\n\nWeek 3\n\nWeek 4\n\nWeek 5\n\nWeek 6\n\nWeek 7\n\nWeek 8\n\nWeek 9\n\nWeek 10\n\nPlayoffs\nThe playoffs started on June 24 and 25 and ended with the championship game on July 1.

In April 14, Upper Deck Announced as the exclusive trading card partner and Antigua Apparel named an \"Authentic Sideline Apparel Partner Of The USFL\".\n\nOther USFL's sponsors include: FedEx, Gatorade, Henry Schein, Jersey Mike's Subs, Mars, Molson Coors, Rocket Mortgage, T-Mobile and Wendy's.\n\nMedia \nThis was the second year of the three-year rights deal agreement between NBC Sports along with Fox Sports (Fox doesn't have to pay a rights fee due to being one of the owners of the league).\n\nTelecasts for the 2023 season will air on Fox, FS1, NBC, USA Network and CNBC. Fox aired 17 regular season games and 1 semi-final, NBC broadcast 7 full regular season games plus the first quarter of 1 game on June 10 then the remaining 2 hours of another game on June 11 (originally scheduled to air 9 full games), 1 semi-final and the Championship game, and FS1 and USA Network broadcast 7 games each, and CNBC broadcast the remaining one of the games on NBC caused by a weather delay on June 10. Unlike the 2022 season, in order to increase the leagues exposure, Peacock will not air exclusive games (however it aired an hour of exclusive game coverage on Sunday June 11). Instead, Peacock will simply simulcast all games produced by NBC Sports. An emphasis will also be made on having high-profile events serve as lead-ins to the league, with some games following NASCAR and Major League Baseball broadcasts on Fox or the Kentucky Derby on NBC.\n\nCurt Menefee and Joel Klatt will return as Fox's lead commentary team for USFL coverage. Kevin Kugler and Mark Sanchez serve as the second broadcast team. Brock Huard will report from the sidelines during selected games. Devin Gardner will also appear on select games.\n\nThe NBC crew features Jac Collinsworth and Paul Burmeister handling play-by-play duties alongside analysts Jason Garrett, Michael Robinson and Cameron Jordan. Zora Stephenson, Corey Robinson, Lewis Johnson, and Caroline Pineda are the sideline reporters. Colt McCoy, Kyle Rudolph and Anthony Herron are the additional analysts for selected games.\n\nViewership \nIn millions of viewers\n\n* One decimal place is shown in table but three decimal places are used in all calculations.* Viewership figures for games streaming on Peacock were not released.\n\nInternational broadcasters \nNBC Sports, FOX Sports and DAZN will broadcast live international coverage of the 14-game schedule, including the playoffs and the championship game (excludes coverage in the U.S. and the 14 countries with separate broadcast deal). In the United Kingdom and Ireland it will be will be broadcast through Sky Sports, in Australia by FOX Sports Australia, in Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden by Viaplay in Hungary by Network 4 and in the Philippines by Elite.\n\nGames involving the Michigan Panthers have been broadcast by radio station WJR, which covers a substantial portion of the midwestern United States and Southern Ontario in Canada with a 50,000-watt signal.\n\nReception\nThe USFL open the season strong with between 15,000 to 20,000 fans in Memphis and ~17,000 in Birmingham. Alas, the league second return to play was also marked with the same complaints from the previous season of a lack of fans in the stands in other locations (5,000-8,000 fans in Canton for week 1 and approximately 7,500 fans in the Panthers opener) or \"neutral site games\", while the league announced \"it will be maintaining their policy in partnership with their venues of not releasing attendance figures\" during the season. President of Football Operations Daryl Johnston acknowledged the issue before the championship game and said: \"it does motivate us to make sure we get our eight teams into their home markets as quickly as we can, but we can't rush it\".\n\nBefore the season, some fans felt disrespected of the USFL commercials to promote the league's return, which took aim at the XFL. Nonetheless, the USFL week 1 ratings outdraws XFL Week 9, as the USFL averaged 789,500 viewers across four games with the XFL posting an averaged of 588,250 viewers across four games, although three USFL games were on broadcast TV while three XFL games were on cable. USFL average viewership in 2023 was down 16% from its debut season to 601,000 and 3% lower than the XFL's 2023 season, despite having 28 over the air network games compare to the XFL's eight. Johnston himself expressed disappointment and anger that the USFL was comparable to the XFL in ratings for the 2023 season, dismissing the XFL as \"no competition\" to the \"far superior\" USFL and questioning how \"to be on par with our competition from a ratings standpoint in Year 2, I'm still trying to figure out: How did that happen? (...) they're not even close.\"\n\nContrary to the 2022 season, most markets decided to cover the teams locally, while the third week of games received tentative praise from national outlet, with Bill Shea of The Athletic writing an article titled \"I attended a USFL game so you don't have to (but maybe you should?)\" after attending a game between Michigan Panthers and New Jersey Generals.\n\nThe league approach to adopt technology got rave reviews, especially for the use of first down measurements technology.\n\nSignees to the NFL\nThe following is  players signed with NFL teams at one point following their involvement with the USFL in 2023:\n\nNote the following list notes the status of players as of August 29, 2023, the final day for NFL teams to make preseason cuts.\n\nSee also\n2023 XFL season\n\nReferences\n\n2023 USFL season\nUnited States Football League (2022)\nUSFL", "unikey": "2023 USFL season", "summary": "The 2023 USFL season was the second season of the United States Football League.[1][2] The regular season started on April 15 and ended on June 18.

underway but there are many questions about the leagues direction and the moves the usfl makes will determine whether the league can go from surviving to thrivingis the new usfl bucking historysome would argue that the usfl is bucking its own history by acting as if its 2022 season was an inaugural affair the league is hyping season 2 but the united states football league already had three seasons decades agoas chronicled and reported here frequently the awkwardness of the current usfl not embracing the original league is not a fault of the usfls new leadership for legal reasons they have been unable to lean on their historyfactual semantics aside the main part of history that the new usfl challenges is the inevitable fate that has doomed similar entities in the pasthistory has not favored nonnfl pro football leagues in the united states the canadian football league through all of its trials and tribulations has weathered the storms of the past and the present day to stand the test of timebut in america the graveyards are filled with nonnfl pro leagues thats why understandably so anytime a new pro football league has popped up on the scene most people expect and predict an eventual demise you cant blame them after all they are only going by the history books because no one else has defied death in this landscapethe new iteration of the usfl is popping champagne after completing its 2022 season some would argue that they have every right to celebrate the accomplishment after all they are the first spring pro football league in the united states that has finished an entire season in recent times excluding the mostlyforgotten spring league on fox last yearsimply not collapsing immediately qualifies as a success compared to many other doomed entities in this space especially considering what happened to the aaf and the xfl on two separate occasionshowever it would be best if you quantified the new usfls accomplishments properlyfirstly there have been pro football leagues in the united states that have completed an entire season two of them were under the watch of usfl executive brian woods the aforementioned tsl on fox in 2021 and the fxfl the fall xperimental football league got to year three but its collapse fits the ancient saying if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it does it make a soundthe united football league completed four seasons from 20092012 well kind of the ufl limped their way badly through year four they never got beyond eight games in a season and failed to field more than five teamsthe league barely got any attention it didnt help that they foolishly attempted to generate interest by playing in the fall during the nfl and college season most sports fans forget or even know that the ufl existed maybe some remember the late marty schottenheimer and jim fassel winning championships or josh mccown daunte culpepper and jeff garcia slinging passes in ufl games or that denzel washingtons son john david played in the league but the league is barely a footnote a decade after they completed several seasonswhen most people talk about failed spring pro football leagues in the united states surprisingly the nfls attempt at having a secondary league in the spring is glossed over the brainchild of former commissionerpaul tagliabue as a spring developmental leaguethe world league of american football fielded ten teams six teams in the united states birmingham new yorknew jersey san antonio orlando raleigh durham and sacramento three teams in europe barcelona london and frankfurt germany and one in canada the montreal machinethe wlaf started play in march of 1991 and lasted only two seasons before being repackaged as nfl europe the scaleddown and remodeled nflbacked league aired games on several prominent tv outlets including fox and completed 13 seasons before discontinuing operations in 2007so technically for the record books the 2022 version of the usfl is the first spring pro football league in the united states that paid all its players to finish a season since the 2001 version of the xfl and their journey into season 2 makes them the first thoroughly american spring pro football league to do so since the original usfl in the 80scompleting a season is an accomplishment by the fox sportsowned version of the usfl but its not uncharted territory and its been done before getting to a second or a third season is excellent but the type of league you are when you get there is of utmost importance other leagues got to that point but they didnt excel when they didthe new usfl has a lot going for it having a network as the leagues owner certainly helps and perhaps the completion of its season with another one on the horizon will help engender football fans who were dismissive of the leagues existence in 2022 but other crucial factors in play will determine if the usfl can truly buck history and lastwill the usfl go into team markets next seasonthis topic has been covered ad nauseam here at usflnewshub and by so many others who have been tracking the usfl everyone knows that for the usfl to maximize the leagues interest and become a traditional fullyfledged pro football league they need to go into their teams marketsthe usfls most prominent weaknesses were its poor attendance in its hub setting in birmingham for nonstallions games and the leagues inability to connect with fans in most of their citynamed teams markets the artificial nature of a pittsburgh or houstonbased team for example playing in the south all season didnt help the leagues legitimacy and the embarrassingly lowattended games also hurt the leagues image and credibility amongst casual and mainstream football fansfox sports knows this its why league executives like daryl moose johnston have publicly discussed the possibility of a potential second hub in a northern city if the usfl cant find a way to put all eight teams in their citiesnew york posts business reporterjosh kosmanrecently reported that the fox sportsownedunited states football leaguehad hired investment bank allen  co to find minority investors to help fund the leagues expansion into local markets foxs reported plan is to raise between 150 million and 200 millionfox cant repeat the same setup for the usfl it had in birmingham in 2022 and they wont say it publicly but actions speak louder than words and its the reason why they are seeking significant capitalhaving a second hub in a northern city like perhaps in philly would be a compromise if the league cant go into their markets however its not necessarily a happy medium a step forward yes but a baby step at bestthe usfl product as evidenced by an engaged crowd in the leagues championship game was a much better tv product and it showed up in the ratings the audience grew as the game continued until its climax it helped that the stallions made the big game but its no surprise that the one market with a team set up shop in their city garnered the most interest the stallions had a 109 household rating locally for the gamemoving seven of the leagues teams minus the league champs birmingham into their respective markets is easier said than done especially if you dont have individual team owners to pick up the operation costs its why funding is needed to cover the cost of paying for team employees headquarters training and practice facilities venue leases travel costs etc etc etcthe sooner all usfl teams are in their local markets the better because there is another spring pro football league coming with deep pockets and a strong tv partner headed into markets immediatelyhow will the usfl deal with the xfelephant in the roomthe usfl is fully aware that the spring pro football league landscape will have some significant competition and fox has already taken preemptive measures to prepare for the arrival of redbird capital dany garcia and dwayne the rock johnsons xflby the time the new usfl presents its 2023 followup season in midapril xfl 30 will have already arrived on the scene on abc and espn the usfl hasnt officially announced the start of their 2023 season but it will start as the new xfl is finishing theirsthe xfl will play in all eight team markets right out the gate and they will be doing it before the usfl does the usfl may have gotten to the dance first but the xfl will immediately be dancing with all their dance partners they have an opportunity to connect to all their cities better than the usfl did in 2022the jury is out on the type of league the xfl will be under new leadership but they have a ton of financial backing and plenty of promotional power with dwayne johnson and disney the early word from sources is that the xfl plans on paying their quarterbacks upwards of six figures per season with the average player salary being in the neighborhood of 65000the feeling amongst the football community and player agents is that the new xfl has several advantages over the usfl besides potentially higher salaries chief among them is the xfls positioning on the calendar with their league ending its season in late april it creates a better window for players to recover from playing an entire season in the spring and enhances their odds of latching onto nfl teams and making them in septembermany players shined in the 2022 usfl season who are undoubtedly deserving of nfl opportunities but with nfl rosters currently filled at the maximum of 90 the feeling is that the doorway for usfl players onto an nfl camp roster is much more challenging than it would have been three months ago the aaf and xfl had over two dozen players each who got onto nfl rosters when their seasons concluded many of those players had ample time to prove themselves and are still on nfl rosters years laternfl training camps dont start until later this month things could pick up for 2022 usfl players later this summerbased on past spring pro football league success 54 aaf signings58 xfl and conversations with football personnel i fully expect 4050 plus usfl players to sign onto nfl teams when camps start and during the preseasonthe question will be if there is enough time for players to stick joining nfl teams late in the processthe usfl has already countered the possibility of player defections to an enticing xfl option by structuring their player contracts with secondyear clauses to prevent players from jumping ship to any league not named the nflits not only an intelligent play but a necessary one by the usfl and in a way it could also benefit the leagues continuity for year two all eight usfl teams will likely keep most of their best players for next seasonbirmingham stallions head coach skip holtz recently told the patrick netherton show that usfl team rosters would expand from 50 40 actives  10 practice squad to 75 players in the offseason holtz also stated that usfl teams would be conducting offseason team activities starting in their local markets this octoberadding 25 extra players per roster for all eight teams means 200 new players could gain entry into the usfl several months before training camp and season 2 begins in 2023a good number of those players could be streetfree agents who didnt join the league in 2022 or players who miss the cut on nfl teams active or practice squad rosters this septemberbut the usfl will have competition for these players from the arriving xfl who will be in the market for the same players xfl 30 is currently conducting player showcases across the country the league has worked out 600 players at three showcases they have three left this summer they may find some hidden gems but theres no doubt that their primary targets will be veteran free agents who opted not to play in the usfl and are currently not on nfl rosters and players who are presently on nfl rostersthe bottom line for both the usfl and xfl will be presenting a league that players will want to play for over the other college football players and young pro football players will all benefit from the existence of both leaguessalary and the playing calendar could favor the xfl in their pitch to agents and players but perhaps added funding could lead to the usfl paying above 45k per season to its players they might have to in the long run in their battle with the upcoming xflthe competition between the usfl and xfl could extend beyond the players its no secret that coaches like bob stoops and wade phillips chose the xfl over potentially coaching in the usfl and sources have indicated to usflnewshub for several weeks that one of the usfls prominent defensive coordinators has already accepted the same position on rod woodsons xfl staff woodson is teamed up with joseph clinkscales of the tampa bay banditswho departed the usfl to assume the director of player personnel role with las vegasthe first of many strikes between both leagues in the coming weeks and monthsmission accomplished by the 2022 version of the usfl they are headed towards an entire offseason and a season 2 a world that spring pro football league enthusiasts havent experienced for a long time phase one

receiver and will get plenty of touches in the passing game adrian hardy and michael dereus return from last season but dont nearly have as much experience deon cain is a name to watch out for as he is a speed receiver and one of four new wideouts in the grouptight end 2jace sternberger thaddeus mossthis position group may be the most exciting unit to watch out for on birminghams roster jace sternberger joins the team after stints in the nfl with the green bay packers and pittsburgh steelers moss meanwhile is the son of nfl legend randy moss and is freaky athletic with outstanding hands in the passing gameboth players starred in college with sternberger being a consensus allamerican and moss winning a national championship in 2019 at lsu both are superb athletes that complement each

combination of the xfl and usfl in 2023 over 800 players will be playing pro football in the nfl offseason this year the smoke will settle after the super bowl but the show for players and the pro football world is far from overa snapshot of america in 2023after sundays super bowl there will be 20 consecutive weekends of nationallytelevised spring footballthe xfl season begins february 18 the usfl picks up april 15 and continues into julyi am pretty sure weve never seen that before kevin seifert seifertespn february 10 2023theres never been a better time to be a pro or college football player than nowthe football ecosystem is changing right before our very eyes and theres serious room for more growth and expansion in what is becoming an evolving land of playing options for football playersthe past versus the present and futureto know where you are headed you must know where youve been and ultimately to understand why there has always been a need for nonnfl pro leaguesaccording to data released by the ncaa only 16 percent of all drafteligible college players make the national football league thousands of players from hundreds of football universities end up on the outside looking in on top of that you combine that reality with the fact that the average nfl career is four years as a result you have historically seen a landscape filled with players with extremely limited

have had to make the tough decision of hanging up their cleats while they are still in their playing prime young people in their twenties who have been playing organized football since childhood are forced to abandon their dreamsfast forward to the present and career options for football players are expanding immensely the existence of a growing field of professional playing opportunities coupled with the boom of revenue streams for college athletes through nil has created a new world of possibilities especially for college football players who not only have income more control and security but now have a better chance to extend their playing careers once they finish up playing in school and maybe in the notsodistant future some college athletes could decide to turn pro early as another pathway to the nfl the same way west virginia standout kenny robinson and current pittsburgh steelers db did when he was drafted by the carolina panthers after playing in xfl 2020alternative league optionsfootball players in the united states have always had the great choice of playing up north in the wonderful cfl although its come with a catch in the form of a mandated foreignplayer ratioon top of that are the challenges of transitioning to living in a new country and playing in a league that is very different from college and pro football in the us nevertheless the canadian football league has been a timetested safe haven for americans looking to keep their proplaying dreams alivehowever new doors have opened and reopened outside of canada for playerstheres the recent and continuous growth of the european league of football which will now field 17 teams when season three commences in june and entities like the indoor football league fan controlled football and the reborn arena football league arriving in 2024 are additional pathways for playershowever ultimately its the existence of the xfl and usfl that can facilitate the most significant and positive change moving forward and one could argue that its already happeningthe xfl versus the usfl a winwin scenario for playersthe usfl owned and operated by fox and the xfl which relaunches saturday february 18th on abcespn  fx are changing the game for players who want to continue or start their pro football careers in americain 2023 both leagues will employ over 800 players 808 thats not to mention all the coaches and employees who are gainfully employed due to the existence of the xfl and usflhowever the point of emphasis here is focusing on the players after all without them theres no reason to have these leaguesfor however long it lasts over eight hundred players will be playing professional football during the spring in the united states in 2023 and they will get fantastic exposure and coverage on the most prominent networks possibleover a dozen players who have signed up to play in the xfl and usfl in 2023 finished the nfl season on practice squads some of them rather than reup with nfl teams on futures contracts have decided to play spring pro football in an effort to get playing time and game film to better their chances of getting another crack in the nflwhether or not the majority of the xfl or usfl players make nfl rosters doesnt matter the fact that football athletes are getting a chance to play professionally is a victory on its own and the progression to the nfl or a pathway back is an added bonusits more about the opportunity than the results after all there are no guarantees but the results of producing a pipeline have been pretty promisingxfl 2020 success

turpin the downandout tcu standout revived his career and he is now a pro bowl nfl player all thanks to the existence of the usflthe platform the xfl and usfl are providing now is invaluable to playersanother positive byproduct of the two leagues existence is that they are forced to compete for football talent which in turn gives players more freedom and optionsimproved options and pay for players in the xfl and usflthere are now 16 pro football teams that will play this spring during the nfl offseason because of this new reality players have multiple choicesnearly 70 usfl 2022 players exercised that freedom and joined the xfl 49 of them have made final xfl 2023 rostersthe players who havent made an xfl roster in 2023 still have the usfl as a viable possibility there are now two doors to explore see quarterback ryan willis who missed on his goal of being a starter with st louis and now lands another shot at starting with the usfls memphis showboatsinstead of asking for his release willis mightve chosen to stick it out in st louis and hope for playing time later in the season but with the usfl out there he could explore another playing opportunity elsewhere theres no doubt that willis sent out feelers to usfl teams before his exit with the battlehawks became officialsome usfl players dipped their toes in the xfl waters but ultimately returned to where they played a year ago see former seattle dragonsphiladelphia stars cb channing stribling who was drafted by the st louis battlehawks but then decided to return to phillyplayers have options now and are not at the mercy of these upstart pro league entities who in the past could offer the bare minimum because usually one of these leagues was the only show in town now there are twocompetition between both leagues has forced them to up their game in how players are treatedthe failures of past spring leagues to survive and honor commitments have led to the formation of the united football players association an entity designed as a safeguard for players who play in these leagues within a year the ufpa helped facilitate a players union representation with the united steelworkers ultimately what has happened is its led to a collective bargaining agreement between the usfl and its playersas part of the new cba active usfl players will see an increase in weekly salary and better benefits with more living arrangement costs covered by the leaguea more even playing field for players has created equality for those who play in both the xfl and usflheres where the player salary figures stand for

players on active lists for a game also has a positive impact on player safety and quality of play it gives a coaching staff more flexibility and depth the nfl had played with 46 players for many years and has now expanded the gameday roster to 48 the usfl will have forty players active in 2023in year two of their cba the usfls active list will increase from 40 to 42 with eight players on the weekly inactive list thats a positive step forwardthere are some exceptions in the xfl average base player pay for certain quarterbacks while the league hasnt released those specific figures the football ops team has publicly stated that specific quarterbacks would make above the median salary the early word through sourcing is that quarterbacks jordan taamu and brett hundley for example are being paid over six figures for the 2023 xfl seasonits easy to be dismissive of these salary numbers especially if you are comparing them to the almighty nfl but the opportunity to play pro football and get game film on a national stage is worth its weight in gold and 50 plus thousand dollars or more for a few months work is respectable compensationwhy the usfl and xfl could work this timethere are no guarantees that the xfl and usfl can coexist and survive over the long haul the two entities are standing in coach others way even though both leagues seasons barely overlap the xfl plays from february to may and the usfl is situated from midapril to julynevertheless the odds are always against these entities and historically havent been favorable you can do all the right things on and off the field and still not make it in the long run due to financeshowever there are reasons to believe that one or both of these leagues can still stand in a few years and thats because the landscape of sports on television has changed greatlyfootball leagues are coming out of the woodwork scrambling to launch and relaunch rapidly because they know that streaming services but more specifically tv networks are looking for dedicated live viewership that can produce audiences that will not change the channel for three hours thats what the live content of sports leagues provides that other programming doesnttv ratingsthe xfl in 2020 on fox abc and espn and the usfl on fox and nbc in 2022 produced respectable viewership numbers especially when you look at it in comparison and context to other longestablished sports leaguesxfl ratings three years agothrough only five weeks in 2020 10 games xfl games on espnabc averaged an audience of 1893000 viewers on abc alone the average was 21 million on fox the xfl averaged 24 million over six telecasts in fairness those numbers are slightly inflated because of the high week one viewer totalsfor example the 29 fox sunday afternoon telecast between tampa and new york averaged 339 million viewers the largest audience for a nonnfl pro football game since week 6 of the original xfl in 2001 367 millionmuch was made through the media in 2020

aired on foxnbc during the tenweek regular season averaged just over a million viewers per telecast on the usfls two leading networks 1008000 not an earthshattering number but very respectable for a brandnew league trying to establish a foothold in a crowded sports marketthe tv rating for theusfl 2022championship game on fox averaged 1517 million viewers the game scored a 092 household rating it was the usfls highest individual game rating on fox since itss opening week simulcast in april 175m on fox an impressive number showed that there was a chance for lasting powerusfl games on cable produced modest numbers averaging under 300000 viewers per game but in 2023 even those numbers are workablequite frankly fox and disney are back at the table now in spring pro football because of the success and overall potential the xfl showed in 2020while espn and abc will get the headlines for airing xfl 2023 games a significant reason why disney is rolling with the xfl again is to build up fx and espn plus as live sports content entitiesthese robust networks see the value in spring pro football ten twenty years ago this concept would have struggled and ultimately did to make its mark but

news search nfl mlb nhl nba cfl stats daryl johnston executive vice president of football operations and jim popp director of player administration of the usfl were gracious enough to answer a few questions heading into tuesdays drafthow does this years draft different from last seasonsthe usfl had 280 players selected in last seasons draft with the main purpose to build rosters for the upcoming season from a pool of seasoned professional players this year the focus is on rounding out depth and adding talent to teams that already have their foundations in place by selecting from a pool of collegeeligible playersâall players for the 2023 usfl college draft must have been out of high school for at least three years waived their remaining college eligibility or have exhausted their college eligibilityâlast year players eligible for the draft were already under contract this season teams that select a player will retain the rights of that player until he decides to report to the team to negotiate a contract if the drafting team doesnt make an offer then the drafting team must relinquish the rights to the player via notification to the usfl league officejohnston last year the draft served a different purpose we were trying to fill the entire roster for eight teams through that so that was a much different approach in year one of building the league this one its just kind of getting into the traditional collegiate draft class thats coming up prior to your seasonhow do you deal with players concerned about getting drafted into nfljohnston thats the hard part we know youre a couplemonths away from going through something you dreamed about as a young boy we fully understand that our focus is on the back end of the nfl draft potential seventh round and preferred free agencytype guys our gms and scouts were at the college allstar games they understand the athlete that were looking for so that makes it a challenging part for us but were not doing it like last year everybody in the draft pool was under contractthis year youre selecting the player and you have the rights to that player moving forwardpopp ill add to that weve done our homework so the majority of players we draft probably wont be drafted by the nfl there could be some bubble guys that cross over theres no question but this is a chance to give an individual young man a dream come true that might not ever get drafted this might be the only time they get drafted so we provide that opportunity to them as wellplayers will know who owns their rights that do get drafted and several guys last year as much as we were trying to have players come to us they still wanted to go through with their pro day and at least about 50 percent of the pro days will be over with by the time we start training camp in march and out of that 50 guys will know how they do and what feedback they get from nfl teams a lot of them have waited for that moment once they got into college to do that pro day so they will already know what other options they have while they are going through their pro day and that will probably help them make their decisionhow do usfl teams approach the draftjohnston i think the big thing is that weve been able to be a little more specific in how each team addresses where their roster needs are last year you are going off a lot of unknowns there are some things we put in place this year that made us much better in our evaluation process and well be even better in year 3 but thats going to be the most important thing they know where they need to add depth from last yearpopp i do think each team will have a very unique path that they take some guys just talking to them are looking to get guys they can bring in immediately and then there are other teams where its really about the future because they got a lot of their team back and they would rather get the rights of players and maybe have them a year from now even if its for half a season this is what makes this draft fun because we really dont know which direction each team is going inwhats the roster makeup and can you talk about the new third qb rulepopp so 58 players go to training camp we will have a mandatory cut down to 54 and then a last cut down to 50 the final rosters will be 40 active players and 10 inactive players on game daysjohnston said injury concerns on game days could still be an issue because gameday active roster remains the same however johnston said the usfl will provide for teams to have a third quarterback available should the first two active quarterbacks suffer injuries on game days similar to what the san francisco 49ers endured in the nfc championship game where they were down to running back christian mccaffrey as the only healthy option at quarterbackjohnston we saw how that changed the game in the nfc championship game so mike pereira is going to create that old nfl third quarterback rule there was one version that mike really liked so well have a third quarterback dressed and inactive and if we lose our first two quarterbacks hell be able to enter the gamelast year 69 players were invited to nfl training camps and players like kavontae turpin had productive seasons is that a selling point for players this yearjohnston i think its huge we wore theâkavontae turpin story out laughs its a feelgood story ive been in the other two leagues weve had some success but we never had anything like that i never had a pro bowler i never had an allpro voted on by your peers so that was tremendous but theres some other good stories too demarquis gates is a great story in chicago hes tried this twice and hasnt been able to stick its just interesting you get a little older a little wiser and you fit into a system wellwe had over 180 players get invited to nfl tryouts and we have right around 13 players that are still on 53man rosters now and thats a big deal too that financially changes a young mans trajectory

alternative league superstar last season in the usfl has opted to return to the usfl it started with a tweet from case cookuss account asking if the blob needed a roommate in detroit soon after a tweet from the stars account made it official simply saying hes backcaptain cookus becomes cult hero in 2022the city of brotherly love has always been a bluecollar city that loves players who have a workmanlike mentality case cookus began the 2022 season firmly planted as the backup quarterback behind bryan scott an injury to scott in week three opened the door for cookus to take over as the starterbefore this happened case cookus had bounced around the nfl and cfl for two years with stints in new york with the giants denver minnesota las vegas edmonton and los angeles he never got much of a chance to learn and develop in an offense during that time he also had a brief stint in the spring league which proved important his brief stint with the generals led him to a contract with denver but it also gave him his first experience with bart andrusfrom backup to back in the spotlightcookus was no stranger to the spotlight his time at nau had him often in the forefront of football conversations in his area when cookus stepped in for the stars he did so with about six weeks in 2022 to learn that offense building on his previous knowledge in 2021 this helped cookus to come out firing and quickly he had fans forgetting all about bryan scott entering the game just before halftime cookus would complete 13 of 20 passes for 146 yards and 1 touchdown this began a solid run for cookushe would play in 8 games completing 130 of 208 passes for 1334 yards 12 touchdowns 5 interceptions and 22 carries for 217 yards and 1 touchdown this performance inspired fans and put his team squarely in the playoff picture his performance in the playoffs waned a bit from the level it once was in the regular seasonin two games his completion rate fell from 625 to 551 completing just over half his passes for 355 yards 3 touchdowns and 1 interception 5 carries for 43 yards and 1 touchdown he would ultimately end up sustaining a broken leg in the championship game giving way to kj costello who would throw two interceptions and fall 3 points short of a victory against the birmingham stallionscase cookus replaces luis perez in lashortly after the season he would follow luis perez in los angeles after perez was released sean mcvay added to the long list of alternative football league quarterbacks he has employed since being the head coach of the los angeles rams cookus signed on november 23rd or just days after a week 11 injury to matthew stafford at the time the rams were 38 with bryce petty as their top backup former alliance of american football passing touchdowns leader john wolford had suffered an injury himself after starting in staffords placecookus remained on the practice squad until his contract expired in january of 2023 when his season officially ended however the wait for philadelphia stars fans was far from over on the surface it made all the sense in the world for former united football league coach sean mcvay to bring case cookus back on a futures deal but the offer never came cookus remained a free agent and each day the fans continued to watch for any news of cookuss signinggiven his unrestricted free agent status there was a possibility he could have followed the path that paxton lynch kyle sloter luis perez and even bryan scott had and chased a chance with the xfl he may have and ultimately ended up returning to what he knew the stars have been able to resign nearly every player that made a brief trip back to the nfl only to be released the most significant question mark to this point was case cookusquarterback controversy in philadelphia not so fastgiven how everything has transpired it is not believed that bryan scott will be back to create any quarterback controversy with the stars case cookus likely walks into the 2023 season as the unquestioned starter looking to climb the alternative football league passing yards leaderboard after the 2022 season he stands 22nd in post2000 play just 4 yards behind the legend that is pj walker how amazing is it that pj walker threw for 1338 yards in only 5 gamesif he manages to just matches his 2022 average of 170 passing yards per start and starts all 10 games he could finish 2023 having leapfrogged some bigname players all the way up to the number 3 spot behind jordan taamu and luis perez the only two quarterbacks to stand above 3000 yards alreadybrandon silvers ryan willis kyle sloter and jmar smith could be names to watch top that 3000 mark this season with all of them standing at 1573 yards or more heading into the 2023 season kyle sloter looks to have a competition on his hands in arlington with drew plitt there ryan willis is the likely favorite in memphis even with cole kelley and brady white there brandon silvers seems the most likely to be challenged for his starting role with cole mcdonald breathing down his neck jmar smith is the incumbent in birmingham after a championship victory under his former college coachwhere does cookus stand on the leader boardscase cookus might be playing catchup on the yardage list but in the touchdown category he stands tied for 7th with 12 ahead of him are all names with xfl ties luis perez tops the list with 24 while silvers and taamu are tied at 19 which is impressive when you consider silvers hasnt played in any outdoor leagues since xfl2020 and taamu was in the usfl ryan willis stands at 13 and is his best competition in the usfl in 2023 as a pure passercould we see cookus in the top five for both categories in just two usfl seasons with so many variables itll be tough to tell until the dust settles but he certainly has a good chance of dramatically improving his standings on each list one thing is for certain fans are certainly excited that captain cookus

the eventual 2023 usfl champion emerge from this gamelast seasons opener between these teams was one of the best games of the season after losing starting quarterback alex mcgough eight offensive snaps into the season jmar smith led the stallions to a secondhalf comeback win in dramatic fashion 2824 at protective stadium in birmingham alabamaas the season progressed it became clear that the generals and stallions were two of the leagues best teams both made the playoffs one team was responsible for the usfls offensive player of the year generals running back darius victor and mvp former generals wide receiver kavontae turpin and the other won the 2022 championship stallionsif this years seasonopener in birmingham can come close to the kind of exciting one we watched last year theres reason to believe the stallions and generals might meet again  perhaps in the 2023 championship gamehow much better will mcgough smith and new jersey qb deandre johnson be in year 2generals coach mike riley and stallions coach skip holtz are fortunate to return quarterbacks who started games for them in the regular season and playoffs philadelphia stars bart andrus is the only other coach who can make such a claimhowever both needed to use more than one starting quarterback throughout the regular season  as did andrus  and depth at quarterback is essential its so essential in fact that the usfl has created a new rulethat allows for each team to carry an inactive quarterback on its roster in case of an emergency  such as losing two qbs in the same game to injuriesjohnson will look to solidify his position as the starter in rileys offense after splitting time with luis perez most of last year while holtz will almost certainly try to give both of his quarterbacks the chance to win the job outrightjohnson accounted for over 1000 yards of offense through the air and on the ground contributing six total tds and throwing just two interceptionssmith finished third in the league in passing yards with 1573 with 10 total tds and six interceptions while mcgough totaled just over 500 yards of offense but accounted for six tdsand just three interceptionsas quarterback play goes so does a teams fortune in the usfl an ability to take care of the ball will be at a premiumwhich new star emergesfamiliar names on both sides of the ball return but the stallions are loaded with former national title caliber and allamerican playersformer arizona linebacker and allamerican scooby wright former alabama running back bo scarbrough former texas am tight end and allamerican jace sternberger and former lsu tight end and national champion thad moss will all suit up for the stallions on saturday nightsunday michigan panthers vs houston gamblers12 pm et on nbcpeacockhouston gamblers whats the game plan for new panthers head coach mike nolannew gamblers head coach curtis johnson said the season opener is hard to prepare for having never faced new michigan head coach mike nolans team that makes it hard to anticipate the new personnel and schemes hell face on game daynolan took over the panthers this year after jeff fisher stepped down as head coach this offseasonits very difficult johnson said the schedule is what it is but they dont know what were doing and we dont know what theyre doing i just think you have to be pretty generic in what you do you dont want to try all the trick stuff just play solid simple footballi think if you can outexecute the other team it will tell you more about your team so execution is paramount in this oneanother concern for johnson will be his team taking care of the football the gamblers gave the ball away 15 times last yearif we dont turn the ball over make mistakes and have a bunch of penalties i think we can maintain and win some games johnson said we have a good enough offensive line that well be able to run the ball and do some things but the main thing is turnovers and penalties that will kill us we cant have thatmichigan panthers who is the longterm answer at qbjosh love returns for the panthers this seasonthe san jose state product threw for 791 yards in the usfl last season while playing for the pittsburgh maulers and the panthers with four touchdowns and four interceptionshowever the panthers also brought in a new signal caller to add competition to the quarterback room in carson strongat 63 and 230 pounds strong is a big guy who can sling it he completed 68 of his passes for 9368 yards with 74 touchdowns and 19 interceptions during his college career at nevada if love struggles perhaps nolan goes to strong early in the gamethe panthers finished 28 last season and averaged 211 points per game so generating some consistency on offense will be importantexpect michigan to also lean on running back reggie corbin to create some balance on offense corbin led michigan in rushing with 519 yards in 2022 while stevie scott ii added 310 yards on the groundsunday pittsburgh maulers vs new orleans breakers630 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports appwhich quarterback makes his markthe maulers endured perhaps the worst luck at quarterback last year and were unable to find a rhythm offensively in part due to the inconsistency they experienced at the games most important positionthis year three new players have had a chance to compete for the starting gig and james morgan has perhaps the best chance to win the job outright morgan won conference usa newcomer of the year at fiu after passing for 2727 yards with 26 tds against seven ints in 2018 he was selected in the fourth round of the 2020 nfl drafton the breakers roster former alabama am quarterback aqeel glass and cfl veteran mcleod bethelthompson each have enough talent to win the job glass a 6foot5 225pounder led the bulldogs to their first hbcu football national title in the spring of 2021  and first swac title since 2006 while bethelthompson has quarterbacked two grey cupwinning teams 2017 2022 and has led the cfl in passing yards 4731 and passing tds 23 as the starter for the toronto argonauts hes thrown for 4000 yards or more in two of his last four seasonshow new usfl coach john defilippo chooses to manage his quarterbacks will be interesting to see especially since bethelthompson and defilippo spent training camp together in 2016 with the philadelphia eagles when defilippo was the teams quarterbacks coachare the defenses still stoutdefensive coordinator jarren horton turned heads last year with his ability to create one of the leagues best defenses now as an assistant head coach and working for his father new maulers head coach ray horton hes added former alabama linebacker reuben foster to a veteran group that includes linebacker kyahva tezino nose tackle boogie roberts and safety tre tarpleytezino recorded 56 tackles two sacks and an int last seasonmeanwhile the new orleans breakers led the league in scoring defense allowing just 148 points per game while recording 10 picks and forcing nine fumblesmany of the players who made those plays return for them in 2023 as does defensive coordinator jon tenuta as i wrote earlier jerod fernandez who notched 48 tackles and two sacks in 2022 and vontae diggs who had 51 tackles and an int each buoyed a defense that should be goodwhich wide receiver unit shows outthe breakers return the best pair of wideouts in the south division in

spending the last six years in the canadian football leaguewe struggled a little bit offensively early and a veteran guy like himself has been there done that so it wasnt hard for him to get refocused and get our guys going in the second half breakers coach john defilippo said thursday i think he was like 18for20 in the second half something ridiculous it was really really good a guy like him thats played a lot of football there was zero panic in his voice and its great to have a guy like thatbethelthompson won a pair of grey cups and had two 4000yard passing seasons with the toronto argonauts including a leaguehigh 4731 yards on the way to a title in 2022 he wanted more time with his family in returning to the united states and is hopeful a solid showing with the breakers can get him

touchdown to running back anthony jones with 113 left after leaping through the air to convert a key third down on the final drivenew orleans opener was a strong one defensively with 15 points allowed

didnt know wed have that good a defense defilippo said i thought we played lightsout defensivelyon saturday in birmingham the breakers 10 will try to continue a solid start against the houston

from kicker matt coghlin in last weeks opening win but he stepped in and handled punts after matt white injured his ankle early in the game earning the leagues special teams player of the week honors  new orleans not only gets its first two games in his home base in birmingham but will play there next week as a road team against the hometown stallions  houstons leading receiver in last weeks opener

tendon and fullback bobby holly was also placed on injured reservememphis making its usfl return last week lost 2723 to the philadelphia stars but made a solid debut getting 182 yards and two touchdowns from former memphis tigers quarterback brady white  his scores were 43 yards to receiver rashard davis and 29 yards to receiver ryan mcdaniel davis was a top receiver with the tampa bay bandits last season catching 22 passes for 369 yards and two touchdowns before the team moved to memphisbirmingham went 91 last season on the way to a usfl title but the showboats and coach todd haley

seahawks and ravens from 201621 he ranks second in the usfl in rushing after getting 63 yards and a touchdown on 14 carries in last weeks opener  could there be a randy moss sighting in birmingham his

defending usfl champs the birmingham stallionsheres a breakdown of sundays matchupnew jersey generals can mike riley get his team to take care of the footballnew jersey did a good job of taking care of the football last season with a leaguelow eight turnovers but rileys generals fumbled twice last week at birmingham and the stallions turned both of those giveaways into touchdownsthe first occurred on new jerseys opening drive when tight end braeden bowman was stripped by birmingham safety nate holley a play later stallions quarterback jmar smith found receiver austin watkins for a 61yard pitch and catch for a scorein the third quarter new jersey backup quarterback dakota prukop coughed up the football with his team trailing 1710 the stallions capitalized when alex mcgough scooted 29 yards for a birmingham touchdownmaking matters worse new jersey finished 1of4 in the red zoneriley needs to figure out how his offense can execute better in situational football for the generals that means being less reckless with the football and doing a better job of executing in situations like third down where new jersey finished just 4of12 for the game last weeki was real pleased in a lot of the things we did both in the running and the passing and lots of parts of the defense riley said afterwards but we gave up big plays and we lost the situation gamepittsburgh maulers can qb james morgan get a sputtering offense rollingthe maulers totaled a leaguelow 156 total yards on offense in pittsburghs seasonopening loss to the breakershorton used both quarterbacks available in morgan and troy williams but the two combined to complete 10 of 27 passes for 72 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptionsthe maulers averaged 27 yards per pass play and finished 1of11 on first down the only touchdown pittsburgh managed was on an 84yard punt return for a score by receiver isiah henniewhile they struggled moving the ball through the air the maulers did manage 84 rushing yards led by duane garys 34 yards on the ground so perhaps horton can look to run the football to help create balance on offensewe want to start fast and we want to be aggressive horton said after the game we dont want to be a slow four corners dean smith offense thats not what were about were going to aggressive because thats what the players are and thats what i amwhile they sputtered on offense the maulers played solid on defense totaling four sacks and holding new orleans to 1of5 in the red zone on offense linebacker reuben foster led the maulers with 12 combined tackles and a forced fumble that led to pittsburghs other touchdownsunday michigan panthers vs philadelphia stars7 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports apptwo of the top quarterbacks in the usfl after the

seasonwe have entered uncharted territory in the modern era of spring pro football in the united statesyear twowhile there have certainly been changes across the board amongst usfl teams during the offseason the great thing about the upcoming second season is that there are established teams with fully formed identitiessomething that didnt exist a year ago when teams were all brand new and being built from scratchfor the most part usfl coaches and players worked together for the very first time in 2022 and tried to gel quickly in a short period its one of the many challenges that upstart leagues and new teams haveas is the case with any pro sports league changes are inevitable from year to year but its no surprise that three of the top four projected usfl teams in 2023 are returning with many of their best players and most importantly their leadership structure from 2022 intactthe usflstallions and usflgenerals are cofavorites to win the usfl title this year odds  foxbet  usfl

greatest success story in 2022 league mvp and dallas cowboys pro bowl player kavontae turpin the oddsmakers are banking on the new jersey generals being a championship contender again in 2023 a big reason for that is 2022 usfl coach of the year mike rileyanyone who has followed nonnfl pro leagues closely over the last several decades wouldnt have been surprised by mike rileys success in 2022 he has a successful history of connecting with players and building solid foundations from the ground upnotwithstanding his experience coaching for nearly five decades with a winning record in college riley also has a winning resume as a head coach in four professional football leagues the usfl wlaf aaf and the cfl where he won two grey cup championshipsyou dont win games without quality players and assistants on your team but theres no doubt that the generals won nine games last year in large part because of mike rileys leadershipthe been there done that head coach did it againhowever the book in 2022 is closed its time to turn the page and start a new chapter in 2023can rileys troops repeat what they did last season and ultimately finish the job hoisting a usfl championship trophy when the smoke settles on the generals 2023 campaignnew jersey generals 2023 usfl previewthe new jersey generals will have a new playing hub in 2023 and they will share tom benson hall of fame stadium

participant the generals will have some home games in 2023 when they are not playing division rival pittsburgh in canton that isits an improvement from last season and a big difference this yearthere are four hubs in usfl 2023 so there will be teams at a more competitive disadvantage than others playing in road game environmentsmemphis and michigan join birmingham as the three usfl teams with a genuine unencumbered homefield advantage with local fans in attendanceit will be interesting to see how many tristate area fans of new jersey travel to root on the generals in ohio inevitably some canton locals will adopt the generals as their usfl teamhall of fame villages historic and beautiful setting will host the north divisional final and usfl championship game in 2023 so the hope for new jersey is that they stay in their new playing hub for the playoffs perhaps thats where being at home will pay its greatest dividendsusfl 2023 new jersey generals schedulejust like a season ago the new jersey generals draw the short straw having to play birmingham in the stallions home opener the 2022 usfl champions and their home crowd should be supercharged for saturday nights coronationthe week one rematch from 2022 will be a great measuring stick for how good the generals will be in 2023 last season new jersey nearly spoiled birminghams debut but ultimately fell short the team rebounded nicely by rattling off nine straight victories so its not the end of the world if the generals lose their opening game however new jersey can silence many doubters by knocking off the champsthe generals have one true home game in the first six weeks of their season in week 4 when they host the new orleans breakers however from week seven to ten new jersey stays in ohio three of their last four games will be against divisional teams how the generals fare down the stretch will determine if they continue playing in canton once the regular season concludes on june 17thusfl 2023 new jersey

thirty years old the average age of the roster is 269the generals could tweak their lineup several times during the 2023 season so theres always a chance for new arrivals and acquisitions during the season after all in pro football attrition is inevitable due to injuriesthere could be tweaks to usfl rosters in the future but for now teams dress 40 players on game days while ten players go on the weekly inactive list coaching staffs will have to strategically decide who to dress on any given weeknew jersey generals 2023 offense overviewtwo crucial questions emerge about the 2023 new jersey generals offense who will fill the giant cleats of league mvp kavontae turpin and who will lead the way at quarterbackquarterbacksdeandre johnson qbkyle lauletta qbdakota prukop qbone of the usfls most exciting players to watch last season when healthy was qb deandre johnson the last chance u star who spent time at three different universities in college was on the verge of breaking out as a major superstar last season before injuries slowed him downjohnson started only four games in 2022 playing in a qb rotation system however he produced over 1000 yards on offense and scored six touchdownsafter playing some in the spring league in 2021 the 27yearold johnson a dynamic openfield runner grew as a passer in 2022 he completed 72 percent of his passes for a 102 passer ratingdespite johnsons breakout potential the generals are hedging their bets at quarterback late last season new jersey claimed quarterback kyle lauletta off waivers the former richmond standout and fourthround pick of the new york giants provides excellent insurance for the generals he is more of a traditional pocket passer than johnson and it would not shock anyone if he plays a significant share of snaps at quarterback thats if newly acquired qb dakota prukop doesnt also come into the equationprukop the firstteam fcs allamerican is back in the states after spending six seasons in canada as a dualthreat quarterback in the cfl prukop who once upon a time nearly rushed for a thousand yards two seasons in a row at montana state could serve as the perfect complement to deandre johnsonthe ancient belief system in football circles is that if you play multiple quarterbacks you dont have one worthy of starting for parts of 2022 the generals showed that you could defy convention successfully will mike riley and his offensive staff decide to roll with the same rotational system at qb againnew jersey generals wrteswide receiversalonzo moorerandy satterfieldcam echolsluperwarren

could play significant snaps and gobble up more pass attempts than last season and in this offense run blocking is just as essential as passcatchinghowever the offseason additions of demornay piersonel darnell stewart jr and warren newman carry the most intrigue and upside potential in the passing gamepiersonel has the veteran experience to factor in on special teams and as a pass catcher underneath firstteam fcs returner jackson states warren newman and michigan states darnell stewart jr both have a chance to emerge from the packthe generals are returning the same trio they had last season at the tight end position its a group that only caught 25 passes in ten games in 2022 but it doesnt mean the position isnt essential for new jerseyveteran te wes saxton is less of an inline player than braedon bowman and woody brandom thats why the latter two play much more significant roles in the generals dual te sets bowman and brandom are outstanding blockers new jersey not only utilizes their skill sets in the run game and as pass blockers but often to set up big gains in the screen game bowman and brandom were the secret sauce to the generals rushing attack and quick passing game a year agorunning backsdarius victortrey williamskingston daviswhile there are question marks attached to the generals pass game in 2023 there are no doubts about new jerseys ground

williams 579 and victor 577 finished second and third in the usfl in rushing yards if you factor in deandre johnsons running ability 310 yards four touchdowns in 2022 you have an unstoppable trio in the generals backfield that will give opposing defenses serious headacheslurking in the shadows of njs dynamic backfield is kingston davis the 60 225lb threestar recruit from alabama and hbcu standout

seasonjake lacina and evan heim are two of the better interior players in the usfl along with great play at tackle they helped pave the way for the leagues most efficient offense very quietly last season the generals were second in the league in pass yards per game despite being last in the league in pass attempts the team allowed only 16 sacks the fewest in the usfl thanks to excellent

brock miller a favorite of nfl teams on the workout circuit in 2022 miller worked out for over a dozen nfl squads before landing with the los angeles rams the leftfooted specialist finished the year on their practice squad but returns to the usfl for another runit will be challenging to replace you knowwho in the punt return game but its lost on many that although the league mvp went on to become a pro bowl kick returner for the dallas cowboys the player who led the charge for new jersey returning kicks in 2022 was wr cameron echolsluper a year ago he was second in the usfl in kick return yards 748 and second in kick return average with 288however theres still the question of who will be returning punts the leader in the clubhouse could be veteran demornay piersonel after all his prolific history as a punt returner in college 904 yards three touchdowns with nebraska helped lead him to eight different stints with teams on the pro levelpiersonels head coach with the cornhuskers was mike riley if the generals coach decides to deploy demornay strictly at receiver perhaps warren newman the fcs allamerican returner who returned two punts for scores during his collegiate career could get the nodusfl 2023 new jersey generals season predictionall the top teams in the usfl lost standouts from 2022 thats the byproduct of having star players in a league like the usfl these players shine on a grand stage and then doors and more opportunities open elsewhere nfl teams took notice of players like kavontae turpin maurice alexander demarquis gates etcnew stars will emerge with playing time in 2023 the same way those players did and thats inevitable however unpredictable as for whom they willthe generals are in the same boat as good teams like the stars and stallions looking to replace topflight players from last season but even if new jersey wasnt its hard to repeat the same level of regular season success they had in 2022the generals made going 91 look easy a year ago the path to doing so was made more accessible by the bottom teams in the northern division the 19 pittsburgh maulers and 28 michigan panthers both those teams have made significant changes in the offseason to get better and they should be improved by default in 2023therefore i cant see new jersey as dominant as they were in 2022 the generals wont fall to the bottom of the pack but a slide closer to the median could be comingas a bonus prediction although it would send shockwaves throughout the usfl if new jersey were to beat the champion stallions in their home opener i think birmingham favored by five this coming saturday night will debut 2023 in style by beating the generals 2623because of their leadership the generals are still a legit playoff contender and thats what i project for them in 2023 but the best team in the north begrudgingly goes to the philadelphia stars who knocked out new jersey last season and look improved defensively from a year agothe generals

as it comes to their officiating former nfl official and now usfl head of officiating mike pereira sat down for an interview earlier this week with outkick 360 and discussed some of the changes that are coming for the league in 2023 following the addition of another hub city and the lessons learned from their inaugural season there have been several adjustments made to the usfl regulationspereira spoke about how the additional city has forced the usfl to hire more referees for gamesof course it changes now with four hubs so were going to be playing in four different locations so ive had to add officials which is fine the group that we basically have is 80 of it is made up of officials that are on the nfl developmental listthe former nfl official also dove into what changes are to be expected following year onewe looked at the rules and we were pretty pleased with what it was last year we were still a little bit concerned about game times youre going to have the possibility of one game playing into another so we wanted to if we could guarantee that we played them in a threehour window so last year we wound the clock after incomplete passes in the first and third quarters which sped up our game we thought it was a good change but still we think it wasnt quite enough so were going to wind the clock in the second and fourth quarters also after incomplete passes up until the fiveminute mark of the quarter and well see in the first couple of weeks where that makes our time frame fallshortening the game is a goal of many leagues in north american sports and in the usfl it is no differentthey also discussed a change in kickoffs with the goal of increasing the number of kicks returned by each teamwere going to make one slight adjustment to the kickoff 81 of our kickoffs were returned last year kicking off kicking off from the 25 we want to get it to 90 so were going to kick off from the 20 we dont let the kicking team recover the ball if it goes beyond 20 yards the kicking team cant get a head start the defensive receiving team has to put a minimum of nine guys in what we call a setup zone we didnt have too many injuries last year if we did we wouldnt have gone forward with this but we think with these formational adjustments that were good in that area so were excitedfinally pereira discussed how replay will be utilized by the usfl in 2023i am the replay center we will have the replay center in los angeles again so i kind of look at it and think of it from the nfl perspective to this in the nfl im commenting on what others have decided now when it gets into the usfl im making decisions and others will be commenting on what im doing so ill take more flack probably but it was a lot of fun and its the first spring league ive been involved with that has gone longer than one year so im really excited about thatusfl teams across the league are releasing their schedules today and fans are more excited than ever to see their favorite players

predicted and expected the usfl took round one in their opening weekends tv ratings war with the xfl the three overtheair network games gave the usfl a clear edge headtohead with the xfl who aired three cable telecaststhe usfl scored 3162 million viewers for their four broadcasts in week one the xfl had 235 million in their four gamesthe fear going into week one of season two of the usfl was twofold firstly whether the league could match or come close to what they did in last years opening weekend numbers secondly whether the existence of the xfl would splinter what experts believe is a limited audience for this type of producton sunday during the noon timeslot the two leagues combined for 164 million viewers usfl with 974k on nbc the xfl with 670k on espnconsidering these factors the numbers for the usfls tv ratings in week one fared respectably but there was definitely a cap on their viewership due to the splintering of the audiencethe key with year two of the revived usfl is retaining the audience they obtained in year one and then building upon that foundation for longterm growth the league needs to convince casual sports viewers who may have sampled the league out of curiosity a year ago to stick around this time more than last seasonbecause quite frankly theres a lot of doubt and hesitation regarding viewers investing time into these leagues returning for year two could sway some mainstream football fans who were dismissive of the league a year ago that the usfl is here to stay and wont go away as other leagues in this space have over the yearsthats the most crucial test for the usfl in year two is growing for year three and becoming a viable entity that not only survives but potentially thrivesusfl week 2 tv schedulesaturday april 22houston at new

announced its coaching staff and wowthe usfl is quickly being shown to have a competition on its hands they have lost ten coaches in a matter of days to the xfl while also watching new orleans head coach larry fedora stepping away from the league as well we still have a full ncaa and nfl hiring sequence to go through as wellthe big fishthe biggest name on this list is larry fedora the head coach of the new orleans breakers fedora was an outspoken proponent of the expansion to new hubs in the future it seems there was a deeper reason why he wants to coach the team in its market which will not be happening yethow do we know this coach fedora more or less told us himself when he was quoted as sayingi love coaching and i will certainly be open to a usfl return at some point in the future once all teams get settled in their home cities larry fedora coachfedora usflnetwork aka fan media network usflnetwork september 14 2022this essentially tells us all we need to know coaches and players are seeing the value in the setup the xfl offers whether its because of playing in home markets or the fact that the xfl season ends earlier it seems these factors are affecting decisionmaking fedora isnt taking a position with the xfl but his thought process is important to notelarry fedora is only the first of the eight coaches to step away from the league that doesnt mean he is the last before the 2023 season as i mentioned before there is a full season of ncaa and nfl football to be playedtheir black monday is typically right after the season ends there is a chance that we see more usfl coaches hired by the nfl just months before the usfl season starts the big question here is whether or not the usfl starts trying to hire right away knowing that this is on the horizonthe league has said that all of the seven remaining head coaches are staying for the 2023 seasonthree coordinators lostcris dishmannew jersey generals to xfl las vegasthe unfortunate thing about this exodos of coaches is who left in particular it was as if the biggest names ended up moving on knowing that even if the xfl doesnt pan out they will land on their feet the first of these names to be leaked before the move was defensive coordinator cris dishman dishman was a longtime nfl player and his ties to the nfl helped lead to his new positionhe has rejoined a former teammate in rod woodson with the las vegas xfl staff dishman spent thirteen years in the nfl in which he played in two pro bowls and was named allpro twice dishman jumped into coaching in 2004 just four years removed from his retirement from the nfldespite never needing a developmental league to find success he found his start coaching in nfl europe this started a long career of developing players at the spring or college football levels in 2005 he moved on to menlo college by year three he was coordinating a defense for the first time and getting his foot in the nfl door he has since spent 20 years coaching at various levelsincluding stints in the nfl cfl xfl 20 usfl and now the xfl 30 however it wasnt until his 2022 stint in the usfl that he was given another chance to run his defense he went on to coach one of the better units in the league which helped his team to a 92 record overall this season including a ninegame winning streak this performance has in turn earned him a raise and a lateral move to the xfl for the 2023 seasontim lewis defensive coordinatorhouston gamblers to xfl arlingtontim lewis is a longtime coach and coordinator in the professional ranks his first job in the nfl came way back in 1993 when he coached defensive backs for the pittsburgh steelers he spent seven seasons coaching defensive backs before he was promoted into his first coordinator role with pittsburgh he would leave pittsburgh in 2004 making a lateral move to the giantsafter three years with the giants he was let go as coordinator he landed on his feet as a secondary coach a position he held for two nfc west and two nfc south teams over the next eight seasons this streak ended in 2016 when he was out of football for two seasons this came following an illfated oneyear stint under jim tomsula who just signed a contract extension with the elfs rhein firein 2018 he got back into football as a defensive coordinator at pinecrest academy and it was at this point that he began his run in spring football immediately following his year at pinecrest he would accept the head coaching position with the birmingham iron of the alliance of american football after leading his team to 5 wins in just 8 games the league collapsed leaving him to look for a jobluckily for him the xfl was looking for assistants he landed with the jonathan hayesled st louis battlehawks as the defensive backs coach he spent

mcmahon special teamstight ends houston gamblers to xfl houstonthis move is more or less proof that coaches prefer the setup and host cities of the xfl currently mcmahon makes a lateral move to the xfl houston franchise from the usfls houston named team he will work under wade phillips the latest in a long line of amazing coaches he has worked for during his career from sumlin to sean payton and

1990 this was during his time with unlv he was hired to coach tight ends offensive tackles and special teams from there it was like these two roles just stuck for the remainder of his career to this pointhis only break from these positions came from 19921996 when he spent time with the illinois fighting illini as their wide receiver coach this was before moving back to tight endsspecial teams in 1997 staying with illinois for another 8 seasons in illinois leaving in 2004 in 2005 he spent one year in east carolina before receiving the call of a lifetime from sean payton in 2006 when he was

looks solid so far in camp all reports say with his nfl experience he knows what the game should look like but he hasnt seen any real playing time since college well see if morgan can fend off

start this season this doesnt come as a surprise with the decision to carry a fullback as well lynn and seybert were quiet for pittsburgh last season they caught a combined 13 balls for 102 yards and

surrounding this game  the story of breakers quarterback mcleod bethelthompson and his partner chinaka hodgebethelthompson is 34 and the oldest player in the usfl he also has quite a football pedigree with two championships under his belt in the canadian football league hodge is a star in her own right and is the lead writer on an upcoming marvel show on disney called ironheartdespite working on the show hodge is in birmingham through the season to support her partner saying i believe that the world deserves to see his talent and not the other way around i believe that the world deserves a

on fox and the fox sports app at simmons bank liberty stadium in memphisgamblers head coach curtis johnson remains in search of his first victory with his new team while showboats head coach todd haley is working to earn his first win in his teams new city of memphiswe just got to get back to work haley said after his teams 422 humbling road loss to the birmingham stallions in week 2 as i told the coaches weve got to figure out what we need to do in all three phases to give ourselves the best chance to win because obviously that result is not acceptable in any way shape or formwhen you take an ass kicking like that youve got to go take a long shower and move forward because theyre not canceling the season and weve got to figure out a way to put ourselves in a position to win another gamethat said heres one big question for the gamblers and showboats to address heading into this weekends matchuphouston gamblers can the offense take better care of the footballits hard to win games when you have needless penalties and are not careful with the football through two games houston has a leaguehigh seven turnovers and a leagueworst minus6 turnover differentialthe gamblers also have 12 accepted penalties for 106 yards tied for third in the leaguequarterback kenji bajar has been the main culprit for houston with five interceptions and a lost fumble in his first two games houston is averaging a respectable 22 points a game but giving up nearly 34 points a contest defensivelyi thought last week week 1 we ran the ball well but turnovers really killed us johnson said this week we just stubbed our toe when its first and long you get penalties that back you up and its just hard to overcome some of those thingsjohnson said the gamblers have put the loss behind them and are focused on preparing for the showboatsweve just got to get back home and put this one to bed johnson said were going to watch the film and go over some of the mistakes we made after that were going to put together a good game plan i think memphis has a heck of a teammemphis showboats defense must show improvementhaley should have no problem getting his teams attention after losing by 40 points on the road to the defending usfl champs from birminghamhowever for memphis to turn things around the showboats need to get more consistent production from the defense the showboats are giving up a leaguehigh 345 points per contest and allowing a usflhigh 239 passing yards a gamememphis is tied for the league lead with eight sacks however the showboats have not forced a turnover in two gamesi think weve got to look inward haley said about his team how we respond to this type of adversity will tell us a lot about the men in that locker room how we react and respond is going to be a critical thing for us its less about opponents and more about what we need to do to play better by eric williamssunday pittsburgh maulers 02 vs philadelphia stars 1112 pm et on nbcthe pittsburgh maulers are

international and backup troy williams from utah have combined to complete just 29 of 57 passes 501 with zero touchdowns and one interception no other team in the league averages fewer than 150 passing yards per game the stars land at the other end of the spectrum due in large part to steady quarterback play from 27yearold case cookus a former cult favorite during his brief run with the minnesota vikings in 2021 cookus has additional nfl experience with the new york giants denver broncos las vegas raiders and los angeles rams though hes never appeared in a regular season game this

analysischances are that some may already be tired of the two spring pro football leagues being compared to one another in viewership dont worry it will all be over soon the usfl and xfl will only share this space for two more weekendshowever the elephant in the room cant be ignoredthe nfl offseason has never seen anything like this two nonnfl pro football leagues in the united states airing games simultaneously both leagues have similarities and share some playing rules but each has a different feel from one anotherits challenging to compare the two in the ratings battle accurately on a couple of different fronts on one side the usfl is in the early stages of its season getting its footing while the xfl is reaching its climax on the other hand each league has different coverage packages over the air network versus cablethe xfl won round two of this ratings battle by default they topped the usfl headtohead directly in cable versus cable matchups 636k versus 133k on saturday afternoon espn vs the usa network and 378k on espn 2 sunday night vs 211k on fs1 however it was hardly a knockout in round two more like one league winning by decisionin week two of this spring league showdown we got an accurate sampling of the potential divide with both leagues going headtohead in cable broadcasts saturday afternoon and sunday nightbased on the returns from the first two weekends of this showdown its clear that there has been a significant level of cannibalization for both sides especially when the two leagues air in opposition to each other the usfl and xfl are both competing for a similar audience diehard football fans who are openminded about a nonnfl leaguethis coming weekend drawing interest from the football fan crowd will certainly be challenging with the nfl draft sure to occupy plenty of attention from thursday through saturdaysetting aside the other league saturday nights usfl game on fox which did air unopposed did see a slight drop from last weeks 864k season debut on fox competition from the nhl and the blowout nature of the game certainly were contributing factorsit hasnt been perfect after two weeks and there is undoubtedly a noticeable gap from some teams in the usfl where the bottom end has been very poor but overall the leagues play has been solid the lack of energy at games due to low attendance turnout is a recurring theme from 2022 that has hindered the usfl product for some especially from a viewership standpoint and a genuine pro sports league feelperhaps this coming weekends michigan panthers game in their home opener at ford field will help add some of the sizzle that has been missing from the usfl steak so farusfl week 3 tv schedulesaturday april 29new orleans at birmingham birmingham 1230 pm usamemphis at houston

johnsonjohnson is taking over the gamblers for the 2023 usfl season after kevin sumlin resigned the gamblers went 37 last year so johnson will be tasked with helping to turn them aroundjohnson has a rich history as a receivers coach holding the role at highend jobs like miami fla from 1996 to 2005 and with the saints from 2006 to 2011 he served as tulanes coach from 2012 to 2015 and posted a 1533 record overall with one winning season after that he returned to the nfl as a position coach and ultimately spent more time with sean payton and the saints from 2017 to 2021the job with the gamblers will be johnsons first highend coaching job since 2021 but the usfl believes he will be ready for it president daryl johnston called him a rockstar and said that the gamblers culture under him is really really different than what they had in 2022hes just such a quality guy johnston told sporting news in an interview i think theyre gonna surprise some people this yearformer florida running backmark thompson will be the top offensive talent with which johnson gets to work on the other side of the ball the reigning usfl defensive player of the year chris odom is now with the cleveland browns so johnson will have to see if they can find a replacement for his skillsetmemphis showboatshead coach todd haleythe showboats are technically a new team but in reality they just shifted the bandits coaching staff and roster over to memphis as such todd haley will return to the usfl in the hopes of improving upon the 46 record he led his team to in 2022haley came to the usfl with three years of nfl head coaching experience under his belt and more than two decades worth of nfl experience while his 2332 coaching record is merely decent he is considered a sharp offensive mind thats why he has been an nfl offensive coordinator three timesunfortunately haley wont get to work with jordan taamu at quarterback in 2023 as he is now playing for the xfls dc defenders however the showboats have added former seahawks running back alex collins to the roster and have an intriguing quarterback room featuring memphis product brady white defensive tackles john atkins and daylon mack also have nfl experience and should help the showboats be strong against the run this seasonmichigan panthershead coach mike nolanjeff fisher was one of the faces of the usfl reboot but he will not be returning in 2023 after resigning during the offseason that said the panthers have a wellknown replacement taking over for him in veteran nfl coach mike nolannolan 64 has been coaching since 1981 and had a threeandahalfyear stint as the head coach of the 49ers he went 1837 during that time he has been a defensive coordinator for a whopping eight nfl teams and should bring a gritty defensive mindset to the pantherstop runner reggie corbin is returning to the panthers and should be a solid complement to the teams quarterback be it usfl veteran josh love or the newly signed carson strong wide receivers trey quinn and whop philyor will be names familiar to football fans from their times with the commanders and at indiana respectivelymichigan also has linebacker frank ginda who starred for the team last year and paddy fisher who was a fouryear playmaker at northwestern former seahawks thirdround pick delano hill at safety and star kicker cole murphy will help to give this team plenty of upside under nolannew jersey generalshead coach mike rileyriley was the usfls coach of the year in its inaugural season after leading the generals to a 91 record now he will return to the team and look to earn his first usfl postseason victoryriley 69 has been a head coach in five different leagues the cfl nfl ncaa aaf and usfl he won two grey cups coaching in the cfl and had a winning record as a college coach 11299with most of his success coming during his time at oregon state in his threeyear stint with the chargers from 1999 to 2001 riley posted a record of just 1434the generals are returning some of the talent that helped them go 91 during the regular season in 2023 that includes the usfls reigning offensive player of the yeardarius victor and quarterback deandre johnson the team will have to work hard to replace reigning mvp kavontae turpin as well as starting quarterback luis perez but at least they will return star safetyshalom luani to the foldnew orleans breakershead coach john defilippodefilippo is replacing larry fedora as the head coach of the breakers after fedora resigned from his post during the offseason getting the respected quarterbacks coach and threetime nfl offensive coordinator was a boon for the usfl as johnston describeddefilippo in 2017 was one of the hottest names in the nfl as a prospective head coach he told sporting news for him to come to the usfl and bring his knowledge the quarterback position to the offensive side of the football is a great opportunity for every player on the new orleans breakersdefilippo has never been a head coach at any level so this jump could test the 44yearold even still he has 22 years of coaching experience and had been in the nfl since 2005 before jumping to the usflthat said defilippo will have to remake a breakers offense that is replacing its quarterback room from 2022 with former cfl quarterback mcleod bethelthompson being the veteran of the group the return of star receiverjonathan adams will help him acclimate to the league while the star linebacker duo ofjerod fernandez and vontae diggs will create a solid core on defense once againphiladelphia starshead coach bart andrusthe stars came up just short in their quest for a title last year but bart andrus is back and ready to coach them to victory this season the 65yearold has coached all over the world in the nfl nfl europe the cfl the spring league and many more he has typically found success much as he did with the stars last seasonphiladelphia could be poised to be one of the usfls best teams as starting quarterback case cookus is returning to the team after a brief stint in the nfl cookus was arguably the best passer in the usfl last season despite starting the year as the backup to bryan scott and he should get better in year two with former nfl firstround pickcorey coleman joining the roster at receiverother familiar names on the stars include former notre dame and packers running back dexter williams former patriots tight end ryan izzo andchanning stribling who was the usfls interception leader last season philadelphia could be the best team in the north and the stars will have a chance to contend for another title especially if cookus can remain healthypittsburgh maulershead coach ray hortonhorton is taking over the maulers who finished with a leagueworst 19 record last season from kirby wilson he will have his work cut out for him in doing so but his decade of playing experience with the bengals and cowboys should give him a chance to succeed in the rolehorton 62 has 23 years of coaching experience including six years as a defensive coordinator with the cardinals browns and titans he has won three super bowls one as a player and two as the defensive backs coach for the steelershorton doesnt have any head coaching experience and since 2017 he has only spent one season coaching that was in the nfl in 2019 as washingtons defensive backs coach so coming back to the field may be an adjustment but the maulers will have nowhere to go but up under his watchthe maulers have attempted to remake their roster during the offseason but top receiver bailey gaither is returning in 2023 elsewhere former jets fourthround pick james morgan will join the quarterback room and could emerge as the starter defense still figures to be pittsburghs strength and it will be interesting to see how former 49ers firstround pick reuben foster fares as he attempts to return from a devastating knee injury that left him with nerve damage and drop footusfl 2023 scheduleonce

between usfl and nflthe usfls first season saw the league experiment with some rule changes to create excitement and intrigue around the new league the leagues goal was to put an emphasis on offense and create extra scoring opportunities and chances for dramatic playsbelow is a rundown of some of the key rule differences between the usfl and nfl that you will notice during the usfls first weekend of action in 20233point conversion opportunitythe usfl will allow teams to attempt a 3point conversion from their 10yard line if they desire teams will also have the option of attempting a traditional extra point from the 15yard line or a 2point conversion from the 2yard lineonce a team decides which conversion it wants to attempt it cannot change its mind unless it calls a timeout additionally if a team attempts a 3point conversion and it is returned for a score by the other team it is worth only two pointsextra points in the usfl you can go for 1 2 or 3 points after scoring a touchdown  pictwittercomvtcmxsmx9h usfl usfl march 23 2022game timing differencesthe usfl will utilize a 35second play clock and a 25second clock after administrative stoppages the nfl currently uses a 40second play clock so this change should hypothetically create more playsadditionally the usfl is planning to stop the clock after first downs during the final two minutes of the second and fourth quarters this will allow teams to save time on twominute drills and create a better twominute drill scenariofinally the league is also planning to keep the game clock running even after incomplete passes save for the final five minutes of each half why they want to keep the running time of the games to three hours or less per the usfls head of officiating mike pereiraalternate onside kick attempt ruleusfl teams will be able to try onside kicks if they desire but there is another alternative to them teams can also choose to run a fourthand12 play from their own 33yard line  eight yards ahead of where an onside kick would be attemptedif the team converts on the fourthand12 they keep the ball if not the defense gets the ball at the deadball spota lot of risk but a lot of reward in the usfl you have another option on top of the onside kick a 4th  12 scrimmage play from the 33yard line  pictwittercomzgprwoslhd usfl usfl march 23 2022how kickoffs will work in the usflthe usfl has designed its kickoffs to generate returns but also avoid excessive forcible contact as a part of themso how do they workthe kicking team will kick off from their own 20yard line all of the kicking teams personnel must be lined up no farther than 1yard back from the 20 to avoid creating a running startmeanwhile the receiving team must have nine of its blockers in the setup zone which is located between the kicking teams 35 and 45yard lines the purpose of these formations is to create fewer opportunities for highspeed collisions on special teamsa new twist to the kickoff is that once a ball travels 20 yards the receiving team must be first to touch it if no member of the receiving team touches it or a member of the kicking team touches it it is a dead ballduring the 2022 season the usfl had its kickers kick off from the 25yard line however they wanted to make sure more than 90 percent of the kickoffs were returned so that necessitated moving the kicker back an extra five yards to make touchbacks that much more difficultpunting rule changeson punts gunners arent allowed to line up outside the numbers and the receiving team cant doubleteam those players until the ball is kickedhow overtime works in the usfl  ot shootoutthe usfl is taking inspiration from both college football and the nhl by instituting a shootout for overtime games what will that entail if the game is tied after regulation the teams alternate twopoint conversion attempts from the 2yard line in a bestofthree series if no victor is decided within three attempts we go to sudden deathrules are here first up an overtime like youve never seen before  pictwittercom6agrsualgt usfl usfl march 23 2022this system was successful in 2022 and created some drama without extending the time of the game as such it is expected to remain in place in 2023replay review differenceseach coach will get one challenge to use during the game however the replay crew will be able to overrule incorrect personal foul calls and have the power to determine if pass interference is intentional 15 or more yards beyond the line of scrimmagemike pereira will be in charge of the replay review system and will communicate with the broadcast about what calls are and are not being madeintentional vs unintentional pass interferencewhy does determining intentional pass interference matter so much well in the usfl pass interference is being officiated differently than it is in the nflin cases of defensive pass interference where a player is intentionally tackled beyond 15 yards it is a spot foul for any other defensive pass interference infraction over 15 yards it will be only a 15yard penalty additionally pass interference calls within 15 yards of the line of scrimmage will be assessed as spot foulsmeanwhile on passes that dont cross the line of scrimmage there are no offensive pass interference penalties nor are there ineligible man downfield penalties so if teams are throwing behind the line of scrimmage blockers will be free to move downfield to set up opportunities to run after the catchheres how pass interference rules will differ in the usfl this season  pictwittercomm6p26vbzvv usfl usfl march 23 2022usfls two forward passes rulethis is a rule that the usfl originally took from the xfl in 2020 teams are allowed to throw the ball forward twice so long as the first pass is completed behind the line of scrimmage and the second is thrown from behind the line of scrimmagethis may create some strangelooking plays but it will keep both defenses and fans alike on their toessensors in the usfl ballthe usfl is looking to accurately measure each first down how are they doing that they have sensors in the ball that will help officials decide whether the offensive team made the line to gain its similar to the system used to determine whether a ball is in or out in tennisfirst down measurements that are more accurate than ever take a look at the first down technology that will be featured this season

2023quick look back and forward after the new jersey generals week one lossfor the first time since mike riley took the reigns as new jersey generals head coach there is doubt about the teams prospects moving forward the generals lost key some players in the offseason and their week one performance didnt help silence new jerseys nonbelieversin their defense the generals had their chances against the stallions in birmingham  the best team in the league new jersey produced 361 yards on offense rushing for 197 yards led by 2022 offensive player of the year darius victor 889 however nj was undone by failing to convert first downs 413 on third downs turning the ball over twice and subpar red zone execution only one score in four tripsthe most alarming aspect of week ones performance was not the obvious absence of key players from last season but the poor performance of their most important returning star player qb deandre johnson the 2022 league standout had his typical showing on the ground with 45 yards rushing however his 413 passing effort for only 29 yards was awful its not the kind of effort you expect from one of your top playersthe generals were bailed out by new arrival quarterback dakota prukop 1317 148 yards one rushing touchdown mike rileys two qb system will remain intact moving forward as a result of week one but if johnson doesnt play better than he did in week one kyle laulettas inclusion in the offense wont be far behindnew jersey also had some other tough breaks in week one they lost veteran wrkr demornay piersonel to a right knee injury the

team for everyone in the usfl the generals outscored them in their two meetings last season 5031 the generals rushed for 272 yards and four scores in those matchupsbut a year later thanks to the hiring of longtime nfl defensive coach ray horton and the signing of alabama standout and former nfl firstround draft pick reuben foster who is coming off a fantastic usfl debut with 12 tackles and a forced fumble that led to a defensive touchdown pittsburgh doesnt look like a pushover anymore on defensehowever the offensive side of the ball for the maulers was very reminiscent of their 2022 counterpartin week one pittsburghs qb tandem of james morgan and troy williams completed just 1027 for 81 yards last week in their loss to new orleans the maulers generated a putrid total of 156 yards

5 2023the stars are coming off backtoback tough losses giving up another 3 sacks on case cookus and averaging just 1 yard per carry on 18 attempts in the run game falling to 12 the stars are for all intents and purposes currently in fourth place in the north division with the 12 maulers having just defeated the stars they hold the tie breaker as of now that is the bad newsthe good news is that the stars arent standing pat entirely in the past week philadelphia has signed defensive lineman keyshon camp who spent time with thestallions last season and former san antonio brahmas linebacker joel dublanko chris rowland returned to the lineup and adam rodriguez played like the future defensive player of the yearlets break down the badthe maulers front seven played like you would expect a ray and jarren hortoncoached team would play and came downhill stuffing the run game of the stars every time they attempted to run the ball the offense has seemingly lacked some creativity and hasnt caught defenses off guard often through three gamesbefore this week our run game had been bad but the maulers took this to a new level eighteen carries for eighteen yards on the day the maulers managed 5 tackles for a loss 3 sacks and 1 forced fumble reuben foster played like he belongs in the nfl collecting 11 tackles 2 for a loss 1 interception and 2 deflected passes he and kyahva tezino have combined to form quite the devastating duo at linebackerr but this might have been their best performance this seasonplay callingour offensive play calling has seemingly grown stagnant and predictable times allowing defenses to read and react more quickly than any offense can handle talentwise bart andrus has years of experience calling plays its time to dig into that playbook and really start attacking opposing teams while they do take deep shots from what i have seen they should consider working in more double moves and option routes for these savvy veteran receiversthe way this team is built we have a solid mixture of players with top level speed but also plenty of players that can be physically imposing as well the reality is this offense will never be successful no matter what plays are called if they cant do a better job up front three weeks averaging 28 yards per carry with just over 50 yards per game maybe its time to take a page from birminghams bookprotection woesthree weeks and 12 sacks allowed even if half of that can be attributed to great coverage and cookus holding on to the ball the offensive line is still averaging 2 sacks allowed per game and thats being generous i underestimated how big the losses of gunnar vogel and alex akingbulu were to this team both of those men were trustworthy anchors who andrus had specifically built his offensive line aroundlosing blake camper and several others to injury has only further complicated things for the stars the talent is there but these players are either banged up or some are playing out of position to fill a need the stars went very offensive lineheavy in the draft and a few players havent been signed by the nfl yet and one was selected by the cfl in their global draft perhaps its time the stars bring in some of their rookieswith at least four available including two defensive players the stars could bring in all four and potentially rebuild their depth something they have lacked since week onelets look at the positive pointsheading into last weekends game we got word that chris rowland would be returning to the lineup it can not be overstated how important to this team that rowland is at this point playing as the stars rb3 as well as their wr3 and their primary kick returner rowland managed to light up the field against memphis in week one before leaving the game early due to injury getting rowland back brought back some of the explosiveness they had been lacking in week two his average for the day was nearly a full four yards over the average for the teamadam rodriguez played like a future dpoythe pass rush for the stars was phenomenal this weekend and everyone got involved with both ali fayad and carson taylor adding to their sack totals if there was one player that stood out in this game for the stars it has to be adam rodriguez he would collect team highs on the day in tackles 8 sacks 2 tackles for a loss 2 tied for lead in pass deflections 1 and managed the only forced fumble on the day unfortunately for adam a player on the opposite side of the field in this game would earn the defensive player of the week award reuben foster played like a man possessed this weekend and its impossible to argue he didnt deserve the award however i believe they should have named codefensive players of the week to slight rodriguez after his performance just seems wrong adam took over the game for philly on defenseso far through just three games adam has 14 tackles 2 sacks 2 tackles for a loss 1 pass deflection and 1 forced fumble week three was by far his best week statistically but i expect more games like this especially against the less talented offensive lines around the league he is a premier pass rusher in this league and its surprising in my opinion that it took until week three for him to log his first sack however if last season was any indication a slow start wont prevent adam from a strong finishwe need another performance like this from the defensive line against houston this weekend kenji bahar is one of the most athletic quarterbacks in the league and i have been impressed by his performance so far this season if he can clean up some interceptions he might be well on his way to being a top echelon spring football quarterback lets hope the stars defense makes sure he doesnt cut down on his turnover rate until next weekkicking game quickly gets back on tracki had spoken about it after week one luis aguilar didnt look like himself his only field goal attempt was blocked by the showboats and he would go on to miss an extra point as well leaving four points off the board and hanging three on it not the best performance from a man who has been nearly automatic since the stars signed him to take over kicking duties after his performance last season 8 of 10 on field goal attempts and 19 of 19 on extra points we had come to expect very few miscues from our kicking game last seasonso far this season aguilar is sitting 3 of 5 on field goals and 5 of 6 on extra points after a tough performance in week one he followed it up with another missed field goal in week two suddenly it was looking like our kicking game isnt as clutch as we thought it might be in the 2023 season however he immediately put those thoughts to sleep in week three in week three aguilar was perfect on the day converting both his field goal attempts and his only extra point attempt aguilar actually outscored the offense on the day producing 7 points to the 6 produced on offense lets hope he can continue to stack performances like this the stars are a much better team when luis automatic aguilar is on his game and currently he is a big portion of their scoring ability so the team needs him now more than ever beforecorey coleman looking like a former nfl first round pickcorey coleman has played like the former nfl player he is currently he stands fourth in receiving yards for the usfl with 211 yards he also leads the league in targets with 28 through three games and at times cookus has forced the ball into corey coleman this has led to a 679 catch rate which unfortunately leaves a lot of the credit on the wideout if only pffcom would also provided us with advanced statistics on the usfl because i am certain that percentage would jump up quite a bit if you removed the uncatchable passes or off target throwscoleman has been the focal point of the offensive passing attack a trend we all expect to continue my concern with this isnt that the offense runs through him but that it seems when he isnt moving the ball we havent really targeted jordan suell like we did last season there has to be an option next to coleman that can command attention like coleman does in order to free up the entire field as talented as this offense is even with the line holding it back from greatness points shouldnt be this hard to come bypoint spread and betting oddsthis game will be played on fox at 100 pm et time per foxsportscom our betting odds for this weeks houston and philadelphia game arecurrently vegas still believes that philadelphia is the favorite to win the game with blake camper returning to the lineup this weekend the league has them rated as 25 point favorites against houston with the stars 154 to win and the gamblers 120 to win the overunder is 465 points on the gameif youre looking to make some money the under might be the safe bet in this game the stars and gamblers have not combined to score 465 points at any point this season so far although houston has scored over 30 points in backtoback weeks and managed to crush the over in both games best of luck this weekendinjury report and active listgame status reports joshua moon out l hamstringdl cedrick lattimore out r achillesdl chris nelson full go

in a loss of 40 pounds and ended his tenure in new england before it ever began he jumped around the nfl cfl and xfl for the next five seasons garcia has spent time with the patriots jets colts dolphins roughriders elks vipers and defenders now he joins the stars to help add depth to this line but wasnt immediately activated giving him time to learn the playbooklabray ray dl alabamaray is yet another former patriots player but he played there in 2022 ray spent the entire 2022 season with the patriots signed before training camp he didnt make the active roster out of camp instead he landed on the practice squad which allowed him to continue his development and earn an opportunity to return the following season he would sign a futures deal with new england after the season but end up released in february this is a solid addition of a young player who could be a big time performer in the long run for the stars he is active and available this weekendright the ship or sink to the bottomthe stars are looking like a team that is reeling and struggling to find solutions until week three the stars had only brought in one player in an effort to fix some of these issues for their team now over the last week alone we have seen three players added with a linebacker defensive lineman and offensive lineman all added to help improve our run game and run defense they say defense

good team like the stallions 21 points could very well be not enough to win if the maulers play the best defense they can their opponent is averaging 33 points a matchup they could be a team that you can only contain and not stop so its time for troy williams bailey gaither and others to build off the late momentum they had last weekend and take this unit to a level that can compete with the best

every matchup so far this year the defense and special teams are there so its the offenses turn to up their productionmaulersstallions previewi think this maulers team still has plenty of room to grow they showed us some things to be optimistic about last week with the continuation of their great defensive play their special teams unit came in clutch putting up points every time they were called out for a field goaland the offense three weeks into the season found the end zone for the first time but this stallions team is great quarterback alex mcgough has 607 passing yards and seven touchdowns on the season their pass rush has been ferocious out the gate the maulers will have their hands full in this matchupim not confident in their ability to steal a win but i am confident that

performance as they went into detroit michigan and blew the roof off ford field with a 4116 shellacking of the philadelphia stars the gamblers racked up 463 total yards of offense and the defense sacked philadelphia quarterback case cookus six times in the win houston did get tough news though with quarterback kenji bahar suffering an ankle injury in the win and missing most of the second half of the gamethe win put houston at 22 and currently riding a twogame winning streak in the process they have a massive challenge facing off against the 31 birmingham stallions who are also coming off a

he will be out for the game against the stallions the other big name moved to the inactive list is kristjan sokoli who has played a big part on the defensive line in the middlethe good news for houston though is pledger was active again which should put him as the number two back on the team quarterback montell cozart was also moved as activated as he should be in line to be the backup to terry wilson houstons college draft pick jeffrey johnson was moved to the active list for the first time this season as he could see playing time with sokoli outgamblers depth charteveryones eyes shift to the quarterback position as it will be wilson getting his first career start in the usfl with cozart being his backup for the game an interesting note to make is isaiah zuber is listed as a wide receiver and a cornerback whether that is a mistake or not is unknown but it is worth noting that houston only has four cornerbacks so zuber could be an emergency cornerback if neededgamblersstallions previewphoto via twitter usflgamblerswilson has big shoes to fill with bahar being out as bahar has improved his performance every single week this season houston offensive coordinator eric price has used wilson more for running situations so fans could see a shift with the running game being a bigger factor the good news is the receiving core is deep with justin hall being the star of the group which should give wilson more confidence to generate big plays on offensethe defense for houston is starting to come into form with ronheen bingham and reggie walker becoming top pass rushers in the usfl donald rutledge jr has emerged as a top player in their secondary with him and manny bunch being a good onetwo punch at the safety positions itll be worth noting

williams also out for the team if there was ever an opening for houston to take the division by the horns and run with it winning this game would help with that the stallions are still deep on the roster but houston has proven to be competitive in their games gamblers head coach curtis johnson has done a spectacular job leading the team to early success another win would have houston in the

starting with a contest in birmingham between a pair of 42 teams  the birmingham stallions and the new orleans breakers  each looking to gain an edge in the south division that will be followed by a

eric d williams and greg aumanbirmingham stallions 42 vs new orleans breakers 42saturday 4 pm et on fox and the fox sports appa month ago the new orleans breakers and birmingham stallions were playing for supremacy not just in the south division but for the best record in the united states football leaguebut with four games left to play this season the stallions and breakers might simply be playing for a place in the playoffs thats how tight the race is in the southbirmingham 42 new orleans 42 and the houston gamblers 42 are each tied for first place in their division with the memphis showboats 33 just a game back however its the breakers who look most vulnerable heading into their week 7 showdown against the stallions on saturdayafter opening the season 40 john defilippos breakers have lost their last two games those losses were away from their home hub in birmingham though and they were two of the worst games theyve seen from quarterback mcleod bethelthompson through six weeksin fact the losses on the breakers record each coincide with the only instances where bethelthompson has failed to pass for at least 250 yardson top of that tailback wes hills who had backtoback 100yard rushing performances in weeks 2 and 3 has failed to rush for 100 yards in each of the breakers last three gamesgetting back home might be just what the breakers are looking for to regain their formthats one reason to believe the breakers can pull off the double and beat skip holtzs stallions for the second time this season but dont expect it to be easy the stallions boast last weeks usfl offensive player of the week in quarterback alex mcgough who accounted for 133 pass yards and 82 rush yards in their win against michigan in detroit last weekwith each passing week mcgough has grown more confident and holtz has complimented how hes grown into the role of starting quarterback even asking for mcgoughs input on playcalling during gamesmcgough continues to get help from a receiving corps that is blossoming with tight end jace sternberger and wideouts davion davis and adrian hardy becoming steady and dependable passcatching threats just in time for the running game to kick into gearlast week running back cj marable became the first stallion to rush for 100 yards in a game this season meaning the teams leading rusher mcgough has help toting the rock in shortyardage situationsthe stallions ability to run the ball against michigan last week was aided by the defense returning to form with complementary football after giving up at least 20 points three weeks in a row the stallions clamped down on the panthers surrendering just 13 pointsin their first loss of the season the stallions gave up a gaudy 45 points to the breakers and allowed 483 yards of offense

fs1 and the fox sports appat 33 the philadelphia stars are tops in the usfl north division with four games left however the rest of the division remains in striking distance at 24 including the team the stars face saturday at tom benson hall of fame stadium the pittsburgh maulersmaulers head coach ray horton already surpassed his teams win total from last season and is now working to do something pittsburgh did not accomplish in 2022  make the playoffspittsburgh defeated the stars 2113 in week 3 pittsburghs first win of the season heres one thing to watch for from each team in the rematchstars can the philadelphia offense score tds in the red zonethe stars have won two in a row but have not scored an offensive touchdown over the last two gamesphiladelphia is 0for7 in the red zone over that time frame while kicker luis aguilar has been impressive making 11 of 12 field goals over the last two games the stars cant keep relying on the kicker to finish drivesphiladelphia needs to figure out how to consistently put the ball in the painted area for touchdownsit comes down to mental mistakes and it includes myself philadelphia quarterback case cookus said after sundays win over new orleans i cant make mistakes or turn the ball over like a couple times we did today but i think it comes down to the little things we have a lot of returning guys and sometimes you have to remind them hey if you have a hitch just run a hitch dont worry about the other stuffthe stars lead the league with 45 accepted penalties for 367 yards philadelphia is also tied for second in the usfl with 10 giveaways and had three touchdowns called back because of penalties last weekso curbing selfinflicted mistakes will be key for the stars against pittsburghmaulers can maulers create consistency on offense with run gamehorton would like pittsburghs offense to be dynamic and explosive running up the scoreboard but with the way the maulers are playing on defense pittsburgh could benefit from a runbased ballcontrol offense that plays keep away from the opposing teamwith that in mind the maulers need to find a runner that can keep the chains moving through six games pittsburghs leading rusher has been quarterback troy williams with 214 rushing yards but someone from a stable of running backs that includes madre london duane gary and garrett groshek must take on an expanded role in the offensein pittsburghs wins this season the maulers averaged 1285 rushing yards even though he was pulled in favor of james morgan last week to try to generate a spark on offense williams remains the teams starting quarterback horton saidwe have to be a team horton said are we the most dominant team in the league no defensively do i think we are i do but you have to have the special teams and the offense come along for the ride with youso im very encouraged about the team we are building by eric d williamshouston gamblers 42 vs memphis showboats 33sunday 230 pm et on usathe last time the houston gamblers and memphis showboats faced off neither had won a game as both were off to disappointing 02 starts to their 2023 seasons houston pulled out a close win and since then neither team has lostthe gamblers 42 have now won four in a row and the showboats 33 have bounced back nicely from an 03 start with three straight wins both teams are squarely in playoff contention with four weeks remaining in a strong south division only two teams will make the playoffs and sundays loser will distance themselves from the winner of saturdays game between the 42 new orleans breakers and 42 birmingham stallionsthat week 3 battle between these two teams was one of the usfls best games so far this season  memphis trailed 2310 in the fourth quarter rallying to take the lead on two cole kelley touchdown passes the latter with less than two minutes left houston answered with a 66yard touchdown drive and kenji bahar threw the gamewinning touchdown to justin hall with 13 seconds lefthouston won a game without bahar who was sidelined by an ankle injury and then got him back last week in a 1610 win over the new jersey generals that win was sparked by the gamblers defense which took a shutout into the fourth quarter  houstons leading tackler is linebacker khalan tolson an illinois grad who has 45 tackles through six games and reggie walker and ronheen bingham share the team lead with four sacks eachwhere memphis has its biggest advantage sunday is in turnover margin  the showboats are at a usflbest plus4 for the season while houston is secondworst in the league at minus3 memphis safety troy warner  the younger brother of 49ers linebacker fred warner  has 48 tackles almost twice as many as his closest teammate and the turnovers have come from all over with the showboats 11 takeaways coming from 10 different playersmemphis leading receiver is vinny papale whose father vince played for the eagles in the 1970s and was the main character in the mark wahlberg movie invincible papale has 21 catches for 248 yards and a touchdown the showboats won last week however with defense shutting out the maulers 220 and getting a 109yard touchdown from derrick dillon on a missed field goal memphis has pulled off a 33 record despite enough injuries to their running backs that no showboats player has rushed for 100 yards over the entire seasonhouston doesnt have that problem  running back mark thompson leads the usfl with nine rushing touchdowns and ranks third in the league with 374 rushing yards the gamblers have good offensive balance with hall leading the league with four touchdown receptions on the season one ahead of teammate anthony ratliffwilliams by greg aumanmichigan panthers 24 vs new jersey generals 24sunday 530 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports appall four teams in the usfl north division are within a game of each other with four games remaining which should make for some entertaining contests the rest of the wayand it creates some urgency for this weekends game between the new jersey generals and the michigan panthers at tom benson hall of fame stadiumthis game is a rematch from week 3 when the generals defeated the panthers 2813after starting the season 20 the panthers have lost four in a row while the generals have lost three straightheres one thing to watch for when these two teams match uppanthers why has reggie corbin disappeared from the offenseone of the leading rushers in the usfl last season corbin has had trouble breaking loose over the past monthin week 2 corbin was on the sidelines on tv asking michigans coaching staff to get him the ball more often that led to his best performance of the season a 131yard rushing effort in a 2410 over the philadelphia starssince then corbin has totaled just 132 rushing yards on 39 attempts across four games corbin is still no 6 in the usfl in rushing with 289 yards and he leads the league in allpurpose yards with 820stevie scott iii is second for the panthers in rushing with 245 yards but as a team michigan has managed just 963 yards per game which ranks fifth in the usflbecause of their inability to consistently run the football the panthers have struggled to get much going on offense averaging just 16 points a contest only the pittsburgh maulers are scoring fewer points per game 137 per contestweve got to score more touchdowns obviously instead of getting field goals panthers head coach mike nolan said after his teams latest loss last week a 2713 setback to the birmingham stallions when we get into that red area we want to make sure we get points out of it and we didnt do that all day todaythree of michigans final four games are within the north division so the panthers still control their own destiny when it comes to reaching the postseasongenerals can mike riley find some playmakersnew jersey had the most dynamic player in the usfl last season in league mvp kavontae turpin but through six games riley has struggled to find players to replicate that productionalonzo moore leads the generals with 17 receptions for 224 yards and two scores while fellow receiver cam echolsluper has 14 receptions for 205 yards and two touchdowns tight end braedon bowman has added 11 receptions for 162 yardsdarius victor leads the generals in rushing with 377 yards and two touchdownshowever new jersey has struggled with creating explosive plays and holding onto the football the generals are tied for fifth in the league in scoring averaging just 177 ppg new jersey averaged 232 ppg last seasoneven worse the generals have 10 giveaways this season including a leagueleading eight fumblesto try and jumpstart the offense riley made a change at starting quarterback last week subbing out deandre johnson in favor of kyle laulettalauletta finished 17of30 for 177 yards with a touchdown and an interception but new jersey managed just 10 points in a 1610 loss to the houston gamblersthe bottom line is that rileys generals need more guys to step up and make big plays on offense like turpin did last season whether its johnson or lauletta at quarterbackour goal is to get into the playoffs riley said whatever place that is it doesnt really matter you just want to get into the playoffs but we have to get a win soon to do that by eric d williamsrj young is a national college football writer and analyst for fox sports and

to apples comparisonin 7 weeks the usfl has had 17 network games on foxnbc one has gone over a million viewers the xfl had 4 if the latter had 17 network games in seven weeks their average would have been higher no getting around thatreply4thlongmay 31 2023 at 1042 pmthe thing is the xfl had the benefit of winter while the usfl had the benefit of broadcast time of year is a big factor neither reached their potential also fox as a network is just not in the same league as abcnbccbs its more akin to espn and not enough prime time games so far this yearmy preseason xfl and usfl predictions were both on the high side for both of these reasons posted on xfl board the other reason is its heading into 18 weeks of 4 games of alt fb thats a tougher sellmy big fear going into 2023 was will the presence of both league cause both to fail i do think xfl and usfl need to be talking to coordinate certain aspects or merge at some pointhaving said all that they both are going to be reasonable in the tv ratings department is that enough is another questionkeep up the coverage of both leagues  its good stuffreply4thlongmay 31 2023 at 1100 pmbased on sourcing within the usfl much like the leagues dissatisfaction with their anemic attendance totals in year two usfl ownership has been slightly disappointed with the network numbers thus farthis doesnt surprise me again 2 leagues are taking away from the novelty headtohead games hurt both leagues they moved from tb to memphis  a tv market less than a third in size and less primetime so far and most of all they are not in phillynj or houston and instead are focusing on the smaller tv market cities they may have underestimated these factors however having said all thati was hoping for more too hopefully they give it a couple more years as the ratings are relatively stable from 2023 when u exclude simulcast opener xfl presence in weeks 12 alone account for that and more we shall seereplyrollwavejune 5 2023 at 957 pmid think the league would want to give the teams fans at least a taste of their product once or twice a year the breakers are on year 2 of playing zero home games are they just a mere body bag team ditto stars  gamblers whereas the stallions have played all home games 1 year and half the next whats with canton being a venue is that like having the cowboys play their home games in okc in comparison to

maulerstravel to memphis tennessee to take on theshowboatson saturdaythe maulers are coming off their best showing of the season on the road they took on the michigan panthers and won 237 their offense exploded and their defense dominated for all but one drive of the game pittsburgh truly showed what they were capable of against a solid team in the panthers and they look to build on that momentum against another team thats had their fair share of strugglesthe showboats have had a tough go of it but are currently 23 on a twogame win streak coming off a decisive 1710 victory against the new orleans breakers and a similarly dominant 2910 win over the michigan panthers this should be a key measuring stick game for pittsburgh sitting just below 500 both teams will be looking to take that next step and set themselves up for a big push down the stretchgame previewline maulers 25 ou 415datelocation 1230 pm est simmons bank liberty stadium memphis tennesseeweather forecast 69 degrees cloudy skies humidity 75 wind 11 mphtvstreaming usakey storylines for maulersthe offense put up backtoback weeks of successful production quarterback troy williams put up 299 yards combined on the ground and through the air scoring three touchdowns bailey gaither has stepped up as the true top wide receiver of this squad meanwhile the defense continues its quiet dominance racking up 13 sacks and six interceptions with two defensive touchdownsthey just need to continue playing as a complete team when both sides of the ball are clicking its been proven that they can hang and beat the best of them its just coming into games week in and week out and being that complete unit consistency is what pittsburgh is looking for and maybe some help from some guys not named williams or gaither on offense look for somebody to carve out a huge role for themselves one of these weeks coming up or even this one on saturdaymaulersshowboats previewboth of these teams are riding a high the showboats have won two straight and the maulers have won two out of three something has to give but neither of these two teams looks too apt to give up their hot streak just yeti think that if the maulers can add an additional element to their offense theyll run away with this matchup but if it continues to be troy williams vs the world eventually thats going to catch up to them the showboats themselves have found productive days on both sides of the ball so itll be a tight interesting matchup to the very endi do like what ive seen from pittsburgh in the last few weeks if they dont let up the late big play i think they slam the door on this memphis team in a close grinditout matchup and get to that illustrious 500 mark for the first time in the two year history of this rendition of the

breakout game in week 2 allusfl running back reggie corbin has only totaled 102 rushing yards over the past 3 games while corbin has been effective in increasing his workload in the passing game it is clear a shoulder injury may have impacted his performance overall moving forward into week 6 look for corbin to help carry the load to take some of the pressure of his qb1 who may have another young signal caller breathing down his neck for playing timefinal thoughtsfor the panthers the opportunity to right the ship and change the course of their season is extremely monumental with the stallions coming into town the stallions who are currently 32 have had their fair share of injuries have been forced to lean on alex mcgough through the air and on the ground with the skip holtzs team being without jmar smith and bo scarbrough among other key players while its been an extremely turbulent season for the defending champs dealing with more adversity than they intially planned the stallions through grit and luck remain extremely competitive and in line for a playoff berth at the midway point in the seasonwhile the panthers started off the season hot and fast out of the gate their offense has slowed down tremendously starting with finding consistency at the qb position while i do believe michigan scores a couple more touchdowns this week and puts together a more entertaining product on the field for fans the elusiveness of alex mcgough will prove to be too much for mike nolans team as the stallions win 2617 in week 6 putting the panthers in a win now modesubscribe to our usfl news

guys too i could understand pointing out a strategy to help a team win but win or lose i will say that mike riley is the coach of the generals and should be i am going to again say how the generals were either big play or 3 and out under johnson either way hurts the time of possession battle which the generals destroyed with last year with less than 20 defenders you do not want to be on the field for 60 plays i think he hoped deandre johnson would be the answer he looked good quite a for a bit and does he put defenses on the rack for sure but he did not consistently move the ball i think the tight race has given him an opportunity to change qbs given that kyle laulettas moving the team two weeks ago was what he wanted to see from deandre johnson this isnt the xfl they arent going to gift us alex mcgough for a guy we cut 3 weeks ago i hope this play works out for the generals and lauletta as last week showed he is not a rock as luis perez and deandre johnson is they will always do their best lauletta is kind of like me a person who can get in his own head and cant make a throw from 3rd base kyle you have the game yes you need to get on rhythm with your team earlier this week and the panthers are going to try yo take you out of your rhythm but you got this last week there was a pass you had if you used a little touch and you threw a line and you missed it you had a similar circumstance later in the game put a little arc on it and completed it to help get back in the game believe in your team believe in yourself and you will do fine you have likely thrown 100 passes do your best and you will be fine and put your team first furthermore last season the same guy who is a real good guy by the way i even met him in person he did the same thing last year he said deandre johnson should be the quarterback and didnt understand why riley chose one qb it wasnt the qb he chose for the generals the geenerals were 91 last year and not only did perez lead the league in passing over far bigger names but he also won the xfl championship game this year please just let mike coach he does an awfully good job at itreplyleave a replycancel replyyour email address will not

to restock after significant losses in the offseason properlya slide from 2022 was expected after all they lost their starting quarterback an nfl pro bowl receiverreturner and several key contributors from last seasonnevertheless what has stood out the most and its something that carried over from last seasons demoralizing playoff loss to philadelphia is new jerseys ineffective leadership in close

openonly one team the defending champion birmingham stallions has clinched a playoff berth while the other seven teams remain in play thats right with just one game left for each team none of the leagues eight squads have been eliminated from postseason considerationthat sets up a wild week 10 the action kicks off saturday with two games  a contest in canton ohio between the pittsburgh maulers and the new jersey generals followed by a showdown in memphis between the showboats and the stallionson sunday the new orleans breakers face the houston gamblers in memphis followed by the philadelphia stars vs the michigan panthers in detroitheres a breakdown of this weekends matchups from fox sports john fanta eric williams and carmen vitalipittsburgh maulers 36 vs new jersey generals 36saturday 1 pm et on usaits win or go home on saturday in cantonplayoff football has already arrived in the usfl the north division is filled with drama heading into the final week of the regular season as both matchups serve as elimination gamesthe opener of the weekend comes in canton ohio as the pittsburgh maulers 36 take on the new jersey generals 36 on saturday afternoon saturday 1 pm et on usa the location is fitting because the winner will book a ticket right back to tom benson hall of fame stadium for a postseason matchup the following weekthese two teams are coming off wins in very different ways the maulers lived up to their name and made michigan panthers quarterback josh loves day a nightmare intercepting four of his passes and sacking him four times in a 197 victory special teams delivered in a huge way with a blocked punt as well as one of the plays of the year an 83yard punt from matt mengel highlighting a lowscoring battlethe following night in canton the generals held off a furious comeback effort from the philadelphia stars to win 3733 it snapped a fivegame losing streak for new jersey which had not won since april to set up saturdays critical showdownas much as special teams played a role in the maulers win over the panthers it set the tone and signaled that it could be a different weekend for the generals when cam echolsluper ran the opening kickoff back 85 yards for a touchdown quarterback deandre johnson went 15of20 for 213 yards while the usfls best rushing attack went for 147 yards on the ground highlighted by darius victors 11 carries for 51 yardsthe last meeting sunday april 23 new jersey generals 20 pittsburgh maulers 3the generals earned their first win of the season back in week 2 against the maulers pulling away from a 33 tie at halftime led by linebacker chris orr who tallied a teamhigh 10 tackles and a sack new jersey forced three turnovers and totaled four sacks as the maulers failed to find any offensive rhythm and were stopped twice from scoring by the generals at the 1yard linevictor totaled 15 carries for 71 of the teams 112 rushing yards while notching a touchdown on the ground and dakota prukop threw a touchdown pass to echolsluperthe key question in this gamewill the maulers defense be able to slow down a generals offense that enters the game on a rollsure the best offensive performance of the season by new jersey came against a philadelphia stars team that sits dead last in the league in points allowed at 227 through nine games 252 ppg that being said if the generals offense can keep rolling into saturday pittsburgh could be in for a tough day ray hortons team trails only the new orleans breakers in points allowed 184 ppg while being tied for the league lead in interceptions 11by the same token can pittsburgh find enough offensive playmaking to have the upper hand in this game maulers quarterback and utah product troy williams went 14for24 for 166 yards last week while his numbers arent stunning hes kept control of the football throwing only three interceptions the one issue williams has just five passing touchdowns  nobody other starter has fewer than ninewilliams mobility can be a weapon for the maulers as he sits at seventh in the league with 301 rushing yards along with three rushing touchdowns a receiving core led by isiah hennie and josh simmons will need to step up for an offense that has had trouble finding consistencyon the flip side nebraska product alonzo moore jr figures to be a key weapon in this game sitting at second in the usfl with five receiving touchdowns last week michigan state product darrell stewart jr led the wideouts for the generals totaling a gamehigh 109 yards on just three receptions but at the end of the day if new jersey can get the ground game going and prolong drives they could wear down the maulers that starts and ends with victor who is third in the league with 506 rushing yards and has powered the usfls best rushing attack 1354 yards per gamekey statsthe maulers are 05 when allowing 14 or more points this season while the generals average 201 ppgheres another interesting nugget on the generals whose record might be deceivingwhat does this game meanthe winner of this game makes the playoffs and will then watch sunday nights matchup between the stars and panthers ford field 7 pm et on fox and the fox sports app to see who their opponent will be in the usfl north division championship game saturday june 24 at 8 pm et from canton on nbcif philadelphia beats michigan the stars are division champions if the panthers beat the stars the winner of pittsburghnew jersey will be the division champson saturday throw out the records the fact that the south division went 133 against the north division that doesnt matter now when the maulers and generals square off on saturday its a fight to extend the season for both and a dramatic way to kick off the final weekend of the regular season by john fantabirmingham stallions 72 vs memphis showboats 54saturday 4 pm et on fox and the fox sports appthe birmingham stallions already clinched their spot in the usfl playoffs with a game left but the memphis showboats have an uphill climb to do the same in the final week of the regular season when these two teams meet on saturday at simmons bank liberty stadium 4 pm et on fox and the fox sports appthe stallions lead the south division at 72 overall while host memphis is two games back at 54 birmingham easily handled memphis 422 in week 2the showboats had their fivegame winning streak snapped with a disappointing 313 loss to the new orleans breakers 63 in week 9 while the stallions boat raced the houston gamblers 54 last week 3815the stallions can clinch the south division title with a win or a new orleans loss memphis needs a win along with houston defeating the breakers to finish in a threeway tie for second place and a faint opportunity to go to tiebreakers for the second playoff spotheres one thing to watch for the stallions and the breakers entering this weekends conteststallions will skip holtz rest his star playersthe stallions are already in the playoffs and know that theyll be playing for the south division championship in their home stadium so theres little for birmingham to play for against the showboats this weekendhowever birmingham already has lost impact players due to injuries at different points of the season including quarterback jmar smith running back bo scarbrough receiver marlon williams and linebacker scooby wright so perhaps holtz will rest some key starters to make sure they are ready for the playoffsfor now holtz isnt divulging what he plans to do on saturdaywe can talk about maybe getting some people healthy with where we are at some positions holtz said after his teams victory over houston last week we dont have enough to sit everybody down and bring the b team so to speak but weve got to look at it i dont know how well play it right now but theres one more game ill talk to the leadership council about how they want to handle it and then well make some decisions as a teamif last year is any indication holtz chose to play most of his frontline players in a meaningless week 10 game last year with his team already in control of the top spot of the south division so it seems likely that keeping the momentum and rhythm going and playing at home will be more important for holtz and the stallions than resting players for the first round of the playoffsthe fans have been great holtz said theyve been unbelievable theyve been awesome at home what a treat to know that were going to get one more chance to play in birmingham one more time in the 2023 seasonshowboats can memphis offense hold onto the footballshowboats head coach todd haley probably didnt waste much time watching the film on how his team performed last week which included a weather delay of more than three hoursmemphis turned the ball over five times in a loss to new orleans and didnt get on track offensively and the showboats face an opponent that held them to two points earlier this seasonstill with a slim chance to make the postseason still within reach not to mention playing at home haley expects his team to play much better in the final regularseason gamei dont care about any of that stuff  i really dont haley said when asked about the playoff scenarios we have to play better football we were doing a really good job in the plusminus area the defense was doing a good job of taking away the football but the offense was still careless in a few areas and that reared its headthe bottom line for our team is i love our team i love our guys i want everybody to get healthy obviously but weve got to play a lot better than that to think of anything beyond this regular season by eric d williamsnew orleans breakers 63 vs houston gamblers 54sunday 4 pm et on fs1the playoffclinching scenario for the new orleans breakers is straightforward heading into the final week of the usfls regular season at 63 and standing alone in second place in the south division if new orleans defeats the houston gamblers on sunday the breakers are in the postseasonnew orleans could even claim the no 1 seed with a victory over the gamblers on sunday 4 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports app at simmons bank liberty stadium and if the birmingham stallions also stumble vs the memphis showboatsbut for now the breakers will be content with a w and moving onyeah playoffs are dope new orleans linebacker vontae diggs said but coach john defilippo says it every week  the most important game is the next game it doesnt matter about the playoffs yeah thats in the back of our mind and thats what our goal is but were seeing this as just the next gamewere not worried about it we know what weve got to do but as long as we play new orleans breakers football in all three phases were not worried about clinchingat 54 houston also has a chance at the playoffs with a victory over the breakers and some help from other teamsthat said heres one thing to watch for the breakers and the gamblers heading into the final week of the regular seasonbreakers can mcleod bethelthompson get back on trackwhile he remains the usfls leading passer with 2206 yards new orleans quarterback bethelthompson threw for a seasonlow 88 yards in his teams decisive win over memphis last weekhowever while new orleans struggled to move the ball on offense bethelthompson didnt turn it overdid we execute like we wanted to absolutely not bethelthompson said but when you have a defense like this sometimes you just got to not get in your own way and let them go win the football gamethe 34yearold signalcaller now matches up with a houston defense he had some success against in a week 2 3831 victory in birmingham in that game bethelthompson completed 676 of his passes for 251 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptionsrunning back wes hills also had a big game totaling 110 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 18 carriesthe gamblers have allowed 243 points per game this season only the philadelphia stars allow more 261 ppghouston can the gamblers find the end zonehouston kicker nick vogel had an impressive day at the office last week finishing 5for5 on field goals with a long of 47 yards but playing against perhaps the best offense in the usfl in new orleans much like last week against birmingham the gamblers will need touchdowns instead of field goals to earn the victoryhouston running back mark thompson had trouble getting anything going against stacked boxes last week finishing with just 56 rushing yards on 17 carries the usfls leader in touchdowns with 13 thompson needs houston to create some balance on offense with the passing game to loosen up opposing defensesbut thompson said he will continue to make the most out of his opportunitiesive already put that game behind me thompson said afterward were moving on to next week its a very important matchup it really determines what happens with us the following week so were all focused on new orleans right nowhouston also could look to get justin hall more touches an explosive playmaker after the catch hall managed six catches for 45 yards on nine targets in last weeks losshouston faces a new orleans defense that has allowed an usflhigh 2047 passing yards this season by eric d williamsphiladelphia stars 45 vs michigan panthers 36sunday 7 pm et on fox and the fox sports appthe playoffs start nowweek 10 of the usfl in the north division is essentially the postseason given how wideopen the division is the winners of each of the two north matchups will earn their right to play more football the losers will see their seasons end its as simple as thatthe philadelphia stars with a 45 record hold a narrow lead over the rest of the north as they play visitor to the michigan panthers 36 in detroit sunday 7 pm et on fox and the fox sports app its a primetime winorgohome elimination game with no shortage of dramathe stars need their offense more than everboth teams are coming off losses but the stars got an excellent showing out of their quarterback last week in a 3733 defeat against the new jersey generals case cookus went 25of39 for 322 yards with three touchdowns the stars also have some offensive firepower in their arsenal to complement cookus as well wide receiver corey coleman leads the league in receiving yards with 614 offenseadjacent kicker luis aguilar has the most points of all usfl kickers with 84 last weeks affair against new jersey was yet another highscoring game and the stars have scored 34 or more points in two of their last three conteststheyll be going against one of the leagues best defenses but if they can manage to score theyll retain their lead in the north into the postseasonwe are in control of our own destiny cookus said after last weeks game we can look back on this and were going to learn from it but we have an opportunity to still make the playoffs weve still got an opportunitymichigan will need to return to their earlyseason defensive formthe michigan panthers may be uniquely qualified to stop phillys potent offense though they held the stars to a seasonlow 10 points in the last meeting linebacker frank ginda not only leads the usfl in tackles with 96 but the doitall defender is also tied for the league lead with three interceptions former nfl firstround pick breeland speaks also leads the league in sacks with 90the panthers found success against the stars last goaround with their defense in addition to holding philadelphia to 10 points they also took the ball away four times but the panthers also scored 24 points in that game in last weeks loss to the pittsburgh maulers michigan put up just seven on the scoreboard they scored over 20 points in the prior two games though so it can be donemichigan will want to make the season series against philadelphia a sweep and get their first win at home in front of their fans this year they have three wins on the season but all of them have come elsewhere itd be almost poetic for their first one at

running back toa taua gets his first opportunity to make an impact as the rookie running back will be active for the first time this season per the panthers depth chart offensive coordinator eric marty will be rolling with stevie scott and aj richardson as the teams primary options in the backfield with toa maybe sniffing the field mostly on special teams the panthers also will be bringing up vantrel mcmillan a defensive lineman in favor over ethan westbrooks mcmillan has appeared in seven games this season totaling 7 tackles and 15 sacks as a rotational piece on the defensive linekeys to the gamerelying on the law firmwith the panthers resting reggie corbin due to his shoulder injury michigan may be forced to utilize the services of scott richardson and taua to bare the weight of corbins vacancy this week while scott has been a serviceable and versatile during his usfl career his two understudies have had a limited opportunities in their professional careers aj richardson and toa taua will be asked to step up this week with corbin out with only richardson having any experience in the usfl richardson a wide receiver has started taking snaps at running back and has totaled 39 allpurpose yards 29 receiving 10 rushing while taua is set to make his pro debut this saturdayall eyes on mewith corbin out the spotlight turns to josh love to be the panthers leader during week 9 love has shown vast improvement over the past three games after the team fully invested in him as qb1 after carson strongs injury with love in full control the panthers will continue to ride with the san jose state alum especially with the chemistry hes manufactured with joe walker trey quinn and his tight endskeep ringing the bellone of the larger storylines of the 2023 usfl season was the panthers signing of former ole miss defensive lineman breeland speaks while speaks has made a huge impact in his personal stat line his contribution to players like levi bell and frank ginda may be a overlooked in my opinion bell specifically has been an asset for the panthers carving out a starting role since signing with the team the fcs allamerican has totaled 25 sacks playing opposite of speaks and continues to provide a steady amount of pressure on every passing down often time requiring a te or rb to assist opponents right tackles while speaks continues to dominate the draftingsigning of bell bodes well for the panthers to continue to create havoc with their pass rush especially with a mobile elusive qb like the maulers troy williamspredictionthe maulers do have an outside chance of making the 2023 playoffs and will not be laying down to the panthers in their week 9 matchup even with standout wr bailey gaither sidelined this week the maulers have ish hyman tre walker and isiah hennie in their arsenal to aid the elusive qb troy williams who is the maulers most dominate option in the running game with the maulers defense led by kyahva tezino along with a lean and mean boogie roberts the panthers run game which is missing reggie corbin could be forced to take to the air in an effort to keep their playoffs hopes alivewhile the panthers seem to have the edge on offense despite corbins absence theyll need a big game from their linebacking corps to keep troy williams contained in the rushing attack look for 3x dpotw winner frank ginda to be sideline to sideline constantly as the maulers look to unload all the tricks in an effort to come out on topoverall i think the panthers win this game as the stakes are too high coupled with the fact that michigan is away from ford field and this is the second time they are facing pittsburgh the panthers win this matchup by a score of 2717 due a solid outing from joe walker and trey quinn coupled with

on special teams could determine the outcomein week 9 the generals return game finally came to life thanks to an 85yard kickoff returned for a touchdown by cameron echolsluper it was a necessary spark for a team last in the usfl in kick and punt return average this season a stark contrast from what the generals return game was like in 2022 with nfl pro bowler kavontae turpinone area that was troubling a week ago and that could factor into saturdays game was that new jersey allowed a 41yard punt return to the stars and 32 yards per kick return against dangerous topnotch return specialists like isiah hennie and josh simmons that type of coverage play could prove disastrousyou combine elite play from defense and special teams with a leagueleading plussix turnover ratio and you wonder how ray hortons maulers are only 36its because the maulers are last in the league in total offense last in yards and points scored 148to his credit quarterback troy williams has thrown only three interceptions this season although the numbers havent been flashy through the air he does lead the team in total yards and touchdowns williams is a legit dual threat that has played under controlthe last time the generals and maulers squared off was in week 2 new jersey held pittsburghs offense to three points and 166 total yards ted cottrells defense registered five sacks and forced three turnovers in new jerseys 203 victoryfor new jersey to win in week 10 they must repeat that type of performance because points and yards on the other side of the ball wont come easy against pitts defenseusfl week 10 prediction new jersey generals vs pittsburgh maulersin week 9 mike rileys troops finally flipped the switch against philly and playedcoached their best game of the 2023 season no question that unleashing a healthy deandre johnson helped matters immenselyjohnson and the generals key players will need to play at a high level for new jersey to get back into the playoffs they are facing a dangerous opponent in pittsburgh who if they get any semblance of positive production from their offense can win it all as ludicrous as that sounds when discussing a threewin teamone of these teams will be 46 and stay in canton to play next saturdays north divisional championship gameit will be close but i think the generals make enough plays offensively to march back into the usfl

to the point and the perfect way to state it i have no choice but to defend mike here though he had it as a close game and to be honest i felt that it would be tight i did take the maulers i felt pretty good about them beating the spread who would win or lose was up in the air but he has to make a call i actually feel bad for the generals players because they played hard and the game was tight the problem is that the team realized that when the team realized johnson could ot win the game for them they quit this is likely the 3rd time that i am writing what comes next this is how i felt it happened this year i feel that mike riley was stuck deandre johnson was the incumbent quarterback upper deck made two different football cards of deandre johnson as he was expected to be the starter riley showed conviction last year to have to stick with perez after johnson who had great numbers returnedand he was right not only did perez lead the usfl in passing efficiency made play after play that expanded his skill set and also won the xfl championship game after trying to give the fulltime job to johnson he could see his limitations although johnson can make every throw has a good idea of when to run and when not to run has the heart of a lion he still does a poor job reading defenses he should have packages for him but not necessarily be the starting qb two weeks ago i wrote how happy i was that the lauletta experience was over but i thought we were moving on to prukop the most talented qb on the roster if he did nit work out i felt johnson could step in because that is what johnson does he never causes himself to fail the good news is that when i wrote this i knew lauletta was done although he has an accurate arm  i feel he gets in his own head i think that became clear to riley and likely to lauletta just like i knew he was over with the generals i feel johnson is now over with the generals i feel riley realized earlier in the season that he can run the ball and go deep but he has trouble moving the chains under johnson they consistently lose the top battle and run far fewer plays than their opponents something that has to give i think johnson will be traded for a receiver maybe bailey gaither ryan mcdaniel anthonyratliff williams or tight ends like josh pederson or rb tj pledger i hope dakota prukop eric barriere adrian martinez or another veteran will fight it out to see who can move the chains on a consistent basis i wish johnson well and i hope he is somewhere if he could feel comfortable running some packages i would like him with generals but not to start as the only coverage the league has i ask all the writers across country to be open minded when watching the games and write what you see i know i have been watching football a longer time than most but i am sure i am far from the sharpest crayon in the box and i can see it i feel mark perry does a great job of writing what he sees and uses stats to tell a story he is an amazing ambassador for the league reading him i could be wrong but i feel he never played organized ball which says a lot about how good he is i think a great young talent is james larsen truly a good love for the game really brings out the story lastly mike you are the best one in the country i know i gave you a hard time last week but you connect the dots like no one stay welli look forward to seeing what the generals do next year but i will enjoy the playoffs really hoping for 10 teams next yearreplyleave a replycancel replyyour email address will not be published required fields are marked comment  name

gamblers fight for their playoff lives against the new orleans breakershoustons offense struggled to get into the end zone as they leaned on nick vogel to hit five field goals in the contest while kenji bahar completed 74 percent of his passes he only threw for 149 yards and one interception mark thompson was held out of the end zone for the first time this season running for 56 yards on 17 carries three turnovers by houston also didnt help the team get into the gamethe gamblers defense was a mixed bag of performance as they didnt get a sack on alex mcgough allowing 292 total yards and 38 points mcgough scored three total touchdowns but the defense was able to record three turnovers in the game with two fumbles and one interception this led to a 3815 win for birmingham thanks to 21 points scored by them in the fourth quarter to secure a playoff spotwhat this means for houston is now they sit in third place in the south division with a 54 record and are on the outside for the playoffs for the gamblers to make the playoffs they must beat new orleans and win the tiebreaker over them as well tiebreakers include headtohead record best divisional record strength of victory best

higbys questionable injury statusgamblersbreakers previewphoto via twitter usflgamblersnew orleans has been up and down with their offense in the back half of the season but there is no denying they have plenty of weapons on that side of the ball houstons defense will have their hands full as this is the same unit that scored 38 points on them at the beginning of the season itll be up to the secondary of the gamblers to hold top receiving targets like sage surratt johnnie dixon and jonathan adams running back wes hills is always a threat to run the ball as well as catch out of the backfieldhouston needs a big day from not only thompson on the ground but bahar must throw the ball with efficiency its been repeated that bahar has not been the same since the ankle injury against philadelphia this is his chance to redeem himself with a big game thompson cant be held out of the end zone again as houston leans heavily on him to get them in the end zone especially in goalline situationsfor houston to even be in a position to make the playoffs with what expectations were heading into the season is impressive in itself coach curtis johnson deserves a ton of credit for the job he has done now its about doing what they need to do to finish the job and get into the playoffs new orleans is challenging because of how good the offense is but if houston can find that same

coordinator eric marty made a huge decision to bench josh love and go with the ivyleague stand out ej perry love as we stated earlier has been extremely hot and cold throughout the season however was the panthers most experience quarterback on the roster in week 10 with the playoffs on the line the burden now lies with perry to play a clean game that will be aided by the rushing attack of corbin

on the defensethe panthers defense exploded for 7 sacks in week 9 led by the likes of breeland speaks and levi bell in week 10 mike nolans and steve browns defense will once again be asked to shoulder the load in hope of giving the michigan offense plenty of opportunity to keep the game close and provide them with short fields if possible with philadelphias weakest position group being the

panthers all eyes will be on ej perry this sunday as fans and media of the usfl will be curious to see how the young quarterback performs in his regular season professional debut while the panthers have answered questions about their receiving corps and defense the ability to consistently push the ball down field remains an open conversation for all watching the usflthe main battle to watch out for in this game will be the panthers defensive line vs the stars offensive line one of the most underrated signing this season was offensive tackle drew himmelman joining the stars and providing some muchneeded relief for quarterback case cookus as we saw in week 9 for the stars himmelmans absence from left tackle changed the whole dynamic of the final drive as airon servais was not able to provide any sort of protection for cookus ultimately leading to a forced fumbleunfortunately for panthers fans i do think the overall experience of the stars may be a bit much as i do think

viewership performance is down significantly from the usfl 2022championship game on fox between thebirmingham stallionsand philadelphia stars whichaveraged 1517 million viewersusfl championship game rating analysisits challenging to come up with a positive spin on the ratings for the 2023 usfl championship gamethe usfls viewership numbers were down across the board from last season the league struggled to generate added interest and build upon its inaugural season in 2022 even the lure of a championship game didnt draw in the type of boost sports leagues typically get for their title gamethe increase in overtheair network games along with the added promotion across two major networks and stabilized weekend time slots didnt aid the usfl in seeing growth in year twotheres definitely enough evidence now of a limited ceiling for viewership for this specific productoverall in the landscape the numbers are passable depending on your perspective but the lack of growth and added interest for the usfl in year two is troublesomefinding ways to draw in casual and mainstream sports fans has always been a challenge for these entities no matter the quality of the football or the broadcasts themselveson a positive note the usfl as expected will be back for season threeas a lifelong advocate of nonnfl pro football leagues and the benefits derived from their existence in the landscape having a season three for a spring pro football league is a victorythe challenge becomes finding a way to accomplish what the usfl didnt in 2022 in terms of increasing its popularity and product awarenessquite frankly the usfl is seeing a year three because of its lowrisk financial model but in order for the league to have sustainable success they need to find a way to connect with fans who have ignored the product specifically with their teams that carry the namesake of cities but do not play in their marketsits beating a dead horse at this point but the bottom line is that the lack of an instadium atmosphere has an impact on the usfls tv and overall product its hurt perception and has affected attendance viewership and interest in teams with the namesakes of their cities who dont reside therepeople in pittsburgh and new jersey barely know that the maulers and generals exist because they dont have a connection with their cities their existence is a hollow one until that changesdespite the usfls best efforts and desires to place all their teams in their markets the league hasnt been able to shift from its lowcost hub concept the failure of being able to sell their league and teams to fans and cities is what has held the league backafter two years the usfl still seems like an incomplete product perhaps that will change over time but until it becomes a fullyfledged traditional pro sports league with all teams in their actual markets the pattern of year two will repeat itself in year three2023 usfl tv ratings by week average viewership per

was 13 xfl 12 usfl 2022agreed on engagement its why usfl needs to play in philly with nj or philly and nj both  even 23 games each there to get local mediapressfan engagement fan engagement in minimarkets like memphisbirm or future nola wont be much for tvagreed on cost effectiveness is keeping usfl in game for now xfl doesnt have that  yetall in all usfl season avg 631k xfl 634k and usfl 747k 2022 but when adjusting out week 1 and looking at weeks 2championshipusfl 2023 weeks 2 thru championship 2023 615k 39 gamesusfl 2022 weeks 2 thru championship 2022 653k 35 gamesxfl 2023 weeks 2 thru championship 2023 567k 39 gamesand while espn is not a broadcast its viewership typically is on par for sports so the xfl had 22 games abcespn and usfl 29 foxnbc clearly the overlap hurt both leagues esp week 1 of usfl but where xfl excelled was espn2fx while usfls usa dropped from 331k to 233k and fs1 avg only 294k xfls fx 429k and espn2 456k kudos to xfldisney for those s at 180k more per game cable that was where the diff between the leagues was it cost usfl 58k per game viewership compared to xflboth leagues have areas to improve they both have a firm base to work from their leagues are obviously very similar but their strength weaknesses are slightly diffconcern without some coordination or outright mergercombo both will not reach full potential and may both fold thats my concern from day xfl announced returnpersonal note with twitter access bs the more articles vs tweets would be greatreplybarneyjuly 6 2023 at 658 pmhaving a joke of a team like pittsburgh who was 46 made the game seem ridiculous tooreplyken granitojuly 7 2023 at 1224 ami have already commented greatly on what i would do to help the league grow as i have stated i dont know all of the headwinds the league faces but i have an idea of what they could be i appreciate the attempt to get more teams into their home cities in 2023 they did a great job that stated the ratings did not reflect the improvement in the league a good amount of that is due to having competition from a league that paid a little more to get better known players and playing in games across the country hitting every time zone i have been and continue to be a proponent of the usfl but i think moose johnston feels like he lost even though they hit on their plans for year 2 it likes the rays playing the yankees over the years the rays could institute their plans and be a strong team but the yankees would use their payroll and have more talent when the chips are down now the xfl lost a reported 60 million dollars and moose feels like he lost you cant have 3 teams in a league be able to root for their home team and i think he knows that i expect there to be more teams in their home markets in 2024 hopefully all of them this will help their ratings by having more people connected to their teams i think they would increase ratings by increasing their footprint including to the west coast including san diego but i respect the plan they put in place it would be great to see what they do and i look forward to seeing what they put in placereplyshawnjuly 8 2023 at 1148 amfisrt off the usfl needs to adopt the cfls playoff structure let 1st seed have bye round have seeds 2  3 play wild card so only 4th seed misses playoffwhy do this cuz every dang team will play their hearts out not to be the 4th seedcan you imagine houston coming up and beating birmingham to play championship not likely but to say it cant happen is foolishsecondly i think that and putting teams in home market will boost attendancebut i still struggle why ppl think you cant enjoy a game unless there are fans in stands how does that take away from gameplay it doesnt but some are still hung up on thatall out regardless of names usfl is far superior to xflwhy do xfl think they are development league you get guys who went from ncaa to nfl and then go to xfl and revert to ncaa rules when your trying to get back to nflhow is that deveoping players and getting them ready to go back to nfl plus the kickoffssafer i dont see a lot of injuries on kick returns in usfl so that seems bs just saying plus again developing players to play in formation that will never be adopted by nfl at least the usfl has just taken the nfl and made it bettereveryone knows that in nfl games if your team is down by 4 points in 4th with 30 left to play after scoring td then game is over no chance at all for onside kick as they have ruined that chance and only i think less than 4 success if that do teams recoverat least usfl games can literally go down to the last tick of clockanother thing for usfl to do is make subscription like nfl game pass so fans can watch all games anytime plus add all usfl related content be awesome if they could get rights to og league games and let fans watch those alsoas long as they dont start out with too high a price for packagei think ppl would pay for that service if availableyet i fear the two leagues will end up trying to out do each other and both will failthe only reason xfl has the name power and attendance is cuz the rock is coowner and anything rocks involved sellsor so they think but when u see his name on team jersey then its more about him hopefully the usfl wins out but since it has an american theme it probably wont in our society cuz america bad lolreplyken granitojuly 22 2023 at

their first game in the state in nearly 40 years bill shea  the athleticwhile the longterm outlook for the usfl certainly remains unknown  fox has committed 150 million to it over three seasons  it certainly appears that the league is doing what it can to build a local fanbase and an enjoyable gameday experience apart from the actual football which will be a problem if they dont win home games  detroiters already have one team at ford field they love to hateadvertisementwhile it may not be fair because theyre not intended to be competing products its hard not to compare sundays game to a lions game the crowd was limited to the lower bowl with the upper decks and most of the end zones blocked off if they had about 15000 fans at the game and well never know how many tickets were free versus bought thats a nice crowd for what the usfl isand its certainly cheaper than an nfl game as the product would dictatei paid 65 for two tickets  25 each plus 11 in service fees and 4 for a facility charge via ticketmaster  for seats in section 106 row 8 that put us behind the visitor bench on the side of ford field with an enormous wall of suites behind us with press row seven stories up we also were eyelevel behind the fox camera cart zipping back and forthmasking off the upper bowl makes sense because you want as many people at camera level in the stadium as possible and its more efficient for stadium staff concessions and janitorial crews when everyone isnt spread around the venuethe og panthers played nearly an hour north in pontiac which was the lions home from 19752001 the original panthers were getting about 11000 fans while losing early home games then doubling or tripling that when they started to winhebert who famously had a cajun accent that was hard for his teammates to understand in the huddle took in sundays game from a ford field suite now a sports radio host doing new orleans saints pre and postgame shows hebert happily shared his panthers player days memories about his 250000 rookie contract that lifted him out of poverty and his admiration for ford fieldthis is awesome i didnt realize this is 20 years old it looks unbelievable he saidit also was a rare visit to downtown detroit for hebert who spent his time living in pontiac detroit was mostly a ghost town for offduty football players back then he saidadvertisementwe never came downtown there was a place called greektown thats it hebert saidnow 62 hebert remains confident his 1983 team would have won a headtohead meeting with the lionsi think we would have beat the lions we had 28 teams and i think wed have been anywhere from 14 to 18 in the nfl he said lack of depth plagued the usfl he said but it overall was a great experience for himhow could i have bad memories of michigan everything was great i loved it he said i loved my time hereherbert spoke to the crowd at halftime and the 1983 panthers cheer squad was brought onto the field to cheers the pregame hype video included original panthers footage and audio including a celebration of the 1983 championship game  something the new usfl can use after rights litigation prevented it last year at games or on tvthe

yesterday wasnt enough today stars fans got more good news kj costello the backup quarterback for 2022 is returning but an intriguing new offensive weapon has been added wide receiver corey coleman a former firstround pick of the cleveland browns several years ago has been signed by the philadelphia stars to play in the 2023 usfl seasoncoleman and costello both spent time with nfl teams in 2022 while costello was climbing the professional ladder coleman was doing his best to latch on with the future super bowl champion kansas city chiefs neither would find a longlasting home and ultimately wind up free agents ripe for the picking the philadelphia stars once again show the usfl theyre playing chess while the rest of the league is playing checkershaving brought back every player who left for the nfl except maurice alexander who stuck with detroit the team has continued adding pieces from the xfl and nfl to further their pursuit of a fifth championship appearance in a row dating back to usfl 10 for the stars as a teamkj costello returnskj costello got a bad rap last year stepping in for case cookus in the regular season and later in the championship game playing in 2 regular season games he completed 4 of 10 passes for 69 yards no touchdowns or interceptions he also lost 15 yards on 5 carriescostello is still very young at only 25 years old he had a stint with the chargers in 2021 before he was released and signed with the stars for the 2022 season after a lessthanstellar regular season performance costello would enter the championship game after case cookus suffered a broken legentering the game in the second half costello had an upanddown outing first he stepped into the game and threw an immediate interception scooby wright intercepted the pass and rumbled 46 yards for a touchdown then on the next drive he hung in there in a pass delivering a beautiful touchdown strike while getting leveled by a defender this put the stars within 3 points with a little over a minute remainingcanton oh june 25 philadelphia stars quarterback kj costello 19 passes the ball during the usfl playoff game against the new jersey generals on june 25 2022 at tom benson hall of fame stadium in canton ohio photo by joe robbinsicon sportswire via getty imagesby the time the stars got the defensive stop they needed and got the ball back there were 51 seconds left drives like these are how legends are born and backups become starters unfortunately for stars fans this was when costello proved he still has some developing to do primarily in the decisionmaking departmentcostello would let it rip on 2nd and 3 after extending the play intended for diondre overton he had held the ball too long allowing the defender to jump the route when he finally threw the ball this resulted in a gamedealing interception that ended the game costello was blasted for his performance with fans all but forgetting his gutsy touchdown passrole with the stars in 2023returning to the stars for 2023 wasnt necessarily an easy choice for costello he isnt in line for a starting position in fact with the stars having signed kevin thomson this offseason he has competition for the qb2 position thomson a former cfl quarterback is no slouch and has similar experience to costelloultimately i see a scenario unfolding where costello is the primary backup early in the season but gives way to thomson eventually costello has the advantage in the early going due to previous knowledge of the playbook however i dont think this will be enough for him to hold onto the qb2 spotcorey colemana former firstround pick by the cleveland browns coleman was selected 15th overall in 2016 after a solid college career that saw him improve year over year he lit up the nfl combine running a sub 44 40yard dash was enough to get scouts looking but it was his 405inch vertical leap and 10foot 9inch broad jump that displayed the lower body explosiveness coleman possessed with the requisite talent and athleticism as well as the production to back it 34 games 173 receptions for 3009 yards and 33 touchdowns coleman looked like a safe bet in the middle of the first roundit wasnt until he got to cleveland that the team started to see chinks in his armor it started right away with coleman missing most of the preseason due to an injury this would foreshadow a lot of what happened during his nfl career coleman had been expected to be a starter in place of current seattle sea dragon josh gordon who was shocker suspended for the first 6 games of the season this rocky start didnt do him any favors for his future in clevelandhe would return to play in two games showcasing his patented speed he caught 7 passes in two games racking up 173 total yards unfortunately after flashing his talent he broke his hand in practice forcing him to miss even more time as a rookie he would return and start 10 out of 16 games that season he finished the season with 33 receptions for 413 yards and 3 touchdowns adding 2 carries for 10 yards not exactly what the browns had hoped when they selected him in the first roundyear two yields more strugglesin year two he returned to the browns presumably as a starter once again after playing in two games he again broke his same hand this time he missed 7 games before returning to the field in november playing in 9 games with 8 starts coleman saw his receptions yards and touchdowns dip managing just 23 receptions for 305 yards and 2 touchdownsheading into year 3 the browns were featured on hard knocks which gave us a sneak peek into the mindset of coleman when after two seasons he was no longer receiving firstteam reps he would go speak with the coaches demanding to be traded away from cleveland after dropping the pass that sealed an 016 season for the browns they were happy to oblige shipping coleman to buffalo before the 2018 season for a 7thround pickbuffalo would ultimately cut coleman during final cuts leaving him a free agent and not bringing him back on the practice squad signed on september 11th 2018 by the bills division rival the patriots coleman again was released just 6 days later in favor of josh gordon his former teammate he would spend 9 days on the practice squad before moving on to the giantsnew man in new yorkafter the better part of a year off the field and on practice squads coleman was signed to the active roster on october 25th he would play in 8 games for the giants serving as a receiver and kick returner he caught 5 passes for 71 yards averaging over 14 yards per reception he added 1 carry for 5 yards but did most of his damage in the return gamein just 8 games he collected 23 kick returns for 598 yards averaging 26 yards per return with 2 returns over 40 yards he also added a 19yard punt return on his only attempt he returned to the giants in 2019 poised to take a step forward in his career unfortunately he tore his acl on the first day of training camp forcing him to miss the entire seasondespite this he again returned to the giants in 2020 resigning with the team just days after the league year began as a restricted free agent he had a 2025 million tender which the giants did opt to pay on september 6th during final cuts coleman was released he wasnt done yet with big blue returning in october on the practice squad he would stick for just under a month being released in novembershortly after the season ended news broke coleman had failed a test for performanceenhancing drugs causing him to miss six games in 2021 if signed he ultimately didnt sign with any teams for 2021 after a full season away from the game in 2022 he was signed by the chiefs in late march he would again last most of the offseason but end up released before the season began on august 30th he would be resigned to the practice squad just two weeks later he spent just under a month on the practice squad before the chiefs cut bait for good meaning coleman did not receive a super bowl ringrole with the starsat 511 180 lbs coleman is a burner he has the necessary speed to be a deep threat and the size to play outside or inside if needed one thing about his game that no nfl team ever really utilized during his career was his running ability thats right the stars could have been sending us a subtle message as to what kind of role we could see from coleman in 2023 during his college career coleman ran the ball 33 times for 164 yards and 1 touchdownam i saying he will run anywhere near that much with the stars no but the possibility for coleman to fill those carries if and when needed is there this versatility cant be ignored when it comes to ending up on a roster in spring football whether its as a runner receiver or return man coleman can help the stars in many ways this is a lowrisk highreward signingpaul terry rbwr releasedpaul terry who spent the 2022 season with the stars split time as a runner and a receiver for the stars offense however his time with bart andrus and

justapril 9 2023a very intelligent coach once told me i dont have backups on my team i have a roster full of starters one play away from their opportunity that coach has won backtoback championships in his respective league the stars seem to live and die by a similar philosophy signing players they see as potential starting caliber players across the boardthis was put on display last season when the stars were forced to play three different quarterbacks and four different running backs we saw it again when adam rodriguez the eventual team sack leader and second in the league started the season as a backup all three positions not only required all of their initial depth but players brought in off the street to fill needs like kj costello and dexter williamswith final cut downs coming there were sure to be some great players cut in this instance the writing was on the wall for these three players but not due to their talent but due to when they joined the team one player in particular on this list was signed just six days before final cuts and had a delay in his medical info coming back by the time that info arrived he was being informed that he was let go due to final cutdown that player was a former nfl free safetyreleasedwr devon williamsrb jordan scarlettdb devantecross philadelphia stars usflstars april 4 2023devante cross free safetycross was placed in an uphill battle before he even signed with the team given that the stars had brought back cody brown ladarius wiley joshua moon and evan worthington back even though cross brings the necessary size 62 215 pounds and speed 45 range to dominate at this levelafter originally entering college as a quarterback he was first asked to play some wide receiver before settling in on defense during his redshirt freshman season cross still listed as a quarterback managed to see time on offense collecting 5 carries for 27 yards 1 reception for 8 yards and 3 tackles as virginia figured out how to use himin his second season he was listed as a wide receiver but caught just 1 pass for 20 yards and a touchdown while collecting 13 tackles and 1 interception in his first experience on defense finally in 2019 his fourth season with the school he would be moved to safety full time he would immediately become a key contributor on defense for the cavaliers playing in all 14 games he collected 60 tackles 4 for a loss 1 sack 2 ints and 6 passes deflectedin 2020 playing in just 10 games his tackles dropped off but he still managed 30 total 2 for a loss 1 sack 2 ints and 4 passes deflected his final season saw more of the same a late season injury prevented him from playing more than 8 games which resulted in his statistics dropping off he had 24 tackles 1 interception and 5 pass deflections this late season injury prevented him from participating in the combine or running the 40 in his pro dayi believe this directly resulted in him landing undrafted this late injury and his lack of a pro day or combine appearance caused teams to shy away washington brought him in for their rookie minicamp and later after being released he spent time with the green bay packers signing with the stars represented his best chance to showcase his skills since college i expect cross to land somewhere soon in speaking with him he has his sights set on the cfl for now but it wouldnt shock me to see another usfl team or an xfl team come calling looking for late season depthdevon williams wide receiverdevon williams might be a case of right player wrong position at 65 210 pounds he ran a 465 40yard dash coming out of university of oregon he began at usc but transferred utilizing a redshirt when he arrived at oregon he spent two years on the field for the ducks playing in 18 games he managed to amass 50 receptions for 843 yards and 6 touchdownsoriginally regarded as an athlete as a dual threat quarterback coming out of college williams never got the chance to fully develop as a wide receiver at the college level and lacked the top end speed to really do the same damage he did in college however williams reminds me a lot of another stars player coming out of college bug howard howard was 65 221 pounds coming out of college in 2017 he ran a 458 40 yard dash and managed a 375 inch vertical considering howard ran faster and jumped higher while he weighed more than williams and he moved to tight end perhaps this is a move that williams needs to entertain to save his careeri believe williams would be an asset as a tight end and if you look at recent success converting wide receivers to tight end in alternative football leagues sage surratt and cody latimer have paved the way for this path if williams even added 2030 pounds he would be at 230240 pounds and essentially be the same size as howard maybe at some point we even see an alternative football team take a chance on jj arcegawhiteside for the same reasonmy concern with williams would be his current lack of strength to hold up in the run game as a blocker at tight end he put up just 7 reps of 225 pounds at his pro day to put that into perspective howard had 15 hitting the weight room will be imperative for the success of this transitionwilliams has spent time with the baltimore ravens and the philadelphia stars but neither team had him move positions it will be interesting to see if his next team does as a tight end williams could be a matchup nightmare facing safeties and linebackers but as a wide receiver he struggles to create separation lacks short area foot quickness and is slow getting in and out of breaks against cornerbacksjordan scarlett running backjordan scarlett has the pedigree as a former nfl draft pick but he doesnt have the experience teams would like drafted in round 5 of the 2019 nfl draft scarlett was originally selected by the carolina panthers to add depth to their backfield and special teams unitshowever by 2020 he had already been released left to fight for a role with detroit after signing with their practice squad in december of 2020 less than a month later he signed a futures contract with miami he would stick with the dolphins until final cuts before being released he would bounce on and off miamis practice squad that seasonin 2022 he looked to other options originally signing with the montreal alouettes lasting just two months scarlett stayed in canada and found a new team edmonton signed him a month after he was released but he lasted just 11 days heading back to the united states in 2023 they had already brought back matt colburn and dexter williams who were free agents they also had darnell holland and paul terry bringing in scarlett made for a much too crowded backfield and terry was the first to gothe stars were never expected to carry four running backs so it was only a matter of time before another name was released after sitting on the open market for about 5 months and signing with the stars later in the free agency process scarlett became the odd man out the stars opted to move forward with matt colburn and dexter williams as the 12 punch and darnell holland as the change of pace and third down backchoosing holland always meant scarlett was likely the odd man out on the surface it appeared that these two men were direct competition for each other holland had the upper hand having played for these coaches not only last season but in the tsl before the usfl was formed this advantage proved to be all holland neededscarlett on the other hand could be a name to watch for other running back needy teams three nfl teams two cfl and one usfl teams have already given him a chance that in itself should prove he belongs in the pros i expect to see scarlett end up signing midseason with another usfl team or perhaps an xfl team late in the season given his special teams value he is not just a running back to most squads another reason why i expect him to be signedtransferred player to injured reserve listlb darius hodge philadelphia stars usflstars april 3 2023in other news the stars lost their fourth and fifth players to the reserve list when defensive and darius hodge was added to the list he joins tight end bug howard quarterback kj costello and offensive lineman jahair jones the team also will miss jordan more due to suspension to start the seasondarnell holland is the latest loss announced that he was placed on the injured reserve list this creates an interesting scenario in the run game do we see the stars bring back paul terry or jordan scarlett as rb3 or do we see the stars turn to chris rowland who filled that emergency running back role at times last season i would venture a guess we see the stars bring back one of the backs that was cut if i had to guess i would lean towards jordan scarlett who was let go more recently than terry i am more than confident in chris rowlands abilities as a runner given his background as a running back in high school and his experience running the ball in college as wellcheck out my more in depth article about rowlands abilities as a runner herewith darnell holland on reserve for philadelphia stars is chris rowland in line for more touchestransferred player to injured reserve listrb darnell holland philadelphia stars usflstars april 8 2023the stars were not yet done with cuts yet and three more players faced the ax of the turk as they call it this ended up with three more players who have nfl experience being shed from the rosterkelvin harmon wide recieverkelvin harmon is a receiver who spent three seasons in the nfl on an active roster with the washington commanders at 62 215 pounds he has the necessary size and athleticism to be a big time contributor at the usfl level however it appears it will not be with the stars the liberian born wideout was a player i looked at a near lock in the receiver room because of how much he contributed early on in his nfl careerthree seasons removed from his rookie year harmon has some work to do to convince teams he still has what it takes to continue playing at this level i would not be shocked to see him surface in the cfl for their 2023 season given that the xfl is nearly over and the cfl hasnt entered camp as of yet in fact im hoping the ottawa redblacks take a chance on harmon i believe harmon can be a big time performer at this alternative football level he only needs a chanceit certainly wasnt an accident that he was drafted in round 6 in 2019 and went on immediately to make an impact as a rookie targeted 44 times he caught 30 passes for 365 yards and produced 16 first downs i would expect given the right offense harmon is at worst a 3 receiver in the usflxflcfl levelantwan owens defensive lineantwan owens is a player who was on the stars last season and a valuable one at that his size and versatility to play inside or outside was tremendous for the stars unfortunately for owens he was not the only player on the roster looking to fill the role he was slated for owens having began his career at georgia tech transferred to jackson state and finished his career under coach primea rookie in 2022 joining the team just months after his football season ended at jackson state owens made an impact that cant be quantified from a stat sheet although he collected just 12 tackles he was tasked with eating up double teams on one side of the line in order to free up premier pass rushers like adam rodriguez on the other sideat 64 265 lbs owens made sense as a strongside defensive end however he had gained weight and was up to 280 pounds this offseason which in my opinion made him much better suited to play interior defensive line while still being able to rush the passer from that position unfortunately for owens the stars chose to move forward with ralph holley filling this role the stars currently hold 5 defensive tackles including holley who could see snaps at defensive end despite playing at 285 poundsthey also kept three pure pass rushers on the active roster as well as hodge on the reserve list i am excited about the players at defensive end adam rodriguez returns having collected the second most sacks in the usfl during the 2022 season with 9 while ali fayad and carson taylor both bring the skillset needed to put the pressure on opposing passers all season longdare rosenthal offensive tackleeven after the move to release rosenthal the stars are carrying four tackles 4 guards and 2 centers these are the exact numbers i would have expected to see on the offensive line as you can never have too much depth carrying a backup for each individual position is a move most nfl teams make when as well this increases the success rate of these depth players when called uponrosenthal is the exact type of player that needs a spring football league to get where he wants to be which is of course in the nfl rosenthal committed to lsu as a 4 star defensive tackle before redshirting in the 2018 season and making the move to offensive line standing 67 327 pounds coming out of college he has the necessary size to dominate at the position if given the proper coachingduring his first season after the position change he would play in 5 games at left guard starting three of those games the following season in 2020 he moved to left tackle where he played in seven games starting five but missed multiple games due to injury andor suspension that season not a good look at the time for a guy who needed the playing time to further develop as an offensive linemanafter a tumultuous season in 2020 with lsu he decided it was in his best interests to transfer out of the program this landed him with university of kentucky where he would start 12 games at left tackle for the school with just two seasons of playing time as a left tackle another handful of games at left guard and multiple years playing defense before that you can see why rosenthal needs to continue his developmenthe has all the necessary tools to develop into a future nfl offensive lineman in fact he was expected to be picked as high as the 5th round of his athletic ability alone but fell undrafted he would spend some time with the atlanta falcons during the 2022 season but didnt stick turning his focus instead to the usfl while he didnt stay with the stars i would keep an eye on his name as a midseason free agent pickup following injuriesfinal words about final cutsthe stars have arguably one of the best rosters in the league i will continue to echo these sentiments until the other teams in the league prove me wrong during the season after watching how the stars performed last season and seeing the moves they made this offseason i am encouraged that the team took the necessary steps and improved enough to collect their third championship victory and fifth appearance in five triesall six of these players released spent time on nfl rosters at some point they clearly have what it takes to play professional football it wouldnt be a surprise to see any of these three players turn up on another usfl roster a xfl or cfl roster or maybe even an nfl practice squad at some point in 2023 perhaps one of the indoor teams come calling hoping to convince a guy to come play for a few weeks and keep freshif any league should be poaching these outgoing usfl and xfl free agents it should be the national arena league with no salary cap and many of these players having experience playing both ways in college or before hand why not give them a look dare rosenthal and rico gafford in particular among this last set of cuts would make a lot of sense for the league given their experience playing both offense and defense in collegeif youre a fan of the stars check out our interviews with stars players including

team indicate that the quarterback competition is coming down to end with josh love and carson strong both battling it out valiantly personally i believe josh love gets the nod over strong due to

secondhalf shutout to seal the winon the other hand the showboats fell just short of a remarkable comeback attempt they trailed 2010 at half but crawled their way back and had a chance to take the lead in the final minute of the game however brady white couldnt connect with his receivers late and turned the ball over on downs to lose 2723the stallions will look quite different at various

2023key to the game running the ballthe run game was one of birminghams strengths last season but has quickly shifted into one of the teams weaknesses in 2023in the season opener birmingham rushed for 87 yards and a touchdown on paper that doesnt sound all that bad except for the part where quarterback alex mcgough accounted for 51 yards and the score without him the rest of the team would have combined for 36 yards on 16 carries that is 23 yards per attempt not goodthe stallions will also be without bo scarbrough admittedly he didnt have his best outing in week 1 but still boasts as a huge threat on offense that will be missed they still have cj marable and activated zaquandre white to the active roster nevertheless one of these two are going to have to find a way to consistently gain positive yardage on the ground and take some of the responsibility of mcgoughs backbirmingham stallions vs memphis showboats predictionthe spread tells the story in this one as the stallions enter the contest as a touchdownplus favorite despite that the team cannot afford to take this game too lightly theyve heavy favorites in this one which could give memphis all the motivation they need to pull off the road upsetthe stallions offense is going to be the deciding factor in this game they moved the ball well in week 1 but are dealing with multiple injuries and it will be interesting to see how the group meshes together of course alex mcgough and cj marable have plenty of ingame reps but someone in the receiver room will need to step up without williams the ball cant go to jace sternberger every drop back or else the stallions will be in troublerealistically the team is going to have some issues without some of the stars on offense and the leaders on defense there will be some hiccups and probably some mental lapses for the stallions in this game however despite the injuries stacking up expect birmingham to pull away in the second half and remain undefeated through two

gamblers 12 vs philadelphia stars 12saturday 1 pm et on fox and the fox sports appthe houston gamblers appear to be on the rise the philadelphia stars appear to be slipping is this the week either of those things changethe gamblers are coming off a spectacular comefrombehind victory over the memphis showboats in week 3 while the stars have lost backtoback games for the first time since the usfl returned to action last seasonthis will be the stars second game in detroit in as many weeks and when they take on the gamblers saturday 1 pm et on fox and the fox sports app theyll hope to change their fortunes from week 3will the stars get back to early season formafter the first game of the season it looked like the philadelphia stars would have no problem making it back to the usfl championship the next week ended up as a bit of a reality check as philadelphia lost to the michigan panthers who look to be much improved over last seasonthings really went off the rails last week when quarterback case cookus threw two interceptions for the second game in a row philadelphia had a total of three turnovers in the game which proved too much to overcomethe stars are averaging a leagueworst 275 yards per carry not allowing cookus any sort of run game to lean onthat being said the stars are holding their own in the passing attack averaging 2203 passing yards per game which ranks third in the league their leading receiver corey coleman already has 311 allpurpose yards this season 211 of which are as a receiver philadelphia also has the thirdbest thirddown conversion rate of any team in the league converting at a 444 rate if they can supplement that with a more balanced offense the stars should be able to return to formcan gamblers keep rollingrunning back mark thompson returned to his 2022 standards in week 3 after leading the league in rushing yards last season thompson found that form against the showboats finishing with 84 yards on 21 carries and a pair of touchdowns the gamblers leaned heavily on their ground game to ensure last weeks win finishing with a total of 132 rushing yards overalleven as memphis mounted a comeback late in the game the houston defense held on just enough to give the gamblers offense one last possession quarterback kenji bahar then drove his unit the length of the field winning the game on a touchdown pass to wide receiver justin hall his second score of the gamei peeked and the corner had left hall said after the game he went with the outside receiver and i just knew i was wide open kenji bahar made a great pass the oline held their own everybody did their 1of11 and we ended up with the winit was set up by a beautiful long ball over the middle to tight end josh pederson if houston can keep its offense clicking the stars will have their hands full trying to get back in the win column by carmen vitalimemphis showboats 03 vs michigan panthers 21saturday 730 pm et on nbcthe michigan panthers are coming off their first loss of the season while the memphis showboats are looking for their first winthat will be the overarching storyline on saturday when the two teams kick off a full weekend slate of usfl games between detroit and cantonmichigan opened play in the usfls muchanticipated return to detroit last week on hand were detroit sports legends ben wallace and calvin johnson as the raucous crowd cheered on the hometown team but the new jersey generals proved too much for the panthers exploiting run lanes and amassing 198 yards on the ground against mike nolans squad jersey seemingly provided the blueprint for how to attack the previously streaking panthers and the showboats should take noticemeanwhile memphis sits in the cellar of this weeks power rankings and its in large part due to their lack of a ground game showboats running backs carried the ball just 11 times for a total of four yards last sunday fixing that should be priority no 1 as the showboats come into detroitcan panthers offensive stars get back on trackjosh love came into week 3 as the unquestioned starter for the panthers having earned usfl offensive player of the week to open the season the gap between him and backup carson strong seemed significantbut love struggled against the generals finishing 15 of 31 for 101 yards and throwing an interception into double coverage meanwhile strong who was put in to finish out the first half engineered a nineplay 66yard drive that was capped off with the panthers only touchdown of the game love was put back in to start the second half but despite possessing the ball for 30 of the first 37 plays came up with just one field goal to show for itnot only was loves performance lacking but michigans other offensive spark running back reggie corbin had an uncharacteristically down day new jersey held him to just 38 rushing yards on eight carriesprovided both love or maybe even strong can get going under center against a struggling memphis team with the help of corbin on the ground the panthers should be able to right the ship not only this week but again in week 5 against pittsburgh which sits at no 7 in fox sports latest power rankingswill showboats get their first win of the seasonyes memphis is sitting at the bottom of the south division but there is a glimmer of hope in former southeastern louisiana quarterback cole kelley despite last weeks loss to the houston gamblers kelley completed 21 of 38 passes for a whopping 307 yards and two touchdowns against one interceptionthe showboats even tied the game against the gamblers last week on a fourthdown trick play that saw running back alex collins take the direct snap and float a pass to tight end jay jay wilson in the back of the end zone for the scoreand while he got help under center the problem was that kelley didnt get much help in the way of a balanced offense overall if memphis can figure out its rushing woes and kelley has another game like last week it wont be long before the showboats show something in the win column by carmen vitalinew orleans breakers 30 vs new jersey generals 21sunday 3 pm et on nbcthe lone undefeated team remaining in the usfl the new orleans breakers 30 take their perfect record on the road to face the new jersey generals 21 3 pm et at tom benson hall of fame stadium in canton ohio on sundayled by firstyear head coach john defilippo the breakers have been one of the pleasant surprises of the usfl so far this season knocking off the defending champs the birmingham stallions in a 4531 shootout last weekthe breakers take on another team playing well in the generals after losing in week 1 to the stallions new jersey has won two straight including a 2813 victory over the michigan panthers at ford field in week 3heres one big question for the breakers and generals to consider as they head into this weekends matchupnew orleans breakers can defilippo keep this offense rollingthrough three weeks the breakers have the usfls leading passer in mcleod bethelthompson 857 yards the leading rusher in wes hills 301 yards and the leading receiver in tight end sage surratt 257 yardsthe breakers also lead the league in total yards 393 and points scored per game 35so what can the breakers do for an encorewe put ourselves in the position to be at the top of the division defilippo said and obviously that was one of our goals at the beginning of the season and it is very attainable but we have to keep going we are not even close we are not even close to being there so it is pedal to the metalnew orleans gets another tough test by taking on a new jersey defense that is holding opponents to a leaguelow 143 points per gamedefensively the generals are led by linebacker chris orr who has 28 combined tackles and a sack through three games joining orr in new jerseys strong effort on that side of the ball are defensive linemen tyshun render two sacks and toby johnson 15 sacks along with cornerback dj daniel two interceptionsthis guy has played some really good football for us generals head coach mike riley said about daniel he has taken advantage of being in the usfl and developing his playing skills and he takes it real serious so im really proud with how hes playedand defensively weve really made it hard on teamsnew jersey generals can darius victor play keep away from explosive breakers offensewhile the breakers have the topscoring offense in the league the generals lead the usfl in rushing by averaging 169 yards a contestvictor tops new jersey with 228 rushing yards on 32 carries for 71 yards per carry victor also has two rushing touchdownsthe offensive player of the year in the usfl last season victor will have to run well to give the generals a chance to slow down new orleans highoctane offensehowever it could be tough sledding for new jerseys offense on the ground as the breakers have held teams to just 76 yards per game by eric d williamsbirmingham stallions 21 vs pittsburgh maulers 12sunday 630 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports appskip holtz and the birmingham stallions 21 are looking to get back to their winning ways when they face the pittsburgh maulers 12 in the second game of a sunday doubleheader at tom benson memorial stadium 630 pm et on fs1 and the fox sports appthe defending usfl champions lost their first game of the season last week against the new orleans breakers giving up 45 points in the lossthe stallions will look to improve defensively against a pittsburgh offense that finally found a spark last week with maulers head coach ray horton earning his first victory 2113 over the philadelphia starsi hope what happens is the guys now trust and believe in the process of what were doing horton said obviously will be playing birmingham this weekend and it offers another chance to do something different whatever they bring to the table so what will try to do is build obviously success and confidence go hand and hand  for us its trust and beliefbirmingham stallions how can defense limit explosive playsthe stallions allowed nine plays of 20plus yards against the breakers in birminghams 4531 humbling loss last week so limiting big plays will be a point of emphasis defensively for the stallions when they face pittsburgh on the roadbirmingham has allowed a leaguehigh 153 rushing yards per contest through three gamesi thought they played more physical than we did holtz said about his teams loss to new orleans i thought in the trenches on both sides of the ball they won the line of scrimmage and its hard to win a football game like that theyve got a good football team and they wanted it i told the team you wear that crown for a while and if you start believing it its going to eat you upholtz said hes hopeful to get a couple of players back on defense  including linebacker scooby wright  to help tighten things up on the side of the ball the stallions face a pittsburgh offense that ran for 137 yards in last weeks win over the stars led by quarterback troy williams who rushed for 65 yards on seven carriespittsburgh maulers can maulers continue to ride kicker chris blewittits unusual for a team to get a spark from a kicker but thats what happened for pittsburgh when blewitt joined the team last weekwhen chris first came in he was just warming up and he kept moving back and back and back horton said we brought the whole group up just to put a little pressure on him and he made a 62yarder with room to spareand i think the guys thought here we go little things mean a lot and chris means a lot to usblewitt finished 5for5 on field goals last week including a long of 50 yards but he missed his only extrapoint attemptthe maulers also have benefited from strong returns on special teams isaiah hennie leads the league in punt return yards with 161 hennie has 82 and 53yard punt returns to his credit already this season while teammate josh simmons had a 56yard kickoff return last weekthe big returns created short fields for the maulers making it easier for the offense to get into scoring position last week horton also made the switch from james morgan to williams at quarterback in week 3 and the utah products added dimension as a runner helped create more juice for the maulers on offensewhether its dance or music you feel the rhythm horton said about the improved way his offense performed last week and to me it just had a different look throughout the week the players took ownership of what we were doing and responsibility and i think thats what it was more than anything by eric d

in this game will be new jerseys passing attack mike rileys lowvolume pass game only works if there is high efficiency a year ago the generals did just that making big plays when opportunities to do

peacock per mike mitchell of usflnewshubcom nbc averaged the highest per game viewership in season 1 with over 11 million while so far viewership is down quite a bit from season one at the same pointsunday saw the usfl return on nbc at noon et with a game between the michigan panthers and houston gamblers the telecast averaged974000viewers last seasons nbc sunday afternoon week 1 usfl game averaged 21 million viewers mike mitchells articlei am very curious to see the attendance in this game when the stars play in ford field for the first time while some usfl fans dont care to discuss the more concerning matters of the league color me a sceptic that these attendance numbers can continue long term as the usfl looks for success especially if they can count on an early season slump in viewership when competing with xfl for viewership they need to find ways to attract fans to the teams not representing the city they play in the stars being one of themthe good the bad the uglytwo weeks and nine sacks later case cookus was showing the wear and tear on his body at the end of this game having been banged up for two weeks straight cookus was left to try and erase a 14 point deficit with no time to push the ball downfield getting the ball back with over six minutes remaining the stars couldnt find any momentum and sputtered to a 2410 loss to the michigan panthersinjuries took away two starting offensive linemen leaving our protection issues even worse than before while michigan only put up four sacks cookus was hit early and often after week one coach andrus was asked about the protection woes he attributed it to week one rust being knocked off in a league with only ten weeks and no preseason games there may not be any time to suffer through that rust the stars now sit tied for second place with the generals while michigan gains an early upper hand on their division rival starspoints of emphasis moving forwardgoing forward this offense has to get these issues with protection under control we saw the breakers transition to an offensive set implementing a 6th offensive lineman which worked to neutralize the pass rush of the maulers in week one this changed the whole flow of the game resulting in a victory for new orleansim not saying the stars need to trot 6 linemen out there every play but your roster holds 3 healthy tight ends and many larger receivers these players need to be used to help slow down the opposing pass rush even if you are lining up ryan izzo tight every play and having him chip a defensive end every play allowing the tackle that extra millisecond to get into his set also with two backs that can hold their own in pass blocking why arent we seeing more of that especially when youve watched your quarterback get beat up all day longrun defensethrough the first two weeks the stars have allowed 241 rushing yards and 3 touchdowns reggie corbin by himself had 2 touchdowns and averaged over 11 yards per carry on the day last week alex collins managed 63 yards at 45 yards per carry and a touchdown with white adding 27 yards at 72 yards per carry this can not continue if the stars want to make another trip to the championshipi spoke about it before this game i believe the injuries to the linebacker group and the defensive line has hampered their production and their ability to get penetration and stuff run plays the stars have made an active attempt to add bulk up front but it has yet to pan out last night we saw some improvement at points in time but not steady enough to keep corbin away from 130 yards and the endzone in my opinion lattimore needs to be a guy we build around to stiffen up this run defense he looked to be the most productive interior lineman on sunday i would also like to see more of jordon scott one of the larger defensive linemen brought in to help this run defenseunfortunately part of our issues in the run defense are scheme related the stars like to run a variation of the wide 9 defense which is essentially a slang term for saying we want our defensive ends to attack the outside shoulder of the offensive tackle this front uses smaller faster defensive ends and allows them to pin their ears back and make plays this is a big reason why a guy like adam rodriguez was allowed to rack up 9 sacks last season the scheme uses his speed to beat larger less agile tackles and it works wonders in the passing game however in the run game it by design opens up larger c gap and creates venurabilities that a great running back can exploit this is precisely what happened with reggie corbin corbin is a smaller quicker backits no accident that he took the bulk of the carries in this game eric marty proved his coaching chops by knowing corbins burst and vision would be the perfect combination to exploit these gaps in the meantime coach also provided the blueprint to defeating this stars defensededication to the runthis offseason we saw in my mind what i would amount to a philosophical change on the offensive side of the ball for the stars heading into last season matt colburn was the power back on the roster at 205 lbs darnell holland was our first back off the bench and paul terry a hybrid rbwr was the third back much like the philadelphia eagles the stars ignored the need for a larger back to carry the load and use in short yardage situations instead they intended to spread teams outthis offseason they decided to add a bit more size to the backfield bringing back dexter williams a back who plays a similar style to colburn but brings with him about 1015 more pounds with him and is a bit more adept at short yardage situations they then moved on from paul terry and it looked like we were gearing up for a 12 punch with matt colburn and dexter williams with darnell holland expected to be a change of pace back coming in more in passing situations to utilize his speedif we needed any more evidence that this was the plan we got it when darnell holland was placed on the injured reserve list just before the season began the stars refrained from adding to their backfield instead they looked to chris rowland a wide out to fill these few carries a game to his credit if not for a late game injury he likely wouldve been the only one filling that role however he would end up getting banged up unable to play in week 2 again the stars didnt bring anyone in my thought was they had corey coleman and terry wright two players that can do a lot of the same things rowland did in week onehowever instead we saw a dramatic drop off in running plays called in week one the stars logged 24 carries in week two it dropped to just 15 thats a 38 drop game play of course factors in but it was their choice to abandon the run game that left them throwing the ball 44 times nearly 3 times the frequency they ran this led to the defense keying on the pass and hitting cookus on what felt like every one of his 44 passing attemptssome will point to their lack of success running the ball as to why they moved away from the run i would argue as the game went the run defense for michigan started relinquishing some more yards to put this into perspective during their first three drives the stars produced 4 yards rushing it wasnt until the fifth time the stars held the ball that they had a carry gain more than 2 yards it came on a 3 yard run by corey coleman it was their 6th possession before they hit positive rushing yards on the day at this point sitting at just 5 yards rushing on 6 drives headed into halftimethis signaled a shift in production per run yet it went unnoticed in fact from here on out the run game went largely ignored collecting just 8 more carries all game long it was the run game that tied the game on the stars first possession of the second half on the drive colburn rushed 4 times for 18 yards and 1 touchdown or 45 yards per carry at this point the running game was working and needed to be the focus going through rest of the second half tied 1010 there was no reason to get away from anything that was workinghowever after this initial drive the team as a whole attempted just 4 more carries this complete lack of a run game put case cookus in a tough spot part of why cookus had so much success last season was the balance the stars had on offense colburn averaged around 50 yards by himself rushing each game at this point the team is averaging just 69 yards per game rushing this isnt sustainable unless you want your quarterback hurtkicking gamelast season the stars made a switch from matt mengel who is more of a punter and kickoff specialist than he is a kicker to luis aguilar who is the exact opposite bringing in aguilar did in fact cause our punt unit to suffer but our kicking game with him there was near perfect he finished the season 8 of 10 on field goals and 19 of 19 on extra pointsalready in two games hes missed two field goals and an extra point granted he missed on longdistance kicks with his usfl long 49 yards this is a facet of his game that needs some work if he is looking to get to the nfl its also left 7 points off the board which at this rate seems very important for the offense given the questions about the health of case cookuss shoulderthe injury report this week is must read content with cookus banged up after 9 sacks and countless hits on the qbcould we see vad lee or kevin thomson if the beating continueskeys to victorythe first key to victory is something i asked coach andrus about after week one when unforced errors led directly to points for memphis these unforced errors are what kept the maulers in week one until new orleans was able to make adjustments and slow down the pass rush if not for a punt return touchdown and a fumble recovery return for a touchdown this maulers team is staring at an 02 record with a team that hasnt scored a touchdown since june 19th of 2022if philly continues to give away points like they did to memphis this maulers team has enough talent to capitalize and steel a victory from the stars this victory would drop the stars to fourth place in the division after backtoback losses within the divisionstop the runwe are about to face a team whose entire identity on offense goes through their running backs with madre london garrett groshek and newcomer duane gary who currently leads the team in yards per carry in just two games these three players have combined for 33 carries with another 9 carries coming from various other players on the roster with 42 carries to just 57 passing attempts this is about as balanced an offense gets but the passing game has produced under 4 yards per attempt in my mind its a no brainer that you load up the box and let james morgan or troy williams try and beat us through the air where our defensive strength our secondary liesbetting oddscourtesy of foxsportscomthe stars vs maulers game in detroit for the stars first true home game at their new stadium should be an interesting matchup the stars come into this game as 45 point favorites over pittsburgh but what this doesnt tell us is how these teams matchup and how close this could be if the stars cant slow down this pass rush that gave new orleans fits in week 1moneylinethe stars are 213 favorites while the maulers are 160 underdogs with the overunder set at 445 pointsinjury reportif there were two injuries the stars couldnt have afforded at this point on defense it was the two players we saw transferred to the inactive list this weektransferred player to injured reserve listolb tevon coneydt ralph holley philadelphia stars usflstars april 26 2023with the injuries at linebacker and defensive tackle already losing coney and holley who were key contributors in 2022 was a large blow this defense couldnt afford to sustain i understand that the stars staff is very loyal to these guys and is trying their best to be creative to keep them all on the roster but at this point its week three and we are down two offensive linemen two defensive tackles and three linebackers its time to start making moves to fill some of these holes that have quickly formed the stars went heavy on wide outs quarterback and tight end but now is the time to use this roster construction to your advantage and start shedding some extra players at these positions to bring in depth where neededgame status reportqb case cookus

kneewr chris rowland philadelphia stars usflstars april 29 2023maybe even get creative and go after guys that can play multiple positions i have spoken about it before but looking at national arena league players could prove valuable in a position like this instead of bringing in a guy who strictly plays linebacker you can go out and get a guy like rashad payne who most recently played for the jacksonville sharks payne has played linebacker defensive end tight end and fullback during his professional career a guy like this signed to play linebacker and special teams but who can come in as an extra tight end or a lead blocker at times when needed could be invaluable to a roster that is ailing in many areas payne is also a guy teams should be familiar with as he had some traction heading into the 2022 usfl draft and has also seen some xfl interest as wellwhy not go find a tackle that can double as a nose tackle add some more girth to this defensive line allowing the linebackers to flow more freely sideline to sideline and make the tackles in the run game regardless something needs to be done sooner rather than laterpredictionstars 2418 while i expect the stars to have to make adjustments to slow down this horton defense their offense should be no tall task for this stars defense even with the injuries on that side of the ball pittsburgh has scored 18 points and all of them can be attributed to special teams or defense with two field goals one punt return for a touchdown and a scoop and score this offense might be the worst unit in my 20 years of watching professional footballmy biggest curiosity with this game will be attendance i love that ford field is a venue for the usfl and im hoping the panthers see solid support at home but im doubting they find many ways to get fans in the stands for the stars game unfortunately that is the unfortunate downside to only having four hubs it would be interesting to compare the cost the xfl incurred in stadiums and travel in their single hub8 stadium model versus the cost of the usfl model after all the usfl champions a longterm approach and a budgetconscious business model to achieve this goaloverview of week threeso far the maulers offense has looked stagnant and the defense allowed over 300 yards passing in week one once the breakers figured out their pass rush and prevented further pressure in mcleod bethelthompsons face if this game comes down to stopping a pass rush my concerns with this offensive line are valid to say the least so far through two games we have seen their fair share of sacks and pressures allowed with case cookus paying the price albeit not all of them are their entirely their faultif the stars want case cookus to play in 12 games like he mentioned in our recent interview they need to be able to protect him better even if they take half the blame at this rate this still amounts to a ton of hits on cookus im fairly certain that andrus and company arent looking to repeat the number of players that lined up at quarterback in 2022 3more concerning than our protection of case cookus has been our venerability in the run game an issue the stars went about trying to correct by bringing in tyler clark and jordan scott while bringing back chris nelson nelson and clark have been injured and scott finally was active in week 2 however we still have seen issues in this area i wonder how much of this has to do with the continued absence of jordan moore who led the team in tackles at the linebacker spot last season as well and jordan genmarkheath as well the depth on defense

comment1 commentken granitoapril 30 2023 at 203 pmwatching the stars vs maulers it would seem to me that now that the nfl draft is now done the stars may want ti discuss signing one of their draftees that did not get drafted by the nfl hopefully one that can pull after the breakers show what you can do when you can pull and run outside stars run every run up the middle and they wonder why they have more runs for loss than a 5 yard gain as far as the maulers go troy williams is again so very inconsistent we are at spot now that maybe they talk with their 1 draft pick if he wont sign we can understand that 74 was taken out by the maulers he was lost out there terry poole was a damn good signing i am glad coach horton is giving troy williams a chance but starting to feel he is not the

elusive win on their own turf detroit has yet to see their hometown team claim victory at ford field but against a struggling pittsburgh team saturday 1230 pm et week 5 could be the weekthe panthers sit at the bottom of fox sports usfl power rankings and after starting the season strong need to find their groove again while pittsburgh is also coming off a loss it was by a more narrow margin and the maulers have shown flashes of potentialit will be interesting to see how things shake out when the teams meet on sunday at noon etcan the generals generate enough offense to get back in the win columnnew jersey linebacker chris orr is tied for the league lead in tackles with 103 per game leading a defense that has allowed fewer points than any other in the usfl they held the best team in the league the undefeated breakers to 20 points last weekthis is all well and good but what new jersey needs in order to get above 500 is some offense the generals simply arent scoring enough points they managed a seasonhigh 28 against the struggling michigan panthers in week 3 but havent managed more than 20 points in any other gamenew jersey is rushing for a leaguebest 1693 yards per game thanks to running back darius victor who ranks second in rushing yards through five weeks he has 290 on 41 carries this season including two for touchdowns against a philadelphia stars team that gave up 225 yards on the ground last weekend new jersey will have a real opportunity to put some points on the board with yards on the groundcan cookus and the stars get back on trackthe stars came into the season riding the momentum of yet another championship appearance in 2022 had it not been for an injury to quarterback case cookus in the fourth quarter they could very well be boasting the title of defending champions this seasonbut they arent cookus and the offense dont seem to be in rhythm at all because of that cookus seems out of sorts holding the ball too long and forcing throws that have led him  and the team  into precarious situations cookus took six sacks last week against the houston gamblers he threw an interception too in all the stars turned the ball over twice and scored just 16 points to houstons 41the stars also couldnt stop houston running back mark thompson who rushed for three touchdowns on the day in total going up against a new jersey team that is averaging the most rushing yards per game this season the stars are going to need something to click and fast they are hanging out in the power rankings cellar with their fellow hub team the michigan panthers with both teams still searching for their first win at home by carmen vitalimemphis showboats 13 vs new orleans breakers 40sunday 3 pm et on fox and the fox sports appthe new orleans breakers 40 are the last unbeaten team in the usfl and coach john defilippo doesnt want to call it a bulls eye on his team but he understands theyre getting everyones best game until theyre knocked off that perchi dont call it the bulls eye i just say were the hunted defilippo said he prepares his breakers for a game in birmingham against the memphis showboats 13 sunday 3 pm et on fox and the fox sports app there are certain things that come with being the hunted youre getting everyones best shot id rather be 40 than 04 theres a responsibility that comes with being the hunted your attention to detail the way you practice all of that has to be on pointnew orleans has the league leaders in passing and rushing yards with quarterback mcleod bethelthompson passing for 1116 yards and six touchdowns while throwing only two interceptions lowest among the leagues starting quarterbacks running back wes hills has been the leagues top rusher both with 389 rushing yards and eight touchdowns on the groundthats what good teams do  they complement each other defilippo said there are some games youll win 2017 and some games youll win 4948 and thats ok the bottom line is having one more point than the other team  im pleasantly surprised the way we can run the footballon the other end of sundays matchup is memphis which just secured its first win of the season last week pulling out a 2910 win over the michigan panthers theyre allowing the most yards in the league and are tied for the most points allowed with 109 in four games but last weeks win was a muchneeded step in the right direction punctuated with a defensive touchdown to seal the winwe needed it desperately and now the key is start stacking wins said memphis coach todd haley pleased to see his defense step up with three takeaways after totaling one in their first three games we created pressure and finally the ball came to us or we made it come to us sometimes when youre working so hard to get turnovers and theyre not coming you finally get those first couple and it opens the floodgates a little bit guys start gaining confidence and they just start feeding off each othermemphis has gotten improved play from quarterback cole kelley and after losing former seahawks running back alex collins to injury they got a spark from kerrith whyte who had been among their final cuts but compiled 54 yards rushing and had another 27 receiving in the win against michigan that defense will have quite a challenge in keeping the breakers in checkits a great challenge haley said their quarterback is the most experienced quarterback in the league and it shows hes very efficient theyve got a good running back and theyre obviously being coached well were going to have to make the quarterback uncomfortable and we cant allow him to keep completing balls at a 70percent clip hell pick you apart so we have to find ways to get our hands on the football someway and somehow by greg aumancarmen vitali covers the nfc north for fox sports carmen had

between the new orleans breakers and the memphis showboats there are several key storylines emerging on both sides that are sure to make this game a thrilling spectaclefor the breakers all eyes will be on the dynamic offensive duo of quarterback mcleod bethelthompson and tight end sage surratt the synergy between these two players coupled with the forceful running from wes hills has been a major driving force behind the breakers recent successes bethelthompson coming off a commendable performance against the generals where he completed 26 of 37 passes for 273 yards will undoubtedly be looking to eliminate the interceptions from his gameon the other hand concerns remain around the recovery of greg eisworth whose significant role in the breakers defense cannot be understated the breakers focus in the runup to the week 5 game will be on maintaining their momentum and sharpening their offensive drives while ensuring better clock managementturning to the memphis showboats the team will be coming into the game on a high having secured their first win in week 4 against the panthers the showboats head coach todd haley has shown his tactical prowess and his audacious fourthquarter decision in the previous game was instrumental in their victorythe showboats offense led by the dynamic partnership between quarterback cole kelley and vinny papale will be crucial in taking on the breakers their previous win showcased their strong connection and replicating this success will be key not to be overlooked is the showboats defense with linebacker jeff mccollough at the helm which

incident during the last game new orleans breakers leading tackler safety greg eisworth ii sustained an injury that led to his removal from the field the incident occurred early in the second half when eisworth was involved in a tackle on victoreisworth seemed to take a knee to the head during the tackle which required immediate attention from the teams medical staff he was carefully attended to on the field then helped up and transported off the field on a cart however he remained alert and was sitting upright throughout the processaccording to john defilippo the breakers head coach eisworth has been medically cleared and is moving all of his extremities defilippo was on the field when eisworth managed to sit up on his own a positive sign for all concernedwhile he was unable to provide specific medical details defilippo expressed optimism about eisworths condition he mentioned that the team doctors are very positive that eisworth will recover fully from the injury the teams thoughts are with eisworth during this time and they look forward to his swift and safe recoverybreaking evenas the memphis showboats with a sevenpoint spread gear up to face the undefeated new orleans breakers the betting stakes are high the current overunder is set at 475 a number that has captured my attention for this upcoming clashthe new orleans breakers with an impressive undefeated 40 record are entering this game as the leagues topscoring team averaging a formidable 3125 points per game this offensive prowess is largely credited to their quarterback mcleod bethalthompson in his inaugural usfl year bethalthompson is leading in both passing yards and touchdowntointerception ratio the breakers offense has consistently put up a minimum of 20 points in every game so far and theres a high probability they could easily break into the 30point range in this matchconversely the memphis showboats defense has struggled conceding more yards per game than any other team in the usfl they previously allowed a staggering 42 points against a birmingham offense similar to the breakersnevertheless its essential to mention that the showboats will be riding the high of their first season win against michigan this victory may provide a confidence boost but theyll need more than selfassurance to counter the breakers formidable offensegiven these factors a highscoring game seems likely potentially becoming lopsided in the breakers favor quite quickly my betting analysis indicates a lean towards new orleans and the over preferred bet over 475waves in action  pictwittercomk8scgcekll new orleans breakers usflbreakers may 12 2023predictionlooking ahead to week 5 we are set for an intriguing clash between the formidable new orleans breakers and the resurgent memphis showboats despite the disparity in their records both teams have shown signs of brilliance that make this matchup one to watchwith a flawless record of 40 the breakers are unquestionably the team to beat this season they have been consistently powerful demonstrating both offensive and defensive prowess that has left their opponents reeling if they manage to clinch a victory in week 5

showboats with a record of 13 are coming into this game off the back of their first win in week 4 against the panthers this victory thanks to a bold fourthquarter decision by their head coach todd haley has given them a momentum that they will be eager to capitalize onthe showboats offense led by quarterback cole kelley and vinny papale proved to be a formidable duo in their previous win their chemistry and connection on the field will need to be on full display to counter the breakers strong defense furthermore the showboats defense spearheaded by linebacker jeff mccollough will need to step up and limit the breakers highpowered offenseas we approach the faceoff predictions start to take shape the breakers based on their impressive form are the clear favorites however the showboats

weeks expect them to turn to a heavy dose of reggie corbin and stevie scott iii to make up for an ineffective passing attack stemming from issues at quarterback while i do think michigan has trouble stopping the dynamic playmaking ability of troy williams on the ground i do think the maulers continue to struggle punching it in and settle for field goals instead of touchdowns once again because of

demographicthe final usfl game of the weekend pitting the houston gamblers and new jersey generals averaged 630000 viewers at 4 pm et on foxthe usfls week 6 games averaged 451500 viewersusfl rating analysisnot a great week for the league in terms of overall viewershipas evidenced over time theres been a clear difference and decline between cable and overtheair network television games a year ago at this time the usfl averaged 731000 viewers in week 6 but that came from having three network games rather than twothe sporting calendar is about to clear up with the nba and nhl wrapping up their playoffs so that could help the usfl draw in more eyeballs and attention in the coming weeksthe issue right now is the usfls performance thus far on network television the league has had only one out of 16 broadcast network games in six weeks that have averaged over a million viewers their impressive 2063 million performance a few weeks ago on nbc primetime the derby leadin surely played a part in what is a brilliant strategy by usfl executives in trying to lure in new and casual viewersits safe to say that the league is in a midseason lull for interest but with all eight teams separated by only one game in the standings there should be plenty of games in the remaining four weeks of the regular season that have heightened stakes and playoff importanceweek 7s slate of usfl games will have only one overtheair network game with three cable telecasts the only time you will see that this season there will be two cable telecasts in week 10 however of the usfls remaining 16 regular season games ten will air on nbc or fox which should help boost the overall numbersweek 7 usfl tv schedulesaturday may 27birmingham at new orleans birmingham 4 pm foxphiladelphia at pittsburgh canton 9 pm

might not get to see any there are lots of cool things to do in the spring i really like the idea of having two more teams next year and having monday night footballreply4thlongmay 23 2023 at 1039 pmgood analysis mikethe cable games likely under performed by 5080k each the sunday broadcastgame was going against great ne weather and while i was hoping for 700750k the 632k they got was not unexpectedhowever with the ne having a crappy weather day saturday the 732k fox game was disappointing having the last hour overlap the preakness should have been avoidedall that said cable was about 60k avg below wk 6 2022 the daytime broadcast games were down 45k on avg and the big difference was 2022 had a primetime game that was on the stronger nbc and got 1196kironically i have xfl and usfl at 652653k thru 6 week respectively hows that for another sping league parallelthe bad and good coming up week 7 as you stated is on an summer unofficial holiday we and only 14 games on broadcast but weeks 8championship has only 3 cable and includes 5nbc with 2 primetime 7fox with 3 primetime and should occur after nhlnba playoffs are wrapped up of course the tv football pie shrinks as we move deeper into spring and then summerand how about those starsreplymike mitchellmay 27 2023 at 1155 amthe usflxfl comparison after six weeks of play is interesting in terms of ratingsthe usfl should have a much more higher average with 16 over the network games on nbcfox the picture gets even more murkier for the usfl if you take out the 2 million viewer derby lead in gameat this point after six weeks the xfl has had better ratings replyken granitomay 27 2023 at 1118 amnice the usually brief and to the point 4th  long expanding on an article i love it you have lots of good thoughts share them more this rockedreplyken granitomay 28 2023 at 1206 pmi have no belief that i know more than the people running the league and i dont know what headwinds the league would be up against it seems to me we are talking ratings that are below what we feel they should be i know it seems that adding two more teams it would only water down ratings even more on a per game basis but please read onright now we are only in less than half the united states san diego needs a team in year 3 first they have a really nice stadium in snap dragon the way you increase ratings is to make your product relevant to people in the rest of the country san diego is a great fit the nfl felt it was a good place a team and i am sure they were supported there until the nfl became so big that an upgrade was needed there should be more than enough interest for a league that average 12k fans per contest since the climate is pretty much the same all year few people will say ahh i cant watch football its such a nice day because they all are nice daysall year round if you can work denver into the mix we now have teams across the country this will also show we are a league built in tradition but also forward thinking as well we could then have games on mondayfriday if needed night allowing for the teams that play in warmer climes to have night games and to also open up new possible tv audiences think you have doubled the area of the leagues reach and now have opened up people who like football but havent watched due to spring family obligations can now watch so you may have added clients and maybe they pick up on a team and now they watch a weekend game as well same thing with the west coast fans you pick up i know this may cost maybe its time to sell the generals to derek jeter he got out of the marlins because the other team officials and he had a differing of opinions you can work the numbers with him but say he bought the generals for 15million he could make all the decisions that you havent added to the league rules and you would not have to worry about placing them in jersey something that hasnt really come to easy for the league so far maybe they could charge 15 25 and 40 per ticket just some things to think about i would not other teams couldnt work but i would definitely start with san diegoreplyken granitomay 28 2023 at 1213 pmit may be all pipedreams but you have to

showcased its ability to stop one of the leagues best scoring offenses  and a playoff team a year ago  in a 1710 win against the new orleans breakers as i wrote in my week 5 usfl power rankings the breakers walked into their home hub stadium in birmingham leading the usfl in total offense and tied for first in the usfl in scoring memphis defense held the breakers to just 10 pointssafety troy warner led this outstanding display of defense with 12 tackles other players on that defense to watch this week are big kat bryant and greg reavesif the showboats get another 200yard passing performance without a turnover from their offense theyll present an impressive challenge to the maulers who have shown themselves capable of playing the kind of defense that could propel them into the playoffslast week the maulers dispatched north division rival michigan 237 doubling their seasonlong win total from one year agothat effort was helped by an offensive performance fromquarterback williams who earned usfl offensive player of the week honors after putting up243 of the maulers 299 total yards he completed 15 of 19 passes for 184 yards with 59 rush yards and three total tds in their winthe maulers managed to score the most points they had all season in the win by capitalizing in the red zone prior to week 5 the maulers converted just one of 12 red zone attempts into a td against the panthers though pittsburgh converted three of four red zone trips into tdsthat trend will likely need to continue against a showboats team that has allowed just 10 points in each of their

last three theyve slipped to third in fox sports usfl power rankings but with the new orleans breakers losing their first game last weekend the south remains wide open camp he was one of the running backs that i looked at that just said ok why is this guy not in the nfl interview with gamblers running back mark thompson rj young talks to houston gamblers rb mark thompson as they delve into his remarkable success in the usfl and he shares his aspirations for the future there were also some offfield issues johnston and the usfl though recognize there are those that deserve second chances chances to show maturity good citizenship community engagement and to showcase their ability as football playersin fact 2022 usfl mvp kavontae turpin was such a player the usfl took a chance on seven months after the new jersey generals first signed turpin the cowboys invited him to training camp his ability as a punt and kick returner led the cowboys to sign him to their 53man roster by the end of the 2022 season he had been named a pro bowler and an nfl allpro by his peersjohnston called turpins story unbelievableyou know thats what the hook is here in this league johnston said giving these young men another opportunity sometimes its a nontraditional path back to the nfl sometimes its just changing the narrative thats out there about you sometimes its just showcasing your skill setthompson now 28 was held back by injuries in 2022 though when he is healthy he is the usfls closest comparison to derrick henry at 6foot3 235 pounds its not uncommon to see thompson running by

taking the days as they come grateful to play pro football and looking to put together a complete seasonon may 16 2023 i asked to talk to thompson againi feel like last year there was a lot of hype going into the season he said and those first few games i was definitely doing what i needed to do to showcase my talent but i didnt have a strong finish and overall the team didnt do well and if the team doesnt do well everyones not gonna get looks when we all play well were all gonna get looked at so i think i just need to keep playing the way im playing i have to do the little things righthe is hes playing with fury on the field remaining focused humble and teamoriented on it in that way hes showing himself to be the man johnston sought out personallyi reached out to him and spoke to him directly johnston told me this is somebody whos learned from his mistakes knows that hes missed an opportunity and knows that the clock is running on him im excited to see what mark thompson does with this opportunity because i think hes one of those guys that knows that theres not a lot of time left for him and if hes going to have that opportunity to get to the nfl level hes got to have a breakout season in the usfl and when you watch him on film he is fully capable of doing thatthe usfl isnt just a spring football league its the way back and thompson is walking it by rj youngcarmen

of quarterback deandre johnson darius victor and trey williams on sunday afternoon philadelphia is coming off a game where they allowed 219 yards rushing to the houston gamblershowever the area that also favors new jersey over philly significantly in week 5 is the generals improved pass rush under defensive coordinator ted cotrell against the stars porous offensive linea year ago despite having one of the leagues best defenses new jersey only mustered up ten sacks during the 2022 regular season in 2023 the generals surpassed that paltry number through four weeks cotrells defense leads the

draft resultsfantasyplay fantasyscoresphiladelphia starsphiladelphia stars week 6 preview betting odds depth chartbysam justmay 20 2023the philadelphia stars collect their second victory on the season however the offense didnt score a touchdown on the day instead relying on luis aguilars 8 field goals on the day a usfl record thats right the stars scored 24 points and every single point came from the kicking game a kicking game that had looked rough early onthis weeks player of the game for the stars has to be luis aguilar the former northern arizona lumberjack just kept chopping the kicks right down the middle all game long after beginning this season 13 on field goals and 4 of 5 on extra points aguilar hasnt missed a kick since an astounding 11 for 11 on field goals and 2 for 2 on extra points not only was aguilar 8 of 8 on field goals accounting for every point the stars scored but the marathon man also punted 3 times for an average of 40 yards he also kicked off 9 times in this game thats an amazing 20 kicks in a single game give that man his flowers never has a kicker been more valuable than this gameluis the leg congrats on setting a new professional football record for most combined fg yardage  luisaguilar124 pictwittercom2mdptz0xua philadelphia stars usflstars may 18 2023the stars defense forced not one not two but three darius victor fumbles on the day victor touched the ball 14 times fumbling three times or an average of once ever 5 touches a defensive unit that didnt record a single sack yet again managed to make big plays by taking the ball away with 3 fumbles recovered and a mazzi wilkins interception these 4 turnovers were the difference in the game leading directly to 9 of the 24 points the stars scored in fact the short field given to the stars offense on four occasions might have been the only reason we see the stars come out of this game with a winin an attempt to capitalize on those turnovers the stars scored on 3 of 4 drives created by turnovers the offense however produced just 52 yards on these four drives on 24 plays an average of 21 yards per play ran this can not continue if the stars want to continue winning luis aguilar might be the best kicker in the usfl but that doesnt mean you can expect him to go 8 for 8 every week and be the sole point production for your teamthe good the bad the uglythe goodcase cookus continued to do exactly what we have come to expect from cookus he protected the ball and continued his efficient completion rate of over 60 he also added 4 key carries for 21 yards this amounted to 13 of the stars rushing production on the day another product of the disastrous play by this offensive line even with former 3rd round pick for the patriots antonio garcia inserted at left tackle even with the changes up front the stars allowed 4 sacks ironically this has kept their average for the season at just over 4 sacks per game with a total of 23 through 4 weeksluis aguilar has been money in the bank since week three and his streak of success has peaked in scoring 24 points on the day and single handedly carrying his team to victory with 20 kicks on the day not often can you describe a kicker as an ironman but the description seems apt here aguilar has rebounded nicely after a tough start to the seasonwith 24 points sunday the week 5 special teams player of the week is usflstars kicker luisaguilar124  pictwittercomcqz4srny5r usfl usfl may 15 2023the kick off coverage unit has improved allowing just 23 yards per return on 9 kickoffs while i would like to see this average drop even more ill take the improvement where and when i can all around special teams has stepped up credit to coach martin bayless who has his unit playing near its peak right nowthe badthe pass rush failed to get home for the third game this season in three out of five games this defense has not logged a sack week 1 week 2 and now week 5 with the additions of darius hodge ali fayad and carson taylor i wasnt expecting the pass rush to be an issue yet here we are having produced just 6 sacks through 5 gamesi have mentioned using some 34 fronts to aid the run defense but this could also help produce more pressure rushing five but being able to disguise two rushers and not just one should make a significant difference i still think our defensive roster is built to run multiple fronts whether by design or coincidence guys like adam rodriguez carson taylor and ali fayad all look right at home playing linebackerquarterback runsyet again the defense proved susceptible to the quarterback run game this week the generals decided to split time between deandre johnson and kyle lauletta johnson attempted 12 passes and ran 7 times on those 7 carries he had 62 yards and 1 touchdown lauletta added 1 carry for 1 yard and 1 touchdown as welllast week it was terry wilson running 9 times for 49 yards in week three it was troy williams with 7 carries for 65 yards the first two weeks of the season we faced less mobile quarterbacks in brady white with memphis and the dynamic duo of josh love and carson strong in week 2even facing players not regarded as run first ask questions later type quarterbacks we saw how vulnerable we are to quarterbacks running the ball in week 1 brady white managed 4 carries for 29 yards over 7 yards per carry the stars have allowed an average of 64 yards per carry to quarterbackslack of a run gamethrough five weeks the stars rank as the worst rushing offense in the league theyre the only team that hasnt run the ball over 100 times they average the least rushing attempts per game and its a large gap between them and the league leaders in rushing attempts the stars average 182 attempts per game houston leads the league with 29 attempts per gamethe stars have collected just 262 rushing yards in five games they are a full 47 yards away from 7th place which the generals producing nearly four times as many rushing yards at 841 not only do the stars average less attempts and less yards each game but they also have the worst per carry average in the league at 29 yards per carrythe issue here isnt talent as both matt colburn and dexter williams were picked up by nfl teams this offseason colburn with the jaguars and williams with the packers however with the state of our offensive line neither player has had any running room last season the stars had one of the better offenses in the league this season we are lucky just to weather our way through games without giving up 5 sacks and averaging just 1 yard per carry this is by far the worst regression of any team when compared with the 2022 season the stars are less than one year removed from a 3 point loss in the championship game and at times have looked like the worst team in the leaguethe uglythe stars came into this game struggling to stop the run they came out of this game having allowed the league leading rushing team to top 800 yards in just week 5 the stars allowed 164 yards and 2 touchdowns on 29 carries for the generals ranked as the top rushing offense in the league they actually fell about 5 yards short of their per game averagethrough five games the stars have allowed 759 yards rushing or an average of 1518 yards per game they have also allowed 9 rushing touchdowns while the quarterback run has produced by far the most yards per carry the run defense in general needs to improve drastically if this winning is to continue for the stars we can not allow an average of 150 yards per game and expect to win games especially in the playoffs to put that into perspective only the generals have averaged more rushing yards on offense than the stars allow on average so if youre in a weekly redraft fantasy league take whichever starting back faces the starsinjury reportin backtoback weeks the stars have lost prominent offensive contributors last week it was chris rowland this week its jordan suell after the injury to suell in week 5 we saw more of diondre overton and samuel akem which i expect to continue regardless the injuries are piling up for the stars and things could get worse before they get better as evidence of thisfree agent signingog

2023transferred player to injured reserve listcb mazzi wilkinsreleasedot colby ragland philadelphia stars usflstars may 19 2023i wouldnt be surprised to see more of terry wright involved on offense as well he is your best bet for replacing the role chris rowland held so far this season as much as i want to see coleman involved in the run game using wright in this manner makes a bit more sense at this point due to the injuries out wide with darnell holland still not ready to return the stars are gambling that their depth can get them through the next few games without losing anyone else any more injuries at running back or wide receiver and the stars will have to bring someone in perhaps charles headen a wrkr from the frisco fighters of the indoor football league makes senseheaden has 22 kick returns for 468 yards and 2 touchdowns on the year 2 carries for 10 yards and 3 receptions for 31 yards he played his college ball at shippensburg and southern methodist university at the xfl showcases last season he ran a 442 40 yard dash displaying his open field speed not only does he handle return duties but the former high school sprinter and defensive back is also a special teams ace on coverage units maximizing his value as a depth piece at this level the 510 190 pound wideout also happens to be a philadelphia native which would make for a good story and help to build a fan base in their host citythe stars also brought in lirim hajrulluha to be prepared for fatigue from last weeks game and potentially lessen his loadfree agent signingk lirim hajrullahu western

charti am surprised to see them throw keith into the lineup immediately even as a depth piece he will be active this week and is our sole backup on the right side of the line with jacob burton starting at right tackle and airon servais at right guard its possible one of these guys is keiths backup next week as he slides in as the starter at right guardas expected with suell going down we see overton penciled in as a starter with keric wheatfall and samuel akem as depth pieces this weekthe choices at linebacker are interesting bj bello is currently your backup at inside linebacker and outside linebacker behind joey alfieri and joel dublanko respectively then you have gabriel sewell jr as your other outside linebacker and joel dublanko penciled in as your backupat defensive line we are also looking somewhat thin with keyshon camp as the backup at both end positions with carson taylor and adam rodriguez as the starters labryan ray gets the start at defensive tackle just 3 months removed from being on the roster of the patriots jordan scott is your other starter with chris nelson and tyler clark the backups this might be the most encouraged i have been in a while about our interior lineit appears that lirim hajrullahu will now handle punting duties going forward these depth charts dont list kickoff specialist but i believe he will handle kickoffs as well hajrullahu has 651 career punts with the cfl this is a very smart move if the stars are going to get back on track playing the field position game is very important luis aguilar is an amazing kicker but he has never been a great punter he has 42 punts for 1606 yards and a 382 yard average in college he punted just 20 times and averaged 352 yards per punt hajrullahu has a career average of 441 yards per punt that extra 6 yards of field position could make for a big difference for this defense over the course of a game with the stars averaging 4 punts per game we are talking about another 24 yards per gameweek six previewheading into week six the stars are coming off of a victory that really didnt settle any stomachs sick from watching case cookus sacked 19 times heading into this game or from a run game struggling to move the ball scoring 24 points was a step in the right direction the fact that it took eight field goals and four turnovers to get there isnt promising whats more concerning is youre about to face the top passing offense in the league coming off your third game without a sack this must change if the stars want to bring home the win in this gamethe breakers have averaged over 245 passing yards and 108 rushing yards per game this season meanwhile the stars are 5th in passing offense per game with 184 yards per game but last in rush offense with only 52 yards per game this could prove to be the toughest test so far this season for this defense i dont care what league you play in averaging over 350 yards of offense per game is impressive but to also have the best kick return average in the league with just over 28 yards per return it paints the picture of a team firing on all cylinderson defense the breakers are 5th in points allowed with 206 per game while the stars are ranked 7th allowing 244 points per game the breakers also have produced twice as many sacks than the stars on the year with 12 while also ranking third in turnovers forced the breakers defense is also ranked 3rd in stopping the run although i would venture a guess game flow plays a part in this with new orleans often in the lead regardless i dont believe this will be the week we see matt colburn return to his 2022 formon paper this should be a blow out victory for the breakers to be fair this is exactly how i viewed the generals game the leagues best rush offense versus the leagues worst rush defenseyet the stars kicked their way to victory via four turnovers if the defense can again force multiple turnovers maybe the stars have a better chance in this game than most believe also one little talked about fact is that the breakers have allowed 10 sacks so far this season and at times their tackles have looked like revolving doors while i dont see our run game getting back on track i do look for our pass rush to rebound and put up at least two sacks if the stars can keep pressure on mcleod bethelthompson and force an errant pass or two it could turn the tide in this one quicklymy prediction stars 21breakers 27betting oddsi had voiced my concerns about the spread for this last game saying i was surprised it sat at only 5 points in my opinion it should have been higher and my opinion was reflected by the bettors who ran the spread to 7 points by game day the stars not only covered but they also helped hit the overat the time of writing this the spread per draftkingscom site at 6 for philadelphia this is spot on in my opinion while i think the game could get out of hand if the stars struggle to produce pressure on mbt i expect them to be within one score of victory by the end of the game the overunder for the game is currently 44 points if i was a betting man im taking philadelphia to cover and the over best of luck this week to all you gamblers out there all

first hardcopy card i was very disappointed and disturbed to find out that on top of the 595 charge for 1 card there is also a 524 shipping i understand the concept of trying to keep production costs low finding out how many cards they would need to produce before overproduction but i am extremely disturbed to see this doublealmost triple dipping first they save money on the production side as they wait to see how many cards they need to produce then they charge an exorbitant amount either 595 for game day moments or 995 for a pack of 3 at these prices they should clearly include shipping even their directions say that you can have them shipped but do not indicate at a charge when i tried to have 1 card shipped to me they tried to charge 524 somehow ebays shipppng rates are much better i am going to see if a more complete set will be more cost effective either way the usfl season has been over for most teams for a month now we still dont have our cards that we overpaid for and we are being charged ransom for our held cards lower dck is surely a greedy scam just looking to fill its pockets i hope darryl johnston and the usfl looks at this to see how this can be rectified going forward lord knows i have bought my last card directly through that awful card companyreplyken granitojuly 21 2023 at 923 amas a follow up to the usfl football card scam they indicated we would have our cards in 812 weeks it is now passed that and only one card is available i made my purchases on april 23rd that means they are already past their latest timetable mark can you please reach out to the usfl to see if there is anything they can do about it right now it seems to me they are putting out one card at a time to maximize shipping profits as if they havent already made much more than the worth of the products if you feel the same please add to the comments so as to show this is not acceptable and that upper deck did a poor job of adding to the credibility of the league maybe there

on nbcseason 2 of the revived usfl has seen a new cast of players take the league by storm while other standouts from 2022 have either duplicated or elevated their play from last seasonafter countless viewings of every single usfl game this season here is my 2023 allusfl team along with players who just missed the cut but deserve honorable mention the league itself will be putting out its own official list in the futurein the past as ludicrous as it sounds offensive linemen have been ignored by some usfl experts when doing an allleague list perhaps thats an anomaly but the one position that is typically cast aside and not mentioned is the long snapper so for the sake of this i am breaking from tradition and starting with special teams first followed by defense offense and coach of the yearallusfl 2023 team2023 allusfl special teamsk matt coghlin new orleans breakersp brock miller new jersey generalsls turner bernard new orleans breakerskr derrick dillon memphis

ls riley lovingood pittsburgh maulers ls ryan navarro philadelphia starsone of the strongest positions in the usfl in 2023 has been the kicker spot five of the leagues eight starting placekickers connected on 88 percent of their field goals or higher four are over 90 percentmatt coghlin might not have gotten the headlines that luis aguilar did thanks to an outofthisworld eightfield goal performance in week 5 but coghlin was nearly perfect he missed one kick all season 94 percent conversion rate on field goals and without a blemish on extra pointslong snappers are only noticed when something goes awry anytime you have a kicking game that nears perfection over ten games the hidden mvp in that operation is always the player snapping the football the breakers turner bernard along with several of his peers in the usfl deserve nfl lookspunter is also strong position throughout the usfl any of the names listed here could easily get the nod to me i tend to look at the performance of punters that were put in the most adverse situations over the course of a season due to their teams offensive strugglesthe generals brock miller not only led the league in the percentage of punts and kicks inside the 20 but had impeccable hang time although miller ranked highly in all punting categories the stat sheet doesnt always tell the whole storynormally a player with two kick returns for touchdowns like deon cain would get the spot at kick returner but derrick dillon also had two returns for touchdowns this season however one came on a missed field goal the one in this equation however is one of the best football plays you will ever see from a return man a 109yard td return where he not only fields the football perfectly but manages to stay in bounds during the process and oh yeah then returns it 109 yards only three players in nfl history have accomplished that feat dillon joined them this year he also averaged 328 yards per kick return this season best of the qualified bunchmaybe the play of the year so far in the usflderrick dillon keeps his balance stays in bound while catching the short field goal and returns it 109 yards to the house to end the first half once again showboats are rolling pictwittercombaimslrauf matt infield matt_infield may 20 2023the twoheaded maulers tandem of josh simmons and isiah hennie could easily get top billing without

khalan tolson houston gamblers gabriel sewell jr philadelphia stars shaheed salmon new orleans breakerspound for pound linebacker might be the most talented position in the usfl this season especially at the top end the fact that rueben foster has earned an honorable mention rather than firstteam after having a great comeback season in the pros tells you all you need to knowmany who follow the league will also place stallions lb quentin poling as a surefire allstar while his numbers do not compare to other players in his category in terms of overall tackles sacks forced turnovers etc theres no denying the fact that poling stood out bigtime this season helping replace two productive players on that defense in scooby wright and demarquis gateskyahva tezino should be an nfl linebacker he shouldnt play another snap in the usfl after this season it would be a crime if he did the knock on him coming out was his physical traits tezino is a genuine everydown linebacker who can play in the trenches or make plays deep in coverage hes as smart as any defender in the usfl just watch the tapewhat a season frank ginda had hes been playing spring pro football at a top level for a long time now but he raised his game to another level this year gindas instincts and effort level stand out on filmvontae diggs and chris orr have been playmakers all over the field for their respective

terrific seasons in coverage there are several players at cornerback who played at a very high level this seasonallusfl 2023 team offensequarterback alex mcgough birmingham stallionshonorable mention case cookus philadelphia stars mcleod bethelthompson new orleans breakersalthough mcleod bethelthompson has led the league in passing yards all season the leagues best quarterback and arguably best player in 2023 has been alex mcgough it would be shocking if he isnt anointed league mvpalex mcgough has improved leaps and bounds from the player he was in 2022 he has evolved as a quarterback a year ago mcgough started three games played in seven and completed 52 percent of his passes for birmingham with three interceptions to go along with three touchdownsin 2023 mcgough has completed 67 percent of his passes amassing over 2500 yards and 20 touchdowns through the air and on the ground combined he has helped lead birmingham to the playoffs as the favorite to win it all againmbt deserves credit for what he did on his journey back home from the cfl he seamlessly made the transition back to the american game and displayed great leadershipall things considered case cookus had an amazing season he stood up to a lot of abuse during the season being sacked and hit more than any other starter in the usfl somehow he made it to week 10 in one piecerunning back mark thompson houston

out from the packte sage surratt new orleans breakersjace sternberger birmingham stallionshonorable mention cole hikutini michigan panthersperhaps theres a bit of rulebending involved in listing two tight ends but in usfl 2023 it feels appropriate to make that exceptionsage surratt and jace sternberger were two topten receivers in the entire league week to week they took turns leading the usfl in receiving yards and touchdowns you could argue that surratt and sternberger were two of the top three receivers in the entire league periodas the season progressed cole hikutini rose to the forefront

my one exception is gm no one wanted to come to houston no hc half the defense left they did not noticeably upgrade the qb position yet the gamblers were competitive this year the line was built and that would be how the get better it worked so well they were good enough to release terrone prescod who started for the showboats i know there were a ton of injuries for the stallions but many of those signing were known quantities as they were on the stallions last year now commenting i love darius victor the guy runs so hard that he must somehow forget what happens when 2 or 3 collide atl the speed these guys run but mark thompson really became the heart and soul of this offense kyahva tezino the very first time i saw him he intercepted a tipped ball and ran it all the way back to his mom in the bleachers kirby wilson must be very proud it didnt turn out for wilson the way hoped but i bet he is happy for tezino he said he wanted men tezino myst be exactly who he was hoping for chris orr was leading the league in tackles when he went down with injury and that is in a league with tezino and ginda literally the heart of the generals defense and a guy that just in last weeks winner take all between the maulers and generals garrett groshek goes over to orr after he was tackled put his arm out and picked up orr they both went to wisconsin so you might expect that but to cross that line on a football field there must be a great deal of mutual respect mcgough was everything the stallions needed this year he went from immature to being exactly what this team needed its actually the perfect blend of youth and maturity i hear people saying how he is like mahones to me this trait is what gives him that mahomes quality also they say landing planes on an aircraft carrier is organized chaos he plays in similar fashion last year corey coleman was a practice squad player on the chiefs i hope he enjoyed playing in the usfl and is back next year same for trey quinn lets hope marlon williams and jordan suell come back to being themselves too way to see brock millers talents beside the numbers he pins teams back so well another was dj daniel when the generals lost both starting cbs to the xfl they were going to need some help dj daniel was excellent the last thing i will like to talk about is the breakers wideoutssage surratt what talent they have at those positions they lost taywan taylor who had the legs to spread the defense which would leave many more openings for this group of talented pass catchers i cant even imagine how good the breakers would have been

amount of concern it should be very concerning to the league but you did not embellish the fact only 3 people have signed back with the usfl is disconcerting what the usfl has going for it is the experience and drive in the coaching staff and the fact that there are only so many positions in the new league that along with there being a certain amount of nfl academy will take away some of those positions as well it should be interesting to see where we stand come januaryreply4thlongnovember 21 2022 at 1059 ami think its unrealistic to think that one league will not lose players to the other league especially as fas  it happens in the nfl from team to team 18 players and maybe many more represents less than 5  of the roster size of all usfl teams and that excludes players cut or injured for the season so its way less than 5 the usfl likely made a mistake not signing 2 year contracts but with possible xfl on horizon it may have scared players from signingthe spring fb wars are on xfl may be opening checkbook more right now mostly for qbs but is it sustainable thats the big questionalso with xfl playing first it likely makes sense to sign with them as you can get money and even if cut can sign with usfl laterreplyken granitonovember 21 2022 at 519 pmagreed and since there are only 8 rosters to fill out in each league and a good number of players already remain unsigned hoping to be signed to an nfl roster there should be talent to go around it should also be interesting to see what happens with the cfl talent now that their season is over i wanted to see chad kelly signed

was not a great debut for the pittsburgh maulers they held a 19 record posted the secondworst rushing and passing offense and were bottom three in passing and rushing defense after a disastrous first season the maulers made significant changes to the coaching staff letting kirby wilson walk and hiring former super bowl champion ray horton theyve also overhauled their roster which can be outlined

of the steel city this weekend is an improvement it cant get too much worse than what happened last year one win simply isnt good enough if they want to be taken seriously in the usfllast year in this matchup the maulers took a 2616 loss to the breakers following their lone win of the season the week before things are very different out of pittsburgh though new uniforms new front office new coaching staff and most importantly new players quarterback james morgan will lead the charge of this offense replacing vlad lee and roland rivers iii meanwhile former nfl firstround pick linebacker

significantly and i think that theyll at the very least keep this game interestingeverything the maulers do they need to do better than before so itll be interesting to see how this team compares to the last out of the gate because its week one and were all learning about these teams as they go give me the upside on the maulers their offseason additions will work out beautifully and they take

millerapril 21 2023after starting the season with a loss to the michigan panthers the houston gamblers kick off week two of the usfl season by facing division rivals new orleans breakerslast week was a lot of the same houston gamblers team we saw last week as they got off to a good start leading 139 at halftime against the michigan panthers the bad part is like they did last season they blew a secondhalf lead that ended up resulting in a 2913 loss to the panthers pretty much the only reason for that is four of their five secondhalf possessions ended in turnovers two interceptions and two fumblesgoing into this week the team has made some changes to their roster as they got a major upgrade with the addition of wide receiver isaiah zuber returning more will be spoken about that big move as well as the news that running back mark thompson was moved up to the active roster this is in the hopes to create a spark in an offense that finished under 200 yards of total offense and 109 passing yards in the loss to michiganthey dont have the easiest opponent either this week as they face the new orleans breakers with new quarterback mcleod bethelthompson new orleans picked up a 2215

this weekend for the gamblers as they reported on friday that they will not have one of their starting offensive linemen tyler higby for this weekends game its a blow to an offensive line unit that is one of the most experienced in the usfl this will most likely mean that backup braylon jones could move up and start at left guard unless they decide to swap players around on the lineikenna onwuasoanya is the other player who is out for the gamblers as he is dealing with a knee injury onwauasoanya was listed as the backup defensive tackle leaving the team with just three on the depth chart its unknown what kind of moves they will make if it changes their scheme or moves players on the defensive line around like the offensive linekey players who showed up on the injury report include quarterback kenji bahar and safety manny bunch bahar is dealing with a right foot injury he will still play but it does bring an interesting scenario as to whether terry wilson gets to play more houston should be happy to see bunch be ready to play this weekend despite a left elbow injury as he is a key player to the defensegamblers signingsactive roster movestransferred player to active

2023looking at the active roster moves fans will be excited to see running back mark thompson back after he was one of the eight players on the inactive list last week thompson was the leading rusher for the team last season and top five in the usfl in rushing yards tj pledger took his place as the top rusher for houston last week leading the team in rushing yards while adding two touchdowns on the groundanother notable player who is active is defensive end tim bonner who will be a good sight to see as an intriguing prospect with onwuasoanyas injury it should open the door for bonner to get some reps this week in the game one other lineman to make note of is guard jair joseph who is directly linked to the higby injurythis article cant continue without discussing the zuber signing and what it means to the team he led the team in receiving yards and receiving touchdowns last season for houston while the return of zuber is impactful on the offense and on special teams its unclear whether they will play him this weekend it may not be a bad idea to have him play at least as a returner as the new rule changes to the kickoff could make him even more dangerousgamblersbreakers previewphoto via twitter usflgamblersgamblers head coach curtis johnson must see improvement from his quarterback bahar if they have any chance of being competitive there is a chance wilson will get more playing time as he got a few plays last week zubers signing should make the passing game better and give them a dynamic player to gain more yards than 23 yards for a receiverdefensively they have a major challenge in the secondary with breakers receiver jonathan adams and johnnie dixon being one of the bestreceiving duos in the usfl houston cornerback nick grant and jeremiah johnson will be tested early and often as new orleans is a passing team the gamblers will need help from their defensive line to get a good pass rush on bethelthompson to force bad passesthis game is going to be more challenging for houston as the gamblers have seen early issues on offense and defense houston needs to create early turnovers and score on one of their first two possessions if they have any shot of winning this game right now its hard to be optimistic about this team but if they put on a good showing that could go a long way in how the outcome of the season goesprediction new orleans breakers 28

much better for houston as running back tj pledger had just under 100 yards rushing and quarterback kenji bahar threw three touchdowns in the game even seeing receivers like justin hall and anthony ratliffwilliams step up was a major plus for the offense their ultimate downfall was the three interceptions bahar threw with two of them coming in the fourth quarterhoustons defense struggled to stop the run of the breakers with wes hills running for over 100 yards and multiple scores poor tackling and missed assignments were another big reason houston lost their game allowing 38 points in the

comes down to the defense and how much pressure they can get on brady white houston has recorded three sacks in two games so far this season so they need to get more production from their defensive

they need to take full advantage of it while they will still be playing in front of the memphis fanbase despite it being a home game for houston this is a get right game for the gamblers as long as

scored 142 and although their defense is second to last in points allowed the gamblers play on that side of the ball has also been a catalyst for their current winning streak the balanced play has

usflgamblers may 18 2023the generals defense led by ted cottrell is playing at a top level they are second in points allowed 87 only one point behind the maulers new jersey has particularly excelled defending the pass they lead the league in sacks with 16 and have allowed the fewest pass yards per contesthowever new jerseys offense has struggled this year despite leading the league in rushing at 168 yards per game they are not holding up their end of the bargainthe generals are seventh in the usfl in passing with only four touchdowns through the air after five games they are minus three in the turnover margin and are second to last in third down conversion rate 286 new jersey is facing a houston team that is tops in that department 545the generals have their work cut out for them in week 6 against the gamblerskeys to a new jersey generals victory in week 6the gamblers offense has taken a more conservative runheavy approach with quarterback kenji bahar out of their lineup but with bahar returning to the lineup after an ankle injury expect houston to open things back up in their passing gamekenji bahar had success moving the ball through the air in the first few weeks however he showed the propensity to turn the football over bahar leads the league in interceptions with six despite missing last weeks game the generals defense needs to force bahar into errors by getting houston into obvious passing situationsthe gamblers strength offensively is their overall balance they have been highly efficient in third and short situations slowing down potential league mvp mark thompson wont be easy but if new jersey can accomplish that they will make life tough on the returning baharthe two qb system which mike riley has employed since his time in the alliance of american football added a third head last week in veteran kyle lauletta minus throwing an interception lauletta had a decent outing against philly connecting on ten of twelve passes for 111 yards the generals need to find consistency every week at some point the teams game of musical chairs at quarterback must find its leaderfor what its worth lauletta is listed as the generals starter at qb this weekdeandre johnson who was banged up again last week is the generals most dynamic player when he is on his game johnson has to start making plays down the field with his arm to keep defenses honest there hasnt been a progression from johnson in that area this seasonnew jersey is sorely missing last years receiving standouts kavontae turpin and darrius shepherdthe team has always been run dominant under coordinator steven smith however the generals are not getting the same bang for their buck with big plays through the air as they did a season ago cam echolsluper and alonzo moore have had their moments but the generals front office dropped the ball this offseason in not bringing in differencemaking talent to replace their two departed starssomeone needs to step up in the generals passing attack the team can not survive only on a runcentric offense without some semblance of a threat through the air despite their recent improvements defensively the gamblers are still susceptible to the pass and new jersey needs to find a way to exploit that advantage in week 6usfl new jersey generalshouston gamblers week 6 predictionbecause of both teams elite rushing attacks the clever play here seems to be the under 455however the gamblers do have something the generals do not and thats explosive playmakers at wide receiver who can play significant roles in the pass and return game new jersey doesnt have dynamic talents like justin hall and anthony ratliffwilliams who are big plays waiting to happenbefore the season on paper this game looked like a cakewalk for new jersey mainly because of the gamblers deficiencies on defense primarily due to offseason losses on that side of their roster in the first few weeks houston looked like it would be a punching bag for opposing teams in that departmenthowever the tables have turned and the script has flipped houston looks like a team that is peaking on all fronts while new jersey appears to be stuck in neutralunless the generals defense carries the day i have a hard time putting trust into their offense and special teams two areas that have not been gamechangers to this point like they were a year agohouston is the better

commentsken granitomay 19 2023 at 948 pmthis was a pack full of information article i like usual agree with you that  believe this can be a tough game for jersey to win but to be honest no game should be easy and i am sure the breakers feel that after last week football is about putting your best product on the field and hoping its enough i am in agreement that the generals have not put their best product on the field as of yet i do feel that riley likes to kick the tires on his team to see what it has got deandre johnson deserved an opportunity to see what he could do just as dakota prukop deserved to get a chance last year riley settled on perez and the generals were 91 so its hard to argue with his results in the playoffs the generals were down 2 linemen and garrett mccginn played even though he was in a boot when darryl johnston came to generals practice and announced the awards in that video the risk in kicking the tires as he does is that if players get injured while tinkering you are literally out of the big games mike riley knows what he has the panthers dont because they much like the stars dont block well enough think of all the mistakes the generals made and the stars needed a record setting performance and 3 fumbles to win last year the generals methodically beat teams think they had enough offense last year to have the mvp the opoy and still had another rb that was 2nd in the league in rushing and another receiver with over 300 yards riley gave johnson the opportunity he deserved and to be honest he may still deserve another opportunity and he should remain in the game having some packages that johnson performs well but let lauletta have this week see if they can dominate top like they di d last year instead of big play or no points which is what has happened under johnson its great to have laulettas passing and the run game put a defense on its heals and have johnson pull out the big play with run or the play action pass if the generals stick together they are the best team in the north despite the maulers awesome d and the stars weapons the south will remain trouble just as houston will this week i do think however if the generals play their best they are as hard to beat as anyone go generalsreplyken granitomay 19 2023 at 1011 pmi guess i should have used the  but the gens have more stars than the starsreplyleave a replycancel

draft resultsfantasyplay fantasyscoresphiladelphia starsphiladelphia stars week 6 recap and week 7 previewbysam justmay 22 2023week 6 reviewin week six the stars were heading toward a matchup with the breakers who had been the best offense in the league to this point the breakers coming off of a loss to the memphis showboats in week 5 had shown they were not perfect and had room for improvement the stars may have won in week 5 but it came with the caveat that their kicker luis aguilar kicked 8yes 8 field goals to win the game by 3 on a last second kick this didnt silence the critics as the pass rush failed to get home and the offense couldnt find the endzone it looked like mcleod bethelthompson and the breakers were headed for a getright game against the stars defensei had already been having nightmares of watching anree saintamour and justus reed meeting at the quarterback as our tackles turn around and look dumbfounded at what just happened to them wes hills was surely in for a 100 yard day against our defense which couldnt to this point stop the run game and mbt was going to carve up the secondarysomeofthesethingsprovedtobetrueandsomeprovedtobefalsewhichweretheyandhowdidthestarsfareagainstthevauntedbreakersdiddavethewaverainonthestarsvictoryparadegamereviewthe stars were able to finally produce some pressure which helped result in an errant pass that resulted in the first touchdown of the day for the stars amani dennis jumped a route intercepted the pass and took it 72 yards the opposite direction for a touchdown this was a huge momentum shift in the game and gave the defense even more confidence stepping back on the fieldif not for a pair of cody brown penalties that accounted for 19 yards the breakers might not have scored on their next drive this could have left the stars headed to halftime up by 13 points these penalties kept this drive alive the first a facemask penalty took it from 2nd and 4 on the 8 to 1st and 4 on the 4 yard line this gave the breakers just enough attempts to punch it in with a pass to johnnie dixon their first points on the day but the breakers would close the gap to 6 and get the ball back at halfin the second halfcoming out of the half the breakers drove down field and kicked a field goal bringing them within one score on the ensuing drive one of the most bizarre decisions ive ever seen happened when cookus scrambled toward the right sideline to avoid the rush and instead of taking a one yard loss under hand threw it to a defender for an interception giving the breakers the ball back this mistake would ultimately disappear in the wash when the breakers kicker missed wide right leaving the score 1310 with the stars getting the ball backultimately the offense would drive down field for two more field goal attempts in the game aguilar would miss his first kick since week 3 late in the 4th leaving the score 1610 stars the stars have won backtoback games without scoring a single offensive touchdownthis w is for usflblob pictwittercomekhepfnkhl philadelphia stars usflstars may 21 2023the goodthe stars are finding ways to win that dont involve scoring on offense its not necessarily a sustainable way to win games but it is very encouraging from a fans perspective ifwhen the stars figure out their offensive woes this team could be tough to beatpass rushthe pass rush got back on the board notching two sacks of mcleod bethel thompson both chris nelson and adam rodriguez adding to their career totals they also caused a few errant throws that the secondary took advantage of this defensive unit stepped up in a big way in two straight games slowing down two of the better offenses in the league forcing 6 turnovers in their last two victories is a big reason why the stars stand atop the north division for nowrun gamethis was by far the best performance in the run game for the stars producing 121 yards on the day todays performance by colburn 13 carries 62 yards 2 receptions 13 yards puts colburn at 959 all purpose yards in his stars career i expect him to top 1000 against the maulers dexter williams was the most effective runner on the day with 63 yards per carry but he only saw 3 carries for 19 yards total cookus accounted for 43 yardsoffensive linethe line did not allow a single sack after previously averaging nearly 5 sacks a game after week 5 not only did cookus have time to throw but running backs had room to run i dont know what the stars told their offensive line this week but it needs to be the pregame speech every week now great job by the guys up front rebounding from 5 straight ugly performances while this was by no means a perfect performance for the stars it was encouraging and gives me hope for the rest of the season this is the perfect time for this line to gelrun defenseafter watching the stars again give up over 150 yards on the ground to the generals i expected this would be another 100 yard day for wes hills hills didnt top 100 yards and managed 74 yards just over 4 yards per carry and didnt score a touchdown on the day this might be the most surprising facet of this victory for the stars to this point their ability to stop the run had been the achilles heel of an otherwise talented defensive unitthe badcase cookus just finished what might be the worst performance of his usfl career given a rushing attack and more time to throw i would have expected a better performance and an improvement in his recent stat lines i would have been wrong cookus came out and looked like he was serving up some comfort food to the breakers including the interception i spoke about beforethis was baffling to me cookus had been solid despite a lack of a rushing attack or time to throw but today given more of both he has his worst game in a stars uniform 17 of 27 for 238 yards 0 tds and 2 interceptions and 1 fumble he nearly ended up being the difference in this game for a breakers victory cookus is better than this and i expect this to be an aberrationkick off coveragethe kickoff coverage unit needs to step it up in this game stove averaged nearly 26 yards per return if not for a strong defensive effort on the day this starting field position could have been dangerous they face some really talented return men looking forward this is one key factor they can correct to help out their defense its clear the coaches had field position on their minds given the signing of lirim hajrullalu to handle punting and kick offs maybe the unit just needs to adjust to his big legweek 7 previewwith the stars winning and the maulers generals and panthers all losing this week theyre on top of the division at just 33 with four games remaining in a division that still looks wide open this game could go a long way toward deciding who makes the playoffs out of the norththe maulers previously defeated the stars to send them to the 4th spot in the division at 13 now it could be the stars who return the favor to the maulers one in thing is certain the stars offense needs to find a way into the endzone going forward kicking your way to victories isnt a formula for a championship team in our last two victories luis aguilar accounted for 34 points out of the 40 scored by the starsinjuryreportby all accounts chris rowland is done for the season which means the stars need to continue to work terry wright into this offense in the first half against the breakers he had 3 targets and 1 reception for 30 yards he added 2 kick returns for 53 yards as wellbetting oddsbetting odds were not released when this article was submitted if i had to guess i would expect to see a 3 point spread in philadelphias favor due to their recent wins i would expect an overunder of 42 points betting the under might be your best course of action in this gamepredictionsstars are hot right now winning their last two games albeit on the strength of their special teams and defense the maulers are fighting their own struggles and are coming off their worst performance on offense this season scoring zero points as a team and throwing three interceptions between two quarterbacks is not encouraging if youre a maulers fan if the stars defense can control the run game of the maulers like the showboats did this should make it three in a row for the stars they have to contain troy williams from running all over them and isaiah hennie has to be your biggest concern in the passing game he was targeted 11 times in their last game catching 8 for 103 yards bringing him to 44 targets 29 receptions 271 yards and 1 touchdown on the year2420 stars over the maulersif youre a fan of the usfl or the xfl tune in every monday through the

the offensive line that now only has six players that will be active jair joseph is the only backup lineman for the gamblers which makes it more imperative that the line stays healthy walker being out

used to bahars ankle appears to still not be 100 percent which has affected the way he is stepping through his accuracy is hovering around 50 percent since returning from injury he needs to find a way to convert highpercentage throws leading to scoreshoustons offense is dictated by how well thompson can run the ball last week was the first game this season where he was shut down with his carries the gamblers need to get the running game going from the start and it will help if they are able to get a higher amount of completions in the passing gamedefensively the loss of walker will have an impact on how they get to the quarterback as he is tied for the team lead in sacks with four luckily they have bingham who is the other player on the team with four sacks but houston will need guys like isaiah chambers to step up and rush the quarterback pittsburghs mo is to run the ball so the front seven will have their work cut out for them by stopping the run and forcing the maulers to the passevery game moving forward is a critical one for the gamblers as the south division is as competitive as it gets where anyone can make the playoffs this has the feel of a trap game with how good

stadiumthis will be rematch of the week 3 outing where the breakers defeated the stallions 4531 birmingham will look to return the favor in a game that could decide the south division titleheading into the game the stallions have been through their fair share of ups and downs going 22 the past four weeks last saturday they defeated the michigan panthers 2713 behind a masterclass performance from quarterback alex mcgough he threw for 133 yards and two touchdowns on 24 pass attempts while adding 82 yards and a score on the ground hes been the engine of the stallions offense that have needed him to step up at every turn they will need another great performance from their signal caller in this onemeanwhile the breakers have been spiraling the past two weeks suffering backtoback losses despite starting the year as one of the most dominant offenses they scored just 10 points in both gamesas aforementioned the usfl season is wide open as every team has lost at least two games

situationsmcleod bethelthompson shredded the birmingham defense in their last meeting he threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns while completing 714 of his passes early on he was riding high as a potential mvp candidate in their last two losses though hes been uncharacteristically bad as hes committed five turnovers three interceptions two fumbles lost since then he also hasnt been completing his passes as consistently leading to less scoring opportunities and successful drivesnevertheless he still leads the usfl in passing yards and will need to pick apart his weaknesses and make him force things birmingham cant let him get hot or else the could suffer a similar outcome to their first meetingstuff the run gapsjust like bethelthompson the breakers have the leading rusher in wes hills he leads the league with 500 rushing yards and has the secondmost rushing touchdowns with eight in spite of that he hasnt had a standout game since week 4 in their last two games hes rushed for 112 yards on 32 attempts 35 yards per carry hes yet to find the end zone in three weeks and will be hungry to get there especially when he scored three times against the stallions in week 3hills has a knack for finding a way to make an impact in games whether its on the ground or in the passing game defensive coordinator john chavis should have a pair of adjustments ready for this upcoming matchup to make sure he doesnt replicate his performancestallionsbreakers previewas the line shows this is going to be the tightest matchup of the weekend both teams are motivated to take this one birmigham wants to avenge their loss while new orleans would like to get back into the win columna lot of the keys to victory for the stallions will need to be defensive adjustments birminghams offense put up 31 points which shouldve been good enough to win but the defense couldnt get a stop they gave up 45 points but havent given up anything near that sincebirmighams offense is loaded with talent but the difference in this one could be its defense theyve gotten healthier on that side of the ball in recent weeks and it proved to be a big factor in last weeks win they will need to do a better job of forcing turnovers and generating sacks its going to be a tight matchup and the game will probably be decided based on who has the ball last additionally it will depend on which quarterback will outduel the other mcgough has proven to be the better and more consistent quarterback and should narrowly will his team to victoryprediction stallions 30 breakers 28subscribe to our usfl news hub

cottrell started his coaching career at rutgers and was once upon a time a defensive assistant for the new jersey generals back in 19841985 its all coming full circle for the veteran coach who is no

coaching both the defensive line and linebacker positions however he has coordinated 43 defenses in the past like his time working under herman edwards with the new york jets two decades ago seeing

league in nearly 40 years to begin a second season the usfl is once again leading the way with new rules that give fans more action while increasing fairnessthe usfl prides itself on being the most fanfriendly professional sports league in america so last year we implemented rules we thought worked at the professional and college levels while adding some of our own innovations to give fans the traditional play they know and love with more fastpaced elements said mike pereira usfl head of officiating were proud our rules started a conversation throughout the football landscape that delivered big play potential enhanced player safety improved game flow provided more scoring opportunities for trailing teams and centralized replay to get officiating calls right in a way thats fair transparent and fastduring the 2022 season innovative usfl rules brought back the excitement of traditional kickoff returns while maintaining player safety created an electrifying and timeefficient overtime shootout that enhanced player safety while being fair to both teams added the possibility of 9point scores with 3point 2point or 1point conversion opportunities allowed double forward passes and initiated a 4th downand12 play as an alternative to rarely successful onside kicksin 2023 were taking it one step further with new innovative rules that will keep fans more engaged and entertained while collectively being good for the game of football that we all love concluded pereirathrough its social media channels today the league will officially reveal several 2023 usfl rules videos

had an 81 percent return rate moving the ball back five more yards should increase returns to the desired usfl return rate of 90 percent while maintaining player safetychanging the rule that when a runner fumbles the ball from the field of play into and out of the end zone the ball is returned to the spot of the fumble and the fumbling team retains possessionallowing each team to carry an inactive emergency third quarterback to ensure fairness if he is activated and enters the game anytime in the first three quarters the first two quarterbacks cannot reenter the game if he enters in

usfl bounced back in a big way in week 4 saturday nights audience delivery was a smashing successprior to week 4 the usfl averaged 618000 viewers in their first three weeks this past weekend the league averaged 989250 viewersthe usfls network partner strategy of airing the usfl after the kentucky derby was a brilliant strategy and it paid offthe idea besides the obvious is to try and lure in casual sports fans to sample the leagues product in the short term it did the trick especially in the leagues first hour which averaged over 16 million viewersin year two the usfls multiplepoint strategy is to build off year one carryover fans from 2022 and hopefully attract sports viewers who are typically on the fence about these leagues to try and come along for the ridethe usfls exposure on nbc and fox with three games on broadcast television certainly helps but gaining a new audience is the tricky partthe elephant in the room this week was the absence of the xfl both leagues have cannibalized each others audience since midapril with games that aired headtohead or overlapped in the same time slots having the xfl out of the way certainly helped boost the usfls weekly average from what until this point has been down from the first few weeks of last seasonthe xfl returns this coming weekend with their final game of the season their league championship game on saturday night the good news is that neither leagues game will be headtohead one can only imagine what this past saturday night wouldve looked like if both leagues were headtohead on network televisionwe got a taste

to the gamewe are on a colehighly anticipated offseason quarterback cole kelley is set to start his second consecutive game in 2023 after the showboats seemingly moving on from the brady white experience who you may have heard attended memphis kelley came in a delivered a muchneeded spark to the underwhelming showboats offense kelley threw for over 300 yards in week 3 including two tds and while leading the team in rushing if michigan is looking to sink the ships the first step is stopping kelley who was a kenji bahar game winning drive from giving memphis their first win of the seasonsack attackthe panthers imposed their will on opposing quarterbacks by starting off the season with multisack games against their first two opponents while the pass rush cooled a bit in week 3 with garrett marino being obtaining the panthers lone sack michigan needs to continue to dominate the line of scrimmage and let the panthers defense to play to their strengths with panthers set to take on the 67 frame of cole kelley michigans front seven will have to muscle up after dealing with the shifty deandre johnson in week 3bounce back from reggie corbinthe showboats rank 7 in the usfl giving up 1323 rushing yards per game through the first three weeks of the season memphis has given 397 rushing yards through the first three weeks of the season priming the 2022 allusfl rb for another breakout game in the early weeks of the usfl season corbin currently ranks 3rd in the usfl with 198 rushing yards and has opened his game up a bit more by becoming another option in the panthers passing attack already eclipsing his receptions from 2022 through three games of the 2023 seasonclosing thoughtsthe panthers have the benefit of not being surprised by cole kelley and have the luxury of having a week of film on the 67 passer in addition to a lack of surprise from kelley the showboats have placed alex collins on the teams injured reserve list for the remainder of the season giving kerrith whyte and juwann washington 2022 returnee the opportunity to take the majority of snaps behind kelleywhile the panthers do have some injuries they are also dealing with the core foundation of the teams offense and defense remain relatively healthy through the first three weeks of the season for michigan the gameplan really comes down to 2ndyear qb and 4year pro football veteran josh love and his ability to manage the offense love saw major regression in week 3 having several passes batted down and was even somewhat outplayed by carson strong in his quick cameo appearance that led to a trey quinn receiving touchdownwhile i do suspect both defenses to play admirably the panthers front seven is dramatically better than the gamblers that saw kelley pass for over 300 yards michigans pass rush should continue to make life difficult for kelley meaning the panthers offense will have to cash in on the opportunity given to them by frank ginda and companywhile i do believe the panthers will come out victorious in week 4 i do predict an ugly win that is spearhead by reggie corbin rather than josh love ultimately the panthers come out 2410 in a game that

into two interceptions in the earlier matchup and will likely need to do something similar to have a chance in the title gamespecifically mcgoughs ability to extend plays with his feet and keep the chains moving has been a key part of birminghams offense mcgough was responsible for 394 yards and five touchdowns in his teams runaway win over the breakersthe maulers will have to devise a scheme

philadelphia stars offense is back finally after waiting 8 and a half quarters the stars offense has found the endzone once again many stars fans including myself had criticized and questioned why this offense looked like a shadow of its 2022 self even after bringing in more nfl talent than last season the team was stagnant defenses had the blueprint on how to stop us and were doing it well for much of the seasonit seems theduring the first matchup with pittsburgh their defense intercepted cookus twice and forced him to fumble once these three turnovers and three sacks were the difference in the game killing three drives for the stars and leading directly to points for the maulers in week seven it looked like we were in for another low scoring affairjust nine minutes into the game both offenses had put seven on the board and looked to move the ball at will from there the league that claims to keep the special in special teams would watch special teams put up 13 points on 3 consecutive drives the most important take away from these drives for the starsrushing attack reboundsthe rushing attack with matt colburn looked strong ripping off 42 yards on their first three drives alone their season average to this point had just barely topped 50 yards and it looked like colburn was taking that fact personally by halftime these teams who had both looked allergic to scoring at times had put up 44 points on the board with only two drives ending in turnovers three turnovers in four drives had the stars fans wondering if we would watch another loss to pittsburghthis is when the scoring fest hit a lull with seven straight drives ending without points to end this streak the maulers missed wide left turning the ball over at the 44 yard line leaving the score at 2024 on the last play of the third quarter when cookus called for the snap he dropped back and faced immediate pressure corey coleman beats the press coverage on the outside albeit possibly illegally catches the pass with nothing but pay dirt ahead of him he scores the touchdown and aguilar stays perfect on the day converting the pat putting stars up 3 points headed into the 4th quarterthe stars defense would go on to pitch a shut out in the second half with the special teams unit allowing hennie to add to the special teams explosion on the day with a punt return for the touchdown the stars offense meanwhile continued to grind out the yards leaning on the ground game to do so this produced ten more points with the stars taking 8 minutes and 14 seconds off the clock in three drives this was the best game of the season so far by the stars offense and its refreshed my faith in the unit for the stretch rundub cityyyy winning is l i v i n g  forphilly pictwittercomkexoj3qbtb philadelphia stars usflstars may 28 2023week 8 previewin week 8 the stars face the stallions in their house at 3 pm eastern time on peacock and nbc the stallions again look like the best team in the league despite injuries decimating them on both sides of the ball with the stallions 52 having defeated two of the three teams that handed the stars their losses this could be the toughest test for philadelphia yetif your weakness is the run game there are few teams you want to face less than the stallions the second ranked running game in the league in terms of overall rushing yards and yards per carry their top running back is 4th in rushing yards and averaging 45 yards per carry to get there on top of that alex mcgough is one of the most athletic quarterbacks in the league and has added 318 yards which stands 6th on the season this offense can move the ball with the best of them in the passing game as well and mcgough has limited mistakes overalloffensethe good news is the stallions have been beat before allowing 45 points to the breakers in week 3 and losing to houston in week 5 allowing mark thompson to find the endzone 3 times colburn needs to get his in this game and andrus needs to stay dedicated to the run game to beat this stallions defense we saw it on the coleman touchdown that the stars would like to incorporate play action to allow routes to develop and thats precisely the formula they need to incorporate if they expect to beat last years champions this could end up being a preview of the usfl championship once again in 2023sammyyyyy  more tds coming soon from this duo s_akem18 x captaincookus10 pictwittercomiji7ahuqh5 philadelphia stars usflstars may 31 2023defensebrad miller and his defensive staff have a tall task this week it starts and ends with the defensive line against birmingham if they can hold up against the run and contain mcgough forcing birmingham to become one dimensional it plays into the stars roster construction and defensive philosophy they did a great job of keeping troy williams in check this week but its imperative they duplicate that performance against mcgough to collect a fourth straight victorylabryanray came with the pressure  pictwittercomxzbjttt5fz philadelphia stars usflstars may 31 2023special teamsthis was a terrible showing but the special teams unit they allowed 307 yards and 2 touchdowns to josh simmons and isiah hennie on the day allowing 333 yards per kick return meant the maulers had good starting field position all game long the field goal unit meanwhile saw an errant snap give momentum and a 10 point swing to the maulers looking at this alone the stars special teams unit helped account for 21 points out of the 31 scored by the maulers its clear the team has made moves to try and help this situation but so far it hasnt amounted to the success they had hopedwith the usfl attempting to bring the special back to special teams the stars will need to find a way to cover kicks better allowing nearly 300 yards in returns in the kickoff game certainly isnt going to cut it when your opponent is starting past the 25 on the majority of their drives youre putting your defense in a tough position

everyone engaged and involved by giving them time on the active roster and in turn paying them the extra 2500 an active player receives versus being inactive this will keep players happier than they would be strictly riding the bench all season long and more importantly it shows that all of these players truly have a role on the team and arent just depth pieces waiting to be released for the next shiny big namethis week the stars also brought in some new offensive firepower and were forced to replace an offensive lineman who they had high hopes fortransferred player to active rosterqb kevin

in at left tackle where antonio garcia no longer resides this will be a position to watch after two games with just one sack the stars cant afford a regression in this category they must continue to protect the quarterback and open up rushing lanes himmelman is a recent nfl cut so hopefully he can hold his own this week against these stallions on defensehere is your week 8 depth chart for usflstars vs usflstallions pictwittercom07byd71b49 usfl usfl june 2 2023betting oddsthis week the stars open this game as 6 point underdogs to the very well rounded stallions with alex mcgough playing like the league mvp cj marable making fans forget all about bo scarbrough and the defense playing one of their best games last week this point spread is spot onthe moneyline is stallions 227 to win with the stars 175 underdogs the overunder is set at 455 points for the gamepredictionsgiven the way both of these teams have played i expect this game to see many points scored although john chavis had a great game plan last week i believe the stars have found a way to balance out their offense and buy case cookus more time to throw aiding a line that needs all the help it can get however the stallions defeated the stars twice last season and the stars arguably were much better at running the ball and protecting the quarterback at the timei unfortunately dont see the stars picking up the w this weekthe stallions led by skip holtz have lost just three out of 19 usfl games so far in two seasons i think they add victory 17 in 20 tries this week and make it a clean 30 against the stars since the relaunch in 2022 in my opinion i would put my money on the stallions to cover and the over in this game as i have the stallions beating the stars by 7 and the two teams scoring 61 points on

his prior experience but will have to wait till another team signs himladarren brown kajohn armstrong and treshaun hayward were among the others released this past weekend brown was a running back who many thought would be guaranteed a roster spot due to josh adams joining the vanderbilt coaching staff hayward was a late signing to the panthers during training camp and was seemingly in an up hill

14 2023the stars head into week one against the memphis showboatsthat inexplicably have a dog as a mascotbut thats a story for another day its slightly ironic that the showboats were relocated and rebranded because theyre a completely different team from last seasonthe showboats no longer have jordan taamu who has looked much better in the xfl with dc by the way and are moving forward with memphiss own brady white white would graduate from memphis playing from 20182020 with the team playing in 39 games for the school he looked like a competent quarterback he passed for 10690 yards 90 tds to 30 ints with 7 rushing touchdowns during the stretch he earned a long list of awards and engrained himself in the minds of memphis fansqb1 in our hearts and on the field get to know bradywhite223 in this edition of jarvisgreerwmc 100yard walk  pictwittercomygaguj4drx memphis showboats usflshowboats april 14 2023its a good thing that they didnt have to see his performance for the tampa bay bandits last season during which he managed just 7 completions on 17 attempts 0 touchdowns 1 interception hopefully for his sake given an offseason of training to be the starter staying in the same offense with primarily the same coaching staff allowed him to continue building on last season white gets the start in the home opener playing in front of memphis fans at the same stadium he called home for three seasons not long agoi mention this because memphis has a long history of supporting alternative football dating back to 1974 memphis has hosted alternative football off and on for nearly 50 years this includes the world football league original usfl cfl xfl aaf and now the usfl once againmemphis were home  pictwittercomhv7dxjjmkd memphis showboats usflshowboats april 14 2023i expect home field advantage to be in full effect this weekend when these teams face off during the aafs season the memphis express averaged 12944 fans per game they also started four different quarterbacks none of which played at memphis if reports from the league are true we could see over 25000 fans show up to saturdays season opener this could prove to be the best home field advantage in the usfl if white plays well this seasonthanks to the more than 25000 who already have their tickets for tomorrow goboats tickets httpstcopj0nrgujf3 httpstcoj6zpbouhxh steve macy stevemacy april 14 2023according to cbssportscom the odds for this game are set at stars 25 points which is right in line with my prediction at the end of this article the stars have a more well rounded roster with many more experienced alternative football league players which should bode well for their success this season much like it did in 2022 if the stars are able to get on an early season roll we could see them go on a run as the coaches have discussed at length they want to adjust as they golooking at the injury reports both teams could be missing playersgame status updatejosh nurse db doubtful r

delrick abramstheyre already pretty well handicapped against this team the stars have no shortage of talent at wideout and like to spread the ball around if last season is any indication they look to be in better shape than the showboats with most players likely to play tight end in particular could get interesting with bug howard out more on that in a momentif we are looking at these two rosters objectively they are actually fairly well matchedquarterback evenat quarterback the stars walk into this game with case cookus kevin thomson and vad lee as their qb room cookus was one of the better quarterbacks in the league last season thomson was showing promise in the cfl before an injury and vad lee finished last season as the maulers leading passer but now looks like he might be the third quarterback with the starsmemphis has brady white ryan willis and cole kelley all three of these quarterbacks are capable of starting so i dont expect a long leash for white if he struggles and i would argue white isnt the best player at the position on the roster he was likely chosen due to the location of the hub and his time in the system last season you have to wonder what is going through ryan williss mind right nowrunning back evenstars have matt colburn dexter williams and darnell holland injured reserve all three of which are dangerous backs that are also valuable in the passing game colburn had an impressive stretch last season of scoring in consecutive games and i expect him to be first off the bench williams will likely be 1b in this rotation with holland as the change of pace and 3rd down back when healthy in his absence we could see more jet sweeps and creativity in the run game utilizing the backgrounds of corey coleman and chris rowland as runnersshowboats have alex collins david hamm and justin stockton all three of these players are solid backs stockton and hamm have experience playing alternative football while collins is getting his first taste collins could be a break out back this season but i expect all three to be involved this is a dramatically improved unit over last season when they were easily the worst backfield in the leaguewide receiver starsthe stars last season had four receivers catch 20 or more passes two of those players were signed by nfl teams but only one returned however im very confident in diondre overton who appears to be the next man up in the lineup as well as samuel akem a premier receiver from montana terry wright an alternative league veteran and keric wheatfall another interesting prospectmeanwhile last season the bandits as they were known didnt seem to have many elite weapons in fact only two players caught more than 19 passes that isnt to say this group is without talent in fact derrick dillon is one of the better receivers in the league but as a position group i have to give it to the stars for overall depthtight end leaning memphisthe stars have four tight ends listed on their roster two of which were with the team last season in bug howard reserve list and pro wells probable as well as two new comers ryan izzo probable and larry dalla betta with two players who are relative unknowns on how limited they will be atop the depth chart and the best tight end in the league on reserve im not sure what to expect from the stars hereshowboats have daniel helm and jay jay wilson they also have corbin kaufusi who caught a pass last season and could get looks on run downs the reason i like the depth chart with the showboats more currently is theyre all healthy and they seem to compliment each other daniel helm has bounced around to six different nfl teams in three years but never played much jay jay wilson played but at a lower level in the indoor football league wilson is more of a move tight end who can create mismatches and actually has seen time at wide receiver and fullback helm is your prototypical tight end who is solid as a blocker with room to grow hes also a decent athlete although his combine numbers wont blow you away nor will his college production as a unit i expect these two and their larger counterpart who moonlights as an offensive lineman could end up as one of the better groups in the leagueoffensive line starsthe stars had one of the better offensive lines in 2022 i expect that to continue in 2023 they brought back several key members of the unit and managed to also bring in a few new players who should be valuable pieces even if just as depthwith the showboats they gave up 29 sacks in 10 games and helped contribute to a run game that produced just 573 yards when you remove taamus rushing stats no offense can sustain a passing game when youre averaging 57 yards per game rushing and 4 touchdowns the team ran the ball 270 times in 2022 showing a willingness but a lack of execution their only additions could be a mixed bagdefensive line eventhe stars made more moves on their defensive line than anywhere else on the team bringing in carson taylor ali fayad darius hodge they also released tony fair and antwan owens i like the players they brought in but i wonder if defensive tackle isnt a weakness currently they needed to shore up their run defense but didnt make a ton of moves at defensive tackle it will be interesting to see how the moves the stars made pan outshowboats have mammoth defensive tackles with viane moala 66 305 lbs daylon mack 61340 lbs and john atkins at 63 320 lbs but they also have positional versatility in a couple guys i expect to kick inside to rush the passer when needed dillon faamatau at 63 285 lbs listed as a defensive tackle as well as defensive ends jordan williams 65 285 lbs and jeremiah valoaga at 66 275 lbs this should in theory set them up to be a solid run defense but they didnt stop at thatthey also have pass rushers big kat bryant kahzin daniels and jeff mcculloch all three of these guys stand 245 pounds or less and all three have a background that is conducive to collecting sacks mcculloch is the only player at defensive end to log a statistic in 2022 with the bandits collecting 55 total tackles and 1 sack big kat bryant is a hybrid who can stand up and play linebacker or rush the passer full time his best season came in 2021 at defensive end with ucf where he had 6 sacks kahzin daniels spent some time with the tampa bay buccaneers in college daniels was a monster racking up 44 tackles for a loss and 25 sacks he managed two years with 95 sacks or more this unit could be solid if theyre able to gel and be used as a rotation situationallylinebacker showboatsthe stars lost jordan moore to suspension early this offseason thats s huge blow to this defense even with the moves they have made to shore up their linebacking group with tevon coney and gabriel sewell returning as well as newcomers kadofi wright joey alfieri and jordan genmarkheath this group is solid but its another big unknown for the team especially with little in the way of details for moores suspensionshowboats have lost a couple players at the position emmanuel beal most notably who first tried to pursue the xfl only to get cut blow up on twitter and then end up in the cfl prior to ending up in the usfl anthony butler had multiple nfl teams looking his way he would spend time with the colts but wind up released this allowed memphis to pick him up butler could be your direct replacement for beal the showboats seem to like smaller faster linebackers with every player at the position standing 241 lbs or less greg reaves stands 241 lbs but also sees time at defensive end this could make them vunerable to the run game with their focus clearly being on the passing game i have to give memphis the edge here their group seems to be talented experienced and ready to go in 2023secondary starsthe stars feature two alternative football stalwarts in channing stribling and cody brown both played in the aaf xfl and usfl and are regarded as top end players for the league while stribling led the team and league with 7 interceptions amani dennis ahmad dixon and ladarius wiley all managed interceptions as well producing 11 as a team in 10 games this was a huge reason the stars led the turnover differential in 2022 with 8 their talent as a unit might make them the best in the league let alone this gamememphis has playmakers in the secondary but theyre not nearly the talent laden unit that the stars have with interesting players across the board including quinton meeks who collected a couple interceptions last season however the unit simply cant stand up to the starsspecial teams starsthe stars had their fair share of struggles trying to get their kicking game where it needed to be but at first their strength was their punt game that was until a switch at the specialist position where matt mengel primarily a punter was replaced by luis aguilar primarily a kicker he would go several weeks without missing a kick but the ypunt unit suffered somewhat dropping in per punt average substantially the return unit led by maurice alexander was one of the best in the league producing the highest per return averagethe showboats had a struggles trying to get tyler rausa to clean up his consistency but after going 9 of 14 last season the team moved on to a new kicker alex kessman he spent time with three nfl franchises but played in just one game with the jets in that game he would not attempt a field goal but gozero for two on extra points kessman isnt exactly the model for consistency in terms of accuracy he held a 71 accuracy rate in college he also kendall kick offs which is what i believe got him the opportunity in the nfl in the first place teams see that hes got one of the strongest legs you can find out the freeagent market for kickers but they all believe they can fix his accuracy issues and so far no one has brandon wright was one of the better punters in the league on 45 punts he had just 16 returned he had a long of 76 yards last year their return game lacked explosiveness but we will see if they make a change at kick returnerfinal wordsoverall this game is a lot closer match than a lot of people really think showboats were always a well coached team there was just in my mind moves that needed to be made from a roster perspective that were never made until the offseason the bandits handicapped jordan taamu last season asking him to carry an offense without a run game and overcome a return game that couldnt produce more than 23 yards per return and as if that wasnt enough also a kick in game that left 16 points on the board last seasonnot only is this a different team because jordan taamu is no longer there to carry them its a different team because they dont need him to at this point they need to run the ball convert kicks and reduce turnovers in my personal opinion the players with the showboats now at quarterback all seem to be more natural fits in haleys offense than taamu my main concern is their offensive line if they dont prove to be better this season any hopes memphis has of competing for a championship game will be dashed quicklymy prediction for this gamestars 2824
