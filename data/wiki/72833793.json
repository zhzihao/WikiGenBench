{"id": 72833793, "key": "Shooting of Jason Harley Kloepfer", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting%20of%20Jason%20Harley%20Kloepfer", "text": "Jason Harley Kloepfer, a 41-year-old man, was shot on December 13, 2022, by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indian Police SWAT Team at Kloepfer's home in Murphy, North Carolina, United States. Kloepfer survived and in January 2023 released surveillance video from inside his home that showed events that differed from the initial account of the shooting given by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office, which claimed that Kloepfer engaged in a \"verbal altercation with officers\" and \"confronted officers\". The video showed that Kloepfer exited his house with his arms raised as per police's instructions, while he was holding onto a cigarette and a camera-equipped robot which police had thrown into his home; Kloepfer was shot around four seconds later, when his arms were still raised. Within hours of the shooting, Kloepfer was charged with communicating threats, as well as resist, obstruct and delay, but these charges were dropped by March 2023. The police's actions are being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. Kloepfer has filed a federal lawsuit against officers from both police departments.\n\nShooting \n911 call records showed that there were 13 calls from May 2020 to September 2022 related to Jason Harley Kloepfer's residence, with the records stating that the calls were regarding incidents including \"welfare check\", \"assault\", \"disturbance\" and \"fireworks\".\n\nOn December 12, 2022, just before 11.20 p.m., a person called 911, claiming to be Kloepfer's neighbor. The caller indicated that Kloepfer \"about an hour ago, started shooting off fireworks, screaming, yelling, going to kill everyone in the neighborhood ... he's discharging a firearm ... They've been over there screaming, yelling and fighting for the last 45 minutes\". The caller then said: \"I just heard his wife screaming 'stop it,' and then a bunch of shots went off and now I can’t hear her over there at all.\" The caller then quotes his neighbor as saying: \"Send the police, I'll get them too.\"\n\nAround 11.20 p.m. on December 12, three Cherokee County deputies arrived at Kloepfer's home, and are heard saying: \"We haven’t been able to make contact with anybody at this residence ... There's a detached garage with music blaring in the garage. We can’t get anybody to come to the door at the garage either.\" The officers referenced seeing a bullet and security cameras at Kloepfer's home. The SWAT team of the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indian Police Department was summoned around 12.20 a.m. on December 13 to handle a potential hostage situation. A search warrant for Kloepfer's home was approved around 2.15 a.m. According to Kloepfer's later lawsuit, just before 2 a.m. of the night of the incident, an officer visited the neighbor to view her video of the complained behaviour; the lawsuit alleges that the video's only clear dialogue was a woman’s voice saying \"stop\" four times, but the video did not discernably show Kloepfer, his wife, or gunfire.\n\nAfter the Cherokee Indian Police Department's SWAT Team arrived at Kloepfer's home, surveillance footage from the inside of Kloepfer's house, starting at 4.54 a.m. on December 13, showed police throwing a robot with a light and cameras into Kloepfer's home. The robot starts to shine a light around the home; two minutes later, a light is shone into Kloepfer's bedroom, and this appears to wake Kloepfer and his wife, who says: \"What’s going on?\" Both call out: \"Hello?\" A police officer says through a loudspeaker: \"Jason ... Step outside ... Come outside, Jason ... Step outside the door onto the deck and show us your hands. Jason, we just want to talk to you. Come outside.\" While the officer is speaking, Kloepfer picks up the police's robot.\n\nAt 4.57 a.m. and 16 seconds, Kloepfer opens the door to his home, unarmed and with his hands in the air; he is holding a cigarette and the police's robot. Behind Kloepfer is his wife, whose hands are also in the air. Officers shout for Kloepfer to hold up his hands; at 4.57 a.m. and 20 seconds, Kloepfer is shot multiple times while he was holding up his hands. He fell to the floor, crying out: \"I’m shot!\" The police continued shooting even after Kloepfer had fallen to the floor.\n\nFollowing the shooting, Kloepfer's wife yells at officers: \"What the hell, he's shot, what the hell did you do?!\" Officers order Kloepfer and his wife to leave the home. While Kloepfer's wife follows the officers' orders to leave the home, both she and Kloepfer protest that he cannot do that because of his bullet wounds. On the floor, Kloepfer drags himself towards the door, protesting: \"I don’t have a gun! I didn’t have a gun!\" He sticks his hands out of the door frame. At 4.58 a.m, officers enter Kloepfer's home and step over Kloepfer, who still has his hands up. After an initial check of the home, one officer at 4.59 a.m informs another officer to \"start working on\" Kloepfer. Kloepfer is removed from his home. Three officers re-enter the home at 5 a.m, one shouts: \"Fuck bro, fuck\", while another says: “Hey, cameras, cameras!\"\n\nKloepfer was brought to a hospital and survived the shooting. He subsequently uploaded photos online showing bullet wounds at his chest, abdomen and arm.\n\nAftermath\n\nPolice actions and Kloepfer's charges \nAt 11.42 a.m on December 13, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office issued a press release stating that after a 911 call regarding multiple gunshots at a residence, police responded to the scene. The press release stated that deputies were \"unsuccessful\" in contacting the suspect, so the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office obtained a search warrant, and called in the Cherokee Indian Police Department SWAT Team due to \"an armed suspect present and the potential for a hostage situation\".\n\nThe press release went on to say that the Cherokee Indian Police SWAT Team shot Kloepfer after Kloepfer \"engaged in a verbal altercation with officers and emerged from a camper trailer and confronted officers\". \n\nThe press release stated that Kloepfer received two charges, the first being communicating threats, the second being resist, obstruct and delay, and that more charges were possible, according to the press release. Kloepfer was scheduled to appear in court on March 9. By March 1, the charges against Kloepfer had been dropped. According to the local dismissal document, the charge of making threats was dropped \"at the request of the prosecuting witness\", while the charge of resisting orders was dropped as \"the charging document does not list the type of orders given and under what circumstances that this would be a duty of their office\".\n\nThe Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Tribal Council in March 2023 tabled, and on April 6, 2023, approved a request from Cherokee Indian Police Department Chief Carla Neadeau to strip Cherokee Indian Police car and body camera videos of public record status. On April 25, 2023, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians Chief Richard Sneed signed the proposed change into law, meaning that court action would be needed before such footage could be published.\n\nAfter media outlets requested police footage of the shooting, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office refused to provide body camera footage, while Cherokee Indian Police Department Chief Carla Neadeau on April 24, 2023 responded: \"The Tribe does not have any video or audio recordings responsive to your request.\"\n\nKloepfer's release of surveillance footage \nWLOS reported in January 2023 that surveillance footage, published by Kloepfer, showing the inside of Kloepfer's house, \"appears to show a conflicting account of the event\" when compared to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office's press release. The Cherokee Scout agrees that \"key details\" of the press release seem to be contradicted. RTL.hu reported that the surveillance footage showed Kloepfer obeying police commands, in contrast to the press release's claim that Kloepfer confronted police. Skai Group agreed that Kloepfer was shot despite appearing to have complied with police orders. The Independent reported that the surveillance footage did not show Kloepfer engaging in a \"verbal altercation\" or confronting police, as claimed in the press release.\n\nCherokee County Sheriff Dustin Smith later stated that the press release was published without him having personal knowledge of what had happened, and the press release \"relied on information provided to us from the Cherokee Indian Police Department\". However, Smoky Mountain News reported that multiple Cherokee County deputies and investigators were at the scene during the shooting, and also reported that while Sheriff Smith was initially at his office that night, a later radio call after the shooting sees another officer telling Smith that a tribal police unit is \"wanting to follow you back to\" the sheriff's office, where \"they could unwind a little bit\", to which Smith responds: \"I'll take care of it.\" A lawsuit by Kloepfer alleges that Sheriff Smith was on the scene at the time of the shooting.\n\nSheriff Smith also stated that the aim of the press release \"was not to comment on the subsequent criminal investigation, which remains ongoing, but rather to update the public on a dangerous situation.\" Smith added that he did not see video of the shooting until January 18, 2023. Smith used the post to advocate for the creation for a SWAT team for Cherokee County.\n\nIn March 2023, Kloepfer's lawyer said that Kloepfer had even more video footage of the incident.\n\nReactions \nOn January 20, 2023, Kloepfer stated that he was \"physically doing better\", but he and his wife were mentally \"not so good\", \"out of state for fear of our lives since I got out the hospital\". He described the incident as a \"horrible nightmare\" and called his charges \"completely wrong\".\n\nVideo of the shooting received international attention. The surveillance footage has circulated online, including on YouTube, with one video receiving almost 100,000 views by the end of January 2023. Greek media outlet To Vima described the incident as another scandal of police brutality in the United States, and noted social media outrage over the police's use of force. Hungarian media outlet RTL.hu opined that Kloepfer's wife was lucky not to be shot in this incident.\n\nInvestigation into law enforcement\nThe North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation in December 2022 started an investigation into the shooting. The investigation continued past June 2023. The bureau does not make its investigation results public, but sends them to a district attorney, who will decide whether to file charges against any officers.\n\nHowever, on March 27, 2023, the Cherokee County District Attorney, Ashley Welch, sought to recuse from the case, citing that she and an assistant district attorney may be witnesses for the investigation, as they were contacted by a Cherokee County Sheriff's Office deputy hours after the shooting. As the \"allegations in this case involve potential crimes committed by a government official\", Welch requested the Office of the North Carolina Attorney General (Josh Stein) to step in.\n\nLawsuit\n\nKloepfer in June 2023 filed a federal lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against members of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Department and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indian Police Department, amongst others. Kloepfer's lawsuit alleges 25 counts of action, including excessive use of force, trespassing, gross negligence, and making false reports.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Surveillance video of the shooting: Shooting of Jason Harley Kloepfer – December 13, 2022 on YouTube\n\n Press release on December 13, 2022  by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office on Facebook\n\n Press release on January 20, 2023  by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office on Facebook\n\n Federal lawsuit   complaint and jury trial demand - June 20, 2023 by Jason H.

local law enforcement in one exchange with dispatch that night a sheriffs office employee told dispatch he was in the office to get some background on kloepfer adding i think weve dealt with him before yes multiple times the dispatcher replied records provided by cherokee county show that in the two years prior to the shooting there had been 11 calls to kloepfers address mostly related to noise fireworks and civil process worried that there could be a hostage in the camper  the woman who the neighbor had heard yell stop it before the gun fired  officers sought a search warrant which would allow them to enter the property even without someone answering the door in one call dispatch is asked to both start the search warrant process and contact cipd to request help from their swat team kloepfer shows the scars from his healing injuries jason harley kloepfer facebook photo the statement goes on to reference smiths platform during his campaign for sheriff saying that what happened dec 13 shows the need for cherokee county to have its own tactical team it is imperative for us to be selfreliant when it comes to fighting crime especially during a situation in which time is of the essence such as a hostage or active shooter event he wrote i will be asking county commissioners for the funds to create such a unit when budget negotiations for the next fiscal year begin commissioners didnt wait for formal budget negotiations to stake out their position on funding a swat team as shown on the cherokee scouts recordingof the jan 23 meeting chairman cal stiles introduced a resolutionopposing creation of a swat team for cherokee county the resolution affirms the boards support of law enforcement but says commissioners have grave concerns regarding the establishment of a swat team including but not limited to the cost to cherokee county taxpayers the minimal need for a swat team the preservation of the constitutional rights of the citizens of the county and the exorbitant amount of liability to which the county may be exposed the board tabled the resolution for discussion feb 6 according to county manager randy wiggins smith attended that meeting and told the board he had no intention of requesting swat team funding for the 20232024 budget so the board chose not to vote on the resolution as is the case with any officerinvolved shooting the incident is under investigation by the nc state bureau of investigations sbi reports never become public but instead are passed along to the district attorney who reviews their contents and determines whether charges are warranted against any law enforcement officers involved district attorney ashley welch and cipd chief carla neadeau declined to comment for this story citing the ongoing investigation

shooting victim alleges attempted murder seeks millions in damages written by holly kays tuesday june 20 2023 jason kloepfer and alison mahler have not felt safe enough to return home to kloepfers property 20 minutes outside of murphy since the police shooting dec 13 2022 holly kays photo in an explosive federal lawsuit filed tuesday in the us district court of western north carolina the victim of a december 2022 police shooting in cherokee county seeks millions of dollars in damages while laying out the sequence of alleged violations of policy and law that led to what he says was an attempted murder by police the shots were fired by members of the cherokee indian police department which had been called to assist the cherokee county sheriffs office jason harley kloepfer says he was asleep in bed with his wife alison mahler the morning of dec 13 when shortly before 5 am a police robot entered their trailer waking them up complying with commands from the loudspeaker outside kloepfer opened the door with his hands held above his head mahler standing behind him four seconds later the officers unleashed a torrent of bullets  about 15 the lawsuit says  critically wounding kloepfer and barely missing mahler ostensibly the officers were there to respond to a potential hostage situation based on testimony and evidence from a neighbor law enforcement said in court documents and press releases that they believed that kloepfer may have injured mahler andor been holding her against her will but in the 195page lawsuit kloepfer makes the case that at multiple points before the shooting occurred officers had all the information they needed to know that the hostage story was false their decision to shoot kloepfer while he held no weapon and was complying with police instructions  with the purported hostage standing directly behind him  did not reflect the actions of a police unit seeking to protect an innocent victim instead the lawsuit says the shooting was an attempted execution at close range bushwhacking jason was the plan all along the lawsuit reads her original claims are false cherokee county deputies responded to kloepfers home about 20 minutes outside of murphy following an 11 pm 911 call dec 12 from a neighbor who said she had video of him threatening to kill the whole neighborhood and that she was concerned for mahlers safety after hearing her scream stop it followed by a bunch of shots and then nothing more from mahler three deputies were immediately dispatched to kloepfers home related items latest 2023 a look back not on my watch award newly elected haywood county sheriff bill wilke stepped into some big shoes following the latest cherokee county sheriffs office answers police shooting lawsuit in a 65page answer to an extensive lawsuit filed in response to the december 2022 police latest judge rules on motion to dismiss claims in police shooting suit the court has made its decision in the cherokee county sheriffs offices request to archived news sbi report on police shooting heads to special prosecutor nearly 11 months after a cherokee county man was shot by police officers in the doorway the deputies didnt drive their patrol cars up to the house  instead they parked down by the road without turning on their flashing lights walked up to the property and began to snoop around the lawsuit says they knocked on the door several times but didnt identify themselves as sheriffs deputies nobody answered  the lights were off and blinds drawn the lawsuit says it was impossible to tell if kloepfer and mahler were even home at this point the lawsuit argues that the deputies legal justification for being on the property without a warrant had ended and they should have left however they stayed on scene and never took the fiveminute walk to the neighbors house to find out more about the allegations or view the video it was not until 141 am that a deputy knocked on kloepfers door while announcing himself as a representative of the cherokee county sheriffs department kloepfer and mahler did not hear that knock the lawsuit says because they were asleep it was nearly 2 am before an officer finally visited the neighbor to view the video that video turned out to not support the accusations at all the lawsuit claims none of the video clips showed kloepfer threaten anyone nor did they show gunfire coming from his property they didnt show discernable images of kloepfer or mahler or contain any discernable dialogue other than a womans voice saying stop four times at that point the sheriffs department knows that the neighbor has no proof the suit states her original claims are false as soon as the officers know that the neighbors allegations are false all the officers should immediately leave but they didnt leave about 15 minutes later lt milton teasdale applied for a search warrant the complaint alleges teasdale did so based only on the neighbors 911 call and did not speak with any of the officers who had been on scene for nearly three hours meanwhile the cherokee indian police department swat team was on its way to murphy after sheriff dustin smith approved a request for assistance around 1230 am they just ignored his dying request by 454 am the swat team had surrounded the house and without asking permission or knocking sent a drone robot inside equipped with a camera that sent realtime video footage to a screen outside when kloepfer complying with commands came outside with his hands up  the robot in his right hand and a lit cigarette in his left  several swat team members including at least officers ferguson opened fire and shot at jason and ali the lawsuit says at least two rounds hit kloepfer one entered through his chest and lacerated his liver cut through his stomach and the lining of his heart cracked his ribs and scattered shrapnel in his chest a second struck just above his elbow blowing a tunnel through his flesh and muscle after the shooting officers did not immediately offer medical aid instead the lawsuit alleges two members of the swat team stepped through the door and over kloepfer without assisting him then walked through his home and bedroom later another swat team member grabbed jason by one arm as he was lying on his back in the doorway and dragged him down a wooden ramp to the cold dirt and rocks only then did they provide emergency aid meanwhile the suit alleges ccsd officers forced mahler the purported hostage to kneel on the ground cuffing her hands behind her back and forcing her into the back of a police car they did not allow her to put on shoes or proper clothes against the cold december predawn or to see her husband who she feared was dying kloepfer who also believed he was dying asked for the chance to talk to his wife one more time but was denied the suit alleges those officers would not even look at jason in the eye the suit says they just ignored his dying request to comfort ali mahler was taken to the cherokee county sheriffs department office the suit says where until about noon that day she was kept locked in a small room for hours under guard following several days in the hospital kloepfer was placed under arrest for communicating threats and resisting arrest after the shooting sheriff smith  who would later insist publicly that he was not present at the scene walked up from lurking in the shadows the lawsuit says as did chief deputy justin jacobs who smith had also stated was not present they live in fear had kloepfer not had home security video inside his trailer the suit says the details of the shooting may have never come to light in a press release issued the morning of the shooting smith said that it occurred after kloepfer engaged in a verbal altercation with officers and confronted them as he emerged from his camper trailer kloepfer also had outdoor security cameras on his property the suit claims but around midnight ccsd sergeant dennis dore began covering them or turning them to obscure who was on the property and what they were doing after kloepfer published his video jan 18 smith issued a new press release that downplayed the involvement of the agency he oversees he stated  incorrectly according to the lawsuit and supported by public records previously reported by the smoky mountain news  that neither he nor jacobs were on scene and that the information published dec 13 was the result of information provided by the cipd however the criminal charges that had been pressed against kloepfer following the incident werent dropped until march 1 after kloepfer filed subpoenas seeking information to expose the cover up officers involved have not received any consequences whether criminal charges suspensions police changes retraining or internal reprimand the suit says a state bureau of investigations probe into the shooting is ongoing jason and ali lives are forever upended by these events the suit says they live in fear that the powerful government forces will finish the job and murder them to complete the cover up the physical scars on jasons body are obvious but the mental and emotional scars cut even deeper and have not begun to heal kloepfer and mahler have not lived on their cherokee county property since the shooting and have launched a gofundm to cover the higher living expenses that resulted from that decision the lawsuit names a long list of defendants including the eastern band of cherokee indians ohio casualty insurance company and 29 individual members of the cherokee county sheriffs department or cherokee indian police department all in both their individual and official capacities these individuals are sheriff dustin smith chief deputy justin jacobs capt david williams lt milton teasdale lt mitchell morgan lt drew payne sgt dennis dore sgt cody williams det nolan queen deputy jessica stiles deputy jt gray deputy jason hall deputy don latulipe deputy adam erickson and deputy

neil ferguson swat commander scott buttery det sgt jesse ramirez special operations sgt jeff smith det dustin wolfe det cody mckinney special operations officer nathan messer special operations officer andrew sampson and patrol officer chris harris the lawsuit lists 25 counts of action with different combinations of defendants named in each it seeks a jury trial and wants that jury to award

dropped against police shooting victim written by holly kays wednesday march 15 2023 jason harley kloepfer stands at the door with his hands up one second before officers fired photo from kloepfer security video according to a dismissal filed march 1 the charge of communicating threats was dropped at the request of the prosecuting witness on the same day the charge of resisting a public officer was let go upon prosecutorial discretion and the charging document does not list the type of orders given and under what circumstances that this would be a duty of their office the dismissal states the charges were dropped at the discretion of district attorney ashley welch who declined to offer any further comment on the decision the dismissal of kloepfers case came about two weeks after his attorney zeyland mckinney filed six subpoenas monday feb 13 seeking a plethora of documents communications and video related to the case subpoenas issued for cherokee indian police department chief carla neadeau and cipd officers christopher harris nathan messer neil ferguson and andrew sampson as well as cherokee county sheriff dustin smith records sought from both cipd and cherokee county included video from body cams dash cams and the robot that entered kloepfers home as well as policies for use of deadly force and use of body cams the subpoenas also called for any psychological evaluations done on cipd officers prior to dec 14 any mission preplans or afterreports related to the dec 13 response and any documents showing who signed the mutual aid agreement before the raid dec 13 additionally kloepfers attorney asked for text messages between smith and key members of the cipd and cherokee county sheriffs department any texts between cherokee county deputies and the 911 caller and communications between the county and anyone contacted about providing emergency medical service to kloepfer after the shooting subpoenaed parties were given until march 9 to either produce

harrahs cherokee valley river casino and hotel in murphy is abuzz these days as 200 the two misdemeanor charges were the least of kloepfers worries as he left his camper trailer on upper bear paw road in an ambulance dec 13 following an incident that would spawn conflicting narratives and urgent questions about why police took the actions they did kloepfer has posted photosshowing a scar running up the center of his torso from hip level to just below the breastbone with another scar where a bullet struck his right arm no we are not home kloepfer wrote in a feb 13 facebook post we probably will never live there again after that nightmare kloepfer was shot by members of the cipd swat team which the cherokee county sheriffs office called in following an 11 pm 911 call from kloepfers next door neighbor dec 12 the neighbor alleged that kloepfer had been shooting a gun and yelling that he was going to kill the whole neighborhood and she implied that he may have shot his wife or otherwise harmed her cherokee county deputies visited the property soon afterward but didnt see kloepfer and couldnt enter the home without a search warrant the next step was to secure a search warrant and ask for help from the cipd which unlike cherokee county has its own swat team all of this took time to carry out the search warrant was secured at 214 am but not executed until nearly three hours later this was at least in part due to the 70mile drive from cherokee to kloepfers home and to the fact that there was no mutual aid agreement between cherokee county and cipd in effect at the time the previous memorandum of understanding had died with the term of former sheriff derrick palmer who left office a week before the incident if they could contact the sheriff or the highestranking person that they got thats on duty tonight to do that because we got to make sure that were you know covered on the assistance thing cipds swat commander told dispatch before arriving in murphy cherokee county produced the resulting document following a public records request from the smoky mountain news the letter is a formal request that roger neadeau jr of cipd and the cipd swat team be allowed to assist cherokee county at 311 am dec 13 2022 while on duty the letter says these officers are to have the same jurisdiction power rights privileges and immunities as officers of cherokee county  in addition to those the officers normally possess kloepfer and his wife alison mahler smile in a photo taken in 2019jason harley kloepfer facebook photo the letter bears two signatures one from d smith which would be sheriff dustin smith and another difficulttoread signature from somebody representing cipd the presence of smiths signature on the document pairs with statements on radio traffic to show that he was at the sheriffs office that morning however smith has maintained that neither he nor deputy sheriff justin jacobs were present at kloepfers home and that the press release his office published hours after the shooting was based on information provided by the cipd smiths original statementsaid the shooting happened after kloepfer engaged in a verbal altercation with officers and confronted them as he emerged from his camper trailer when kloepfer posted home security videojan 18 that did not show any altercation but did show him standing in the camper door with his hands held high at the moment he was shot smith issued a new statementblaming cipd for the apparently false information contained in the original release dispatch logs show multiple county deputies and investigators were on scene at the time of the shooting in addition to the cipd team smns public records request that yielded a copy of the dec 13 agreement between cherokee county and cipd had sought other documents as well including text messages and emails between various members of the cherokee county sheriffs office and employees of the eastern band of cherokee indians at the time of the incident and in its aftermath after one month and multiple followups from smn the county released the dec 13 agreement along with a letter stating that regarding communications involving the other people listed in your request at this time we are unable to release those records in accordance with north carolina gs 13214 this statute places restrictions on release of investigation records but requires a court order to prevent release of a record that would normally be public it also makes clear that the use of a public record in connection with a criminal investigation or the gathering of criminal intelligence shall not affect its status as a public record the public records law exemption applies to particular criminal incidents not to general information said amanda martin an attorney with the stevens martin vaughn  tadych firm that focuses on first amendment issues so if there are emails discussing an issue as opposed to a particular case those should be public though she chose to drop the charges welch will have another decision to make stemming from the events of dec 13 as is routine when an officer shoots a citizen while on duty the sbi is investigating the incident and will send the resulting report to welch sbi reports never become public but the document will allow welch to decide whether to press criminal charges against any of the law enforcement officers involved

to remove police cameras from tribes public records law written by holly kays friday april 07 2023 d during its april 6 meeting the eastern band of cherokee indians tribal council unanimously approved an ordinance change exempting police car and body cam videos from the tribes public records law the vote comes on the heels of a dec 13 2022 cherokee indian police department swat response in which officers fired at murphy resident jason harley kloepfer after he opened the door to his home with his hands held above his head according to a home security video kloepfer posted jan 18 the ordinance submitted by cherokee indian police department chief carla neadeau  prevents videos from body cams incar cameras and law enforcement surveillance systems from being released under the tribes public records law stating that subjecting them to the public records law is not feasible nor in the public interest after being read and tabled during the march session the ordinance received a motion to pass and a second moments after coming to the floor april 6 before the body could vote cherokee one feather editor robert jumper raised his hand to offer comment jumper said he understood the need to protect police but worried the ordinance as written would block the public from information that it should have a right to know i understand the need for the protection of the pd and our police and i admire their work he said the only question i had was in the state they have a provision that you can go to the court and request the video so i would ask that you consider having that included in the ordinance that thered be some remedy in case the public does need to see a video while body cam footage is exempt from disclosure under the north carolina public records law the statute lays out a process by which a person can seek a court order allowing its release the law has been criticized as throwing up unnecessary roadblocks to transparency but it does provide a pathway for footage to become public  even footage the sheriff in question might prefer to remain hidden tribal code does not appear to have a similar process under questioning from tribal council neadeau said that video would have to be subpoenaed to be released ostensibly this would occur as part of a civil or criminal trial pursuing certain charges or seeking relief on certain claims  not as the result of an individual seeking release of a certain video as a matter of public interest video of the dec 13 shooting had been subpoenaed  but two weeks later criminal charges against kloepfer were dismissed and

haywood county sheriff bill wilke stepped into some big shoes following the latest 2023 a look back marty mcfly award this one goes to cherokee voters who decided in this years election to look back to however in his comments to council attorney general mike mcconnell said that video could be released at the discretion of the chief of police and that the courts could be a recourse for public release this just provides a default position that these things are not automatically released by demand he said chief of police could decide yes this serves a good public purpose or if safety is a paramount concern she can say no its not appropriate at this time somebody still could go to the court and say please let us see this theres a compelling interest for doing so i think the mechanism is available from the ags perspective i think this is the proper route to go mcconnell did not respond to an emailed question asking under what circumstances a court could grant release of a video but did in response to a separate question say that a court could impose restrictions on how footage produced as part of a civil or criminal case is shared members of the cipd swat team shot kloepfer while responding to his home at the request of cherokee county sheriff dustin smith who said he believed his office to be dealing with a potential hostage situation but the camera robot the swat team sent into kloepfers trailer at 5 am showed he and his wifewho he was suspected of harming asleep and unhurt in bed responding to police commands kloepfer came to the door with his hands held above his head  at which point officers fired hitting him twice in his original public statement on the incident smith painted kloepfer as the aggressor writing that officers fired after kloepfer engaged in a verbal altercation and confronted them as he emerged from his camper trailer smith later said he didnt know there were any issues with that version of events until kloepfer posted the video a month later he blamed the cipd for the information in the apparently false initial story in a march 27 letter district attorney ashley welch asked to recuse herself from the case implying that she had initially charged kloepfer based on inaccurate information from smiths office and stating that she was now a witness in the nc state bureau of investigation case as a result of statements to her by smiths office had kloepfer not recorded the entire episode on his home security system the public might have never been the wiser the video clearly showed him holding his hands above his head at the moment he was shot nobody mentioned the shooting during the april 6 discussion in tribal council however and nobody except for jumper expressed concern about placing such a strong barrier to public access of law enforcement recordings the few representatives who offered comment indicated they saw protection for officers as the priority and cited a desire to give neadeau what she wants in this matter on this here i think the chief of police are looking out for their law enforcement officers and thats what we hire them to do said chairman richard french this comes from the chief of police and this is how she wants it everybody on the council anybodys got any objection speak up now or ive got a move on the floor to pass it as it is rep boyd owle said hes received some comments from constituents who want access to certain things the police department does and that nature but said he would ultimately defer to neadeaus wishes i guess thats what she wants shes at the helm of her department there he said turning to neadeau so you are you fine with this yes neadeau replied it doesnt mean that it cant be subpoenaed so as long as its subpoenaed then were fine with that because the camera footage off the body cams shouldnt be public record and it could be a privacy violation but it doesnt mean it cant be subpoenaed tribal council concluded its debate within five minutes and passed the ordinance unanimously with snowbirdcherokee county rep adam wachacha and big cove rep teresa mccoy absent it now goes to principal chief richard sneed who has 30 days to either sign it veto

writing in his resignation letter that the release and statements in it laying out smiths intentions to pursue forming a swat team for cherokee county came as quite a surprise and would come at a high cost minimal use and open the county to tremendous amounts of liability smiths story vs public records contrary to smiths statements in the jan 20 press release public records show that smith did not have to rely on the cipd for an account of what happened dec 13 the cherokee swat team was not alone on scene that night and records indicate that smith and jacobs were closer to the action than smith implied according to call logs and radio traffic at least seven ccso deputies and investigators were at kloepfers home at the time of the shooting radio traffic and smiths signature on a mutual assistance agreement signed prior to the swat response show that smith was at the sheriffs office when the swat team arrived in murphy and a radio exchange between smith and captain david williams indicates he was even closer to the scene than that when the shooting occurred in the exchange which takes places after the shooting williams tells smith identified as by his call number 401 that one of the tribal units is asking that smith stand by i think theyre wanting to follow you back to 400 he said referencing the sheriffs office if we have anything up there maybe some drinks or anything they could unwind a little bit williams adds i dont know what we got available but theyre welcome to anything in my office 104 smith responds ill take care of it later in the recording of law enforcement communications that night dispatch receives a call from a man whose name is redacted the person is trying to get in touch with ccso investigator paul fry who wasnt dispatched to the scene until after the shooting occurred i talked to david williams who said that the chief deputy was going up with the person who go shot the caller asks the person seems unfamiliar with ccsos personnel asking whether paul fry is the chief deputy no hes an investigator the dispatcher says who went with the person who got shot the caller asks was it the chief deputy or was it paul fry im not sure to be honest with you the dispatcher replies cipd wants tighter body cam release laws thus far both ccso and cipd have remained tightlipped about the incident with smith consistently ignoring requests for comment and cipd chief carla neadeau declining to comment citing the ongoing sbi investigation kloepfers home video is the only video from that night that has been released to the public thus far in subpoenas filed in relation to the nowdropped criminal case kloepfer sought body and dash cam video from both law enforcement agencies as well as video from the robot initially sent into his house the case was dropped before those subpoenas could be executed and neadeau has proposed tribal legislation that would make it even more difficult to obtain that video evidence the ordinance which was read into the record during the march 2 tribal council session and can be considered for passage april 6 would exempt police records from release under the tribes public records law the measure would apply to body cams incar cameras and law enforcement surveillance camera systems according to the proposed legislation the tribe is beginning to employ body cams and dash cams but its public records law was written before these technologies became commonplace in cherokee the public records law itself is only marginally useful for area journalists in the past the smoky mountain news has been denied requests made under the tribes public records law and told the law applies only to tribal members it is not feasible nor in the public interest to subject recordings made by bodyworn and incar cameras to the ebcis public records law the document says adding that the ordinance change does not limit individuals ability to access these recordings through other provisions of the cherokee code such as discovery in a criminal or civil action state law which applies to ccso but not cipd already exempts such recordings from the state public records law and allows their release only following a court order civil case likely welchs march 27 letter came just one day before kloepfer released a second video related to the shooting this one he said showed sbi officers investigating the scene at his home the morning afterward the threeminute 32second video includes a clip from the 911 call that prompted the response and three short clips of the sbi officers in the first one starting at 1142 am dec 13 an officer asks his colleagues what kloepfer had been charged with did they shoot at him then they went and got a warrant the same officer says accompanied by a laugh of apparent disbelief in the second clip at 1144 am in the third clip at 1218 pm the officers spot kloepfers camera and take it off the wall kloepfer wrote on facebook that he and his wife ali mahler have been living out of state since the shooting for multiple reasons the biggest one of which is fear of being murdered in a letter linked on a gofundme page raising money for housing medical bills and other living expenses kloepfer and mahler said that living away from home costs about five times as much as it did to live on their property in cherokee county and that neither of them is able to work  mahler because of mental and emotional fallout from the attack and kloepfer due to disability from a 2014 injury in which he intervened to save a single mom and her kids causing a gang member to shoot him resulting in paralysis being a fighter and with my faithful support jason rose from the wheelchair and found his ability to walk again the letter says still his injuries have been a constant uphill battle it took jason nine years to finally learn to walk again and he still uses a cane often mahler and kloepfer wrote that they may never feel safe again and that horrendous flashbacks to what happened and what could have happened dec 13 cripple us for hours kloepfer has not filed any lawsuit related to the dec 13 shooting but the letter implies such action is coming these things can take a long time a civil case may take three to four years it says we are prepared to do battle and fight for justice until the end no matter how long it takes share hipps steps down as haywood chamber
