The principal objective of the flag-waving cruise was to thank the people of New Zealand for funding the construction of the battlecruiser  for the Royal Navy.\n\nBackground\nIn March 1909 the government of New Zealand offered to fund the construction of a battleship for the Royal Navy. This offer was subsequently changed at the suggestion of the Admiralty to a battlecruiser, whose keel was laid down in June 1910. By October 1912  was beginning her sea trials prior to acceptance in the Royal Navy. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 19 November 1912.\n\nAfter the first proposals were made in 1912 for the ship to visit its donor country there was considerable discussion over its duration before a basic nine-month-long itinerary was finalized in the last months of 1912. \n\nThe cruise would take in South Africa as passage via the Suez Canal was ruled out of consideration due to a general instruction from the hydrography department of the Admiralty that ships navigating the canal had to draw not more than . It was not until May 1913 as a result of loading and trim experiments with  that the necessary calculations were completed for members of the  to be issued with a canal certification.\n\nTo facilitate the flag-waving cruise New Zealand was temporarily detached from the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron on 20 January 1913 for the duration of the voyage with Halsey having independent command. The initial date of departure progressively moved backward into 1913 with the ship finally departing the Royal Navy dockyard at Devonport on 28 January for Portsmouth, which it reached two days later.\n\nPrior to her departure the battlecruiser was visited by King George V (accompanied by Winston Churchill, Sir John Jellicoe, Sir Thomas Mackenzie, Sir Joseph Ward, James Allen (New Zealand's Minister of Finance and Defence) and a number of other high–ranking officials on 5 February 1913.\n\nThe voyage\nAs soon as the King’s party had departed New Zealand took on 800 tons of coal before departing Portsmouth on 6 February. As the battlecruiser headed south it took on coal at St Vincent on 13 February and later at Ascension Island before arriving in Cape Town on 28 February. After further stops at Simon's Town and Durban in South Africa she reached Melbourne, Australia on 2 April to be greeted by the cruiser , destroyers , , , gunboats  and .  \n\nThe voyage from Durham had consumed 8,000 tons of coal, leaving only eight tons in her bunkers, though her reserve of 650 tons of oil fuel was still intact.  Therefore 3,000 tons of coal transported by the collier Katoa from Westport were soon taken on board, a task which took 20 hours and employed 750 of the crew. With the coal on board the ship now drew too much water to brief alongside a pier so remained moored off Gellibrand Pile lighthouse, where as well as official visitors, some 300 New Zealanders resident in Australia were ferried out to visit her.\n\nNew Zealand\nNew Zealand reached Wellington in New Zealand on 12 April where over the course of her stay in the capital 98,170 citizens visited her, being conveyed out to where she was moored in the harbour by a fleet of steamers.  This was the start of an event that gripped the country as thousands of New Zealanders came to catch a sight of and where possible visit \"our Dreadnought.\" For the ship's crew this meant having to attend a constant parade of events and festivities. The ship's detailed itinerary in New Zealand was overseen by Francis Henry Dillon Bell, Minister of Internal Affairs and acting Minister of Marine. The government cable ship Tutanekai was allocated to accompany the battlecruiser around the country and transport people out to the battlecruiser if it drew too deep a draught to dock or safely anchor.\n \nNew Zealand departed Wellington on 23 April and proceeded up the east coast of the North Island to visit Napier (25–26 April), Gisborne (27–28 April) and Auckland (29 April–9 May). The battlecruiser then streamed south to visit Lyttelton (13–22 May), Akaroa (24–26 May), where she exercised with  before continuing on to Timaru (29 May), with a planned stop at Oamaru abandoned due to strong winds. The battlecruiser was too big to safely enter Otago harbour, so it moored at Otago Heads (31 May–1 June).  Despite being the harbour of the country’s fourth largest city a strong swell restricted the number of visitors that could board the ship to 3,306. During this stop Halsey was able to travel north by car to Oamaru to unveil a memorial to his friend Robert Falcon Scott. Leaving Otago behind the battlecruiser rounded the South Island visiting Bluff (3 June), Milford Sound (4 June), Greymouth (5–6 June), Westport (7 June), Nelson (8–9 June), Picton (10 June), before stopping again at Wellington and proceeding up the West Coast of the North Island visiting Wanganui (16 June), Russell (19–20 June) and back to Auckland (21–28 June).\n\nThe battlecruiser received numerous gifts while in New Zealand. Of particular note were the gift of two greenstone hei-tiki (pendants), which were intended to ward off evil. and the personal gift to Halsey of a Māori piupiu (a warrior's skirt made from rolled flax).\n\nThe ship suffered from a number of desertions while in New Zealand with several absconding while it was in Wellington and another ten absconding in May while it was visiting Auckland. After burning their uniforms two of the Auckland deserters, Edward Waterson and Melvin Reid, found employment as farmhands at Manurewa before they were captured three months later. They then sued the farmer for not paying them each their owed £16 in wages only for the magistrate to dismiss the claim as he felt it was not the courts responsibility to assist deserters.\n\nBy the time the battlecruiser departed New Zealand from Auckland at 15:00 on 28 June for Fiji, a total of 376,114 New Zealanders. had visited the vessel during her time in the country, while other sources quote 376,086, 368,118. and 378,068. This number would have been far greater had it not been for the poor weather and heavy seas at many of the roadstead ports that the ship visited which made it difficult for New Zealanders to board the ship. It is estimated that approximately another 125,000 had been able to see the ship either from the shore or from boats. At the time the country had a population of one million. \nTo date the battlecruiser had been 85 days at sea, had steamed , and had taken on 16,613 tons of coal over the course of nine coaling operations.\n\nThe Americas\nThe battlecruiser reached Suva in Fiji on 1 July and after a five day stay departed northwards across the Pacific to arrival in Honolulu on 12 July, where 1,930 tons of coal and 289 tons of fuel oil were taken on board to fuel the journey to Canada which was reached on 23 July upon docking at the naval base of Esquimalt on Vancouver Island. While in Canada New Zealand participated in a regatta attended by the ships of the US Navy. However, the regatta was marred by the death of an aviator named Bryan when he fell  to his death after his aircraft broke up during strong winds.\n\nDeparting Vancouver on 9 August New Zealand stopped on her way south at Mazatlán (16–18 August) where some 600 Mexicans toured the ship, Acapulco (21–22 August), Salina Cruz (23–25 August), Panama City (reached on 19 August), before reaching Callao in Peru on 8 September. \n\nNew Zealand was to spend two months in South America. Wright has identified that the United Kingdom had attached significant importance to this leg of the voyage as it would display the country's naval technology, which had the potential to generate arms sales to Argentina, Brazil and Chile where British shipbuilders were competing against German and the American rivals to equipment their navies.\n \nThe next stop Valparaíso was reached on 17 September, then Punta Arenas, before she steamed through the Strait of Magellan and on to Montevideo (3–7 October), Rio de Janeiro (11 October), Trinidad (reached on 27 October, where she was the first warship which have ever taken oil from Trinidad onboard), Dominica (reached on 3 November), Jamaica, Grenada, Bermuda (13–18 November) and finally Halifax, Nova Scotia (21–30 November) before sailing across the Atlantic, to arrive in Portsmouth on 8 December 1913.\n\nNew Zealand had sailed , consumed 31,833 tons of coal and had been visited by 500,151 people, having completed what was to date the longest voyage by a vessel of the dreadnought era. As well as gaining valuable operational experience through the tour the officers attended 75 dances and were made members of 150 clubs.\n\nThe voyage was judged such a success that Halsey was knighted for his efforts.\n\nSecond circumnavigation\nNew Zealand completed a second circumnavigation between 31 February 1919 and 3 February 1920 when it was used to transport Admiral John Jellicoe on his review of the naval defences of India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. This voyage was considerably shorted at  as it used the Panama Canal to transit between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\nThe next circumnavigation by a capital ship of the Royal Navy was that by , , and the rest of the Special Service Squadron in 1923–24.\n\nSee also\n List of circumnavigations\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Auckland's Reception to the Battleship HMS New Zealand.
