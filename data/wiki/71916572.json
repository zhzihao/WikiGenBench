BCGFs specifically mediate the growth and division of B cells, or, in other words, the progression of B cells through their life cycle (cell cycle stages G1, S, G2). BCDFs control the advancement of a B cell progenitor or unmatured B cell to an adult immunoglobulin (Ig) secreting cell. Differentiation factors control cell fate and can sometimes cause matured cells to change lineage. Not all currently known BCGFs and BCDFs affect all B cell lineages and stages of the cell cycle in similar ways. Both BCGFs and BCDFs work on cells previously \"activated\" by factors such as anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig). BCGFs cause activated B cells to enlarge, express activation markers (ex. transferrin receptor) and enter the S phase (DNA synthesis phase) of the cell cycle. Meanwhile, BCDFs stimulate these cells to differentiate to mature Ig-secreting B cells. \n\nAn important note is that B cell Proliferation Factors (BCPFs) also exist and are different from BCGFs. BCPFs make cells, which are not necessarily activated, more responsive to BCGFs and help maintain cell viability, whereas BCGFs direct and stimulate growth and division. This article will mention BCPFs and factors that induce proliferation, yet the main focus will remain on BCGFs and BCDFs.\n\nGeneral Overview \nThe currently known BCGFs and BCDFs are BCGF I (also called B cell Stimulating Factor 1 (BSF1)), BCGF II, BCDF, IL-1 (interleukin-1), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 (BSF-2), IFN-alpha, beta 2, and gamma, neuroleukin, TGF-beta (Transforming Growth Factor-beta), LP1 (Lymphopoetin 1), BCGFLOW, TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha), TRF (T cell Replacing Factor), CSF (colony-stimulating factors),  MAF (macrophage activation factors), and lymphotoxin. Most factors act in many points throughout the B cell lifecycle, activation, growth, differentiation, and maturation, making this a complex pathway for study. Provided here is a list of these with some more detailed descriptions about their origins and functions.\n\nBCGF I (BSF1 or BSFp1) - secreted by activated T cells. BCGF I induces \"resting\" cells to become susceptible to stimulation by ligands. Both anti-Ig and BCGF I are required for a cell to enter S and G2 phase. It is not clear if BCGF I acts on memory B cells specifically, but it appears to induce growth in the continuous presence of anti-Ig in all other lineages. BCGF is uninhibited by anti-Tac (T cell activation antigen), whereas other factors, such as IL-2 are. \n\nBCGF II - a cytokine secreted by T cells.\n\nBCDF - causes calcium influx in cells, critical for differentiation. It is the only factor which can achieve this effect. Induces differentiation in late-stage activated cells. BCDF subclasses are associated with the secretion of specific subclasses of Ig, for example BCDF(γ) with IgG and BCDF(μ) with IgM.\n\nIL-1 - a cytokine derived from macrophages, this factor drives cells into S phase, usually working after BCGF I. IL-1 weakly co-stimulates even resting B cells in the presence of anti-Ig and can enhance BCDF function. \n\nIL-2 - a cytokine key activating factor for T cells and B cells secreted by T cells. Cells in early-stage activation differentiate in response to IL-2 and all B cells proliferate in the presence of IL-2. IL-2 exhibits an additive affect to BCGF when both are present. Yet the magnitude of its effect is much less than BCGF and BCDF in both growth and differentiation. \n\nIL-3 - cytokine associated with the differentiation of more mature B cells. \n\nIL-4 - cytokine associated with the differentiation of mature T cells, which some B cell precursors are also responsive to.\n\nIL-5 - cytokine that acts like IL-6, except it can also induce proliferation in B cells, and its effect on differentiation is partially inhibited by IL-4. IL-5 cannot induce differentiation in cells activated by anti-Ig.\n\nIL-6 (BSF-2) - cytokine that acts exclusively as a B cell differentiation factor, stimulating increase in levels of Ig, J-chain mRNA, and proteins.\n\nIFN-alpha, beta 2, and gamma (interferons alpha, beta 2, and gamma) - IFN-gamma in combination with IL-2 also induces early-stage differentiation. Interferon-gamma has previously been reported as a requirement for plaque-forming cell response. Interferon-alpha can either enhance or suppress differentiation by controlling responsiveness of human peripheral blood B cells to B-cell helper factors, depending on certain environment and context-specific conditions, as its signaling is likely mediated by other cell types. \n\nNeuroleukin \n\nTGF-beta \n\nLP1 - a growth factor active in the development of immature B cells and capable of stimulating proliferation of B cell precursors.\n\nBCGFLOW \n\nTNF-alpha \n\nTRF - induced primarily IgM secretion from B cells, thus constituting a differentiation factor. Various sources disagree as to whether TRF can induce proliferation.\n\nCSF \n\nMAF \n\nLymphotoxin\n\nDiscovery \nThe identification and classification of B cell growth and differentiation factors was primarily conducted in the 1980s-1990s, though it had begun to spark interest of the scientific community in the 1970s. It began with the creation of T cell hybridomas - immortal cells that could be selected to produce only one factor. This allowed the study of B cells exposed to only one soluble factor at a time, enabling the identification of that factor's direct effects on the cells. Previously, it was believed that B cell growth was induced exclusively by the presence of antigen. Some major questions that researchers attempted to answer were which cells and specifically cell types secreted these factors, and in which conditions, as well as if and how these factors differed from T Cell Growth and Differentiation Factors (TCGFs and TCDFs) such as IL-2. Additionally, it was established early on that several compounds could mediate B cell growth and differentiation, some of them working only when encountered together (synergistically). So, researchers also attempted to identify how many BCGFs and BCDFs exist and classify the varieties of these factors.  \n\nA major early challenge was the inability of culturing one distinctive T cell line or the isolation of thereof to analyze its effects. T cell factors that induced B cell activation, proliferation, growth, and differentiation were frequently generated by mixed populations of T cells. When the first immortalized T cell lines began to emerge, it became possible to observe which T cells had specific effects on B cells. Various T cell types secreted factors that induced Ig production, in some cases only of specific kinds or only in the presence of antigen. Some IgG classes secreted by B cells are exclusively T cell dependent.  \n\nAnother major advance was the declaration that BCGF and BCDF were indeed two different entities. It was determined that T cell secreted factors and anti-Ig were necessary for the proliferation of activated B cells, while the addition of a differentiation factor was required to induce Ig production (ie. differentiation). So, it was determined that these two factors were separate entities. Isolating the two types of BCGF and BCDF was difficult as it required purification from IL-2. A key difference between the two variants of BCGF was that only one could induce growth in colony-forming B cells.  \n\nLater, difficulties with the subject B cell populations began to emerge, as there wasn't yet a stable long-term method of culture or isolation of individual subtypes. The difficulty of obtaining populations of viable B cell precursors was resolved by the design of a long-term bone marrow culture system, which secreted LP1 growth factor. In given populations, it was determined that B cells could be sorted into groups of \"activated\" and \"resting\" cells by their size, enabling the study of factors on these two distinct subgroups. As not all cell lines responded to the factors listed in the above section in similar ways (and some were completely irresponsive), a model cell line that could respond to various factors was necessary to compare the resulting responses and study in more detail the pathways of each lymphokine or factor's signal. Researchers identified several such cell lines that were guaranteed to have receptors for or respond to groups of factors. For example, in CH12 B cell lymphoma, cells differentiate in response to both IL-5 and IL-6 in the presence of other costimulatory cytokines, while in other cell lines IL-5 is only effective in a narrow window of time right after activation. \n\nBCGFs and BCDFs were originally sought after for research purposes. Previously identified similar factors for T cells allowed T cells to be \"immortalized\" or kept alive in the research setting for prolonged periods of time. This permitted the extensive study of T cells and their functioning. It also permitted the modelling of the immune response, such as studying the activated T cell state. Finding factors that would enable a similar closer study of B cells would greatly benefit science.\n\nB cell differentiation pathways \nThe most common simplified overview description of the B cell differentiation pathway involves the following steps: an antigen interacts with the corresponding surface membrane immunoglobulin after which the B cell begins expressing receptors for growth factors secreted by T cells (BCGFs and IL-2), after these factors bind, the lymphocytes enter S phase, and subsequent binding with BCDFs differentiates B cells into Ig secreting cells. This model quickly grows more complex as individual resting B cells receive multiple varying sequential signals that determine future cell fate and functions that will be performed by those cells. Depending on this sequence of BCDFs, B cells may achieve different \"fates\" which can constitute the types of Ig they secrete or even their destiny with a specialized lineage (such as Memory B cells or plasma cells).\n\nFurther investigations have been conducted since the identification of BCGFs and BCDF to determine what receptors they bind to and outline their pathways. There is evidence that CD23 is the receptor for BCDF. It was concluded that neither BCGF nor BCDF shared a receptor with IL-2. At least one pathway of B cell maturation via 446-BCDF, derived from anti-CD3 peripheral blood T cells, may involve reduction of intracellular cAMP. Stimulation by 446-BCDF causes an influx of calcium.\n\nImmune system interactions \nBCGFs and BCDFs primarily travel through the body intravenously but tend to be more concentrated in sites most critical to the human immune system - the lymph nodes, thyroid, spleen, bone marrow, and liver. The environments in all of these areas are complex ecosystems of various cell types, states, and concentrations of factors. So, in general, B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation appears to be a complex process dependent on many cell and factor interactions as well as the state of activation of the cell.\n\nThe interconnected nature of the immune system has caused many complications, for when looking at cells in model systems, it has often been unclear which, if any, factor actually exerted their effects directly on the B cells themselves as opposed to acting via accessory cells or in conjunction with other factors.\n\nRelated diseases \nCommon diseases associated with the dysregulation of B cells are autoimmunity, immune deficiency, and various blood-associated cancers. BCGFs and BCDFs are associated with these diseases because they control crucial parts of the B cell life cycle - the cell's growth and identity. For example, if BCGFs are present at an extremely high concentration, cells may multiply very quickly exhibiting cancer-like behavior or extreme levels of immune response. Similarly, extreme differentiation towards a specific lineage may make the immune system weakened in some areas or too powerful and cause immune-related disease.  \n\nDifferent lineages or states of T cells secrete various BCDF subgroups. Maintaining the balance of the number and proportion of these cells is critical, as deficiencies in one or more subgroups cause disease, such as common variable immunodeficiency and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. \n\nDysregulation of growth factor production is a characteristic of some diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and traumatic joint injury, where high levels of BCDF and IL-2 are present in the synovial fluid, resulting in increased differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells and Ig secreting cells that secrete so many antibodies that they generate an immune response and inflammation in locations where they accumulate.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGrowth factors", "unikey": "B cell growth and differentiation factors", "summary": "B Cell Growth and Differentiation Factors (also known as BCGF and BCDF) are two important groups of soluble factors controlling the life cycle of B cells (also referred to as B lymphocytes, cells which perform functions including: antibody secretion, antigen presentation, preservation of memory for antigens, and lymphokine secretion[1]).

available as recombinant gene products and will not be discussed recent work with these factors especially il4 has revealed a remarkable diversity of function most of them seem able to act at more than one stage of b cell activation proliferation and differentiation thus invalidating the concept of a single unique factor controlling each discrete step of normal b cell responses in addition these factors are not b cell specific but have a wide range of cell types as targets the functional diversity of these factors has important implications for their potential as therapeutic agents and

cells stimulated with low concentrations of antimu antibody was investigated recombinant il2 was capable of augmenting the proliferative response of antimuactivated b cells and the t cell activation tac antigen was expressed on a substantial proportion of normal b cells stimulated with antimu antibody however crude supernatants from protein astimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells which were found to possess both il2 and b cell growth factor bcgf activities maintained the ability to promote proliferation of antimuactivated b cells after depletion of il2 in addition supernatants from some t cell clones apparently free of il2 activity displayed strong bcgf activity in the costimulation assay with antimu antibody this bcgf activity was found in 25 kda fractions by gel filtration and it was unaffected by addition to the cultures of antitac antibody which consistently inhibited the b cell proliferative response promoted by recombinant il2 the proliferative response of antimuactivated b cells to clonal il2free supernatants containing bcgf and recombinant il2 present together from the beginning of culture was close to the sum of responses to the two stimulants separately in addition the presence of clonal supernatant containing bcgf from the beginning of culture had a synergistic effect in the response of activated b cells to the subsequent addition of il2 whereas the initial presence of il2 had no such an effect on the reactivity of antimustimulated b cells to the late addition of clonal supernatant containing bcgf the synergistic effect of bcgf in the il2promoted b cell proliferation was probably the result of the recruitment of a greater number of il2reactive b cells in fact the number of tacpositive cells was significantly higher in 36h cultures established in the presence of antimu antibody plus clonal supernatant containing bcgf than in cultures stimulated with antimu antibody alone taken together these data indicate that antimu antibody promotes the expression by normal human b cells of distinct receptors for il2 and a bcgf distinct from il2 they also suggest that bcgf can exert a synergistic effect in the il2promoted proliferation

combination to human b cells by activating purified human b cells with staphylococcus aureus cowan i sac for 3 days separating b blast cells by the percoll centrifugation method and then either using these b blast cells as b cells in the earlier stage after sacactivation or further culturing these b blast cells for 4 more days without any stimuli and using these b cells as b cells in the later stage after sacactivation we could define two different populations of cells disparity in the populations could be demonstrated by the observation that b cells in the earlier stage were 812 tacantigen 232 b2 689 transferrin receptor and 905 hlrdr whereas b cells in the later stage were observed to be less positive for each surface antigen 361 tacag 83 b2 453 transferrin receptor and 587 hlrdr by adding each factor to both b cell fractions we also demonstrated functional differences in the two populations b cells in the earlier stage of activation only differentiated in response to il 2 or il 2  ifngamma but not to bcdf which was in contrast to b cells in the later stage that did not differentiate in response to il 2 but did differentiate to bcdf however b cells in both stages proliferated in response to il 2 but not to bcdf finally we separated b cells in the later stage into two populations by the percoll discontinuous gradient centrifugation lower density larger b cells were observed to proliferate but not to differentiate in response to il 2 whereas higher density smaller b cells were observed to differentiate in response to bcdf therefore we conclude that activated b cells initially become large and gain tacag and differentiate in response to il 2 alone as well as the combination of il 2 and ifngamma whereas later in the more mature stage they become smaller again and

cytokines have been demonstrated to affect bcell function however it is unclear which of these mediators actually exert direct effects on the b cells themselves in the present study the direct role of interleukin il 1 il2 interferongamma or interferonalpha in human bcell activation proliferation or differentiation was examined and compared with the effects of a bcell growth factor bcgf or a bcell differentiation factor bcdf highly purified human b lymphocytes were separated according to size into two nonoverlapping populations the fraction of small b cells was incubated with il1 il2 interferongamma interferonalpha bcgf or bcdf and cell size changes rna synthesis dna synthesis or supernatant immunoglobulin ig production were measured neither il1 il2 interferonalpha interferongamma nor the bcgf induced substantial cell size changes rna synthesis dna synthesis or ig production by the small fraction of b lymphocytes however the bcdf could directly activate a proportion of resting b lymphocytes to secrete ig the fraction of large b cells was also incubated with these cytokines while neither il1 interferonalpha nor interferongamma enhanced dna synthesis or ig production by the fraction of large b lymphocytes dna synthesis was augmented 23fold by bcgf and igg production was increased 7fold by bcdf additionally il2 slightly enhanced both proliferation and differentiation of large b cells but substantially less so than bcgf and bcdf dna synthesis was increased 4fold while ig production in the presence of il2 was increased by approximately 50 thus the most important lymphokines modulating the function of these two fractions of tonsillar lymphocytes were a bcgf and a bcdf pubmed disclaimer similar articles the effects of interleukin1 interleukin2 alphainterferon

disclaimerdepartment of immunology duke university medical center durham north carolina 27710pmc copyright notice abstractinterleukin5 il5 and il6 have both been reported to act as bcell differentiation factors by stimulating activated b cells to secrete antibody however it has not been possible to directly compare the effects of these two lymphokines because of the lack of a suitable bcell line capable of responding to both we have identified a clonal inducible bcell lymphoma ch12 that has this property both il5 and il6 can independently stimulate increases in steadystate levels of immunoglobulin and jchain mrna and proteins and they both induce the differentiation of ch12 into highrate antibodysecreting cells nevertheless there are significant differences in the activities of these two lymphokines first while il6 acts only as a differentiation factor il5 also augments the proliferation of ch12 cells second the differentiation stimulated by il5 but not by il6 is partially inhibited by il4 inhibition of il5induced differentiation was not at the level of il5 receptor expression since il4 did not inhibit il5induced proliferation third il5 but not il6 stimulated increased mouse mammary tumor proviral gene expression in ch12 cells these results demonstrate that while both il5 and il6 may act as differentiation factors for b cells they induce differentiation by using at least partially distinct molecular pathways our results also establish that b cells characteristic of a single stage of development can independently respond to il4 il5 and il6full textfull
