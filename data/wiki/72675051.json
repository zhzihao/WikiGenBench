summerbarry chinglobe staffthe massachusetts house on tuesday declared democrat margaret scarsdale the winner in a razorthin race for state representative accepting the recommendation of a special legislative committee after it found that while local election officials made missteps they did not impact the final sevenvote marginscarsdale is scheduled to be sworn in wednesday exactly two weeks after nearly every representativeelect had taken the oath of office according to a house aide the pepperell democrat  who defeated republican andrew shepherd in a race that had gone to a recount  will officially fill the first middlesex seat that until last year had been held for nearly four decades by the gopadvertisementthe threeperson committees report issued late tuesday does not completely settle the chambers membership however it is still reviewing another race in the second essex district where legislative leaders had also delayed the swearingin of kristin kassner a hamilton democrat who after a recount emerged by a single vote over the republican incumbent lenny mirramirra had challenged his onevote loss in court and had asked a judge to review at least two ballots  both of which mirra said elections workers had determined to be cast for him but were later ruled as blank ballots a superior court judge later dismissed the suit and an appellate court judge rejected mirras request for an injunctionmirra told the special committee in testimony on friday that he does not believe there was any massive fraud in his election but charged there was human error including he contended when more than a dozen ballots were found and counted during the recount without explanationits unclear when the committee could issue a report on that race a committee aide said tuesday that it remains under advisementhouse speaker ron marianos decision not to immediately seat scarsdale and kassner had sparked fissures in the state democratic party where some activists fretted that the quincy democrat was feeding into election denialism one local democratic group went as far as to call the speakers decision a blow to democracyadvertisementin the first middlesex race the special legislative committee said there were minor missteps by local officials including in one community where incorrect ballots were sent to some voters in another it said it appears possible that 50 test ballots were inadvertently included during the recount with actual ballots cast while in another town uncast ballots were apparently included in the tally of blank ballots as a simple way of accounting for those uncast ballotsshepherd like mirra did not contend there was fraud in his race saying it wasnt stolen  its just excruciatingly close but the committee concluded that the townsend republican failed to provide any corroborating evidence to support his claims that the irregularities that occurred    caused harm beyond pure speculationwhile these missteps had no impact on the integrity or the final outcome of the committee was willing to listen as we presented significant errors that came about during this election cycle he said in a statementscarsdale said in a statement that she was grateful for the committees expeditious review and their attention to this critical processi am eager and ready to get down to business serving the hardworking people of the first
