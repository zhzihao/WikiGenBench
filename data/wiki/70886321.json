{"id": 70886321, "key": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%20Wars%20Jedi%3A%20Survivor", "text": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a 2023 action-adventure soulslike video game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (2019), taking place five years after the events of the previous game and continues the adventure of young Jedi Knight, Cal Kestis, as he and his friends continue in their struggle to survive the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The game was released for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S on April 28, 2023. It received generally positive reviews from critics, though the PC version received criticism for technical issues.\n\nGameplay \nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor retains many of the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor and introduces new elements. In lightsaber combat, Cal Kestis has access to five different lightsaber types, each with unique features. He can use the single blade and double blade stances from the previous game, Fallen Order, and the special dual-wield blade attack is expanded into its own stance. The dual-wield stance was originally intended to be a playable stance in Fallen Order, but it was only included as a special attack due to time constraints. A new stance has also been added that uses a Kylo Ren-style crossguard lightsaber, which requires players to pay attention to timing windows to use effectively, particularly when blocking and parrying enemy attacks. The second new stance is the blaster stance which allows the player to use a lightsaber and blaster combo allowing for both close and ranged attacks. These different stances are designed to be used to combat specific types of enemies, which game director Stig Asmussen says will make the player \"figure out what the best weapon of choice is\". A new Force stasis ability, similar to the one used by Kylo Ren in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, allows the player to freeze enemies and blaster bolts mid-air. Player cosmetic customization options have been greatly expanded in Survivor over the limited options available in Fallen Order. Survivor allows the player to customize Cal's entire outfit, along with his hairstyle and facial hair. A white blade is a new color option in lightsaber customization.\n\nThe level design of Jedi: Survivor features larger, more expansive maps populated with more non-player characters compared to Fallen Order. Lead level designer Martin Badowsky said that Respawn wanted Koboh to feature a dense central area with more open outskirts areas as the player explores outwards. In addition, the Mantis landing pads have been moved to more central locations on planets to provide easier access to the various regions. The planet Koboh has been described as a \"home away from home\" that the player will revisit throughout the game, and with each revisit, new pathways will open up. Design director Jeff Magers said that \"By exploring the worlds, players will both make Cal more their own through customization\" and many of the optional areas contain skills, upgrades and perks that will make Cal \"more powerful and equipped to take on the challenges ahead\". By comparison, revisiting planets like Bogano in Fallen Order was done primarily in service of progressing the plot rather than for encouraging exploration. Exploration is made easier in Survivor with the addition of fast travel at meditation points where the player can be quickly transported to another meditation point on the planet that they have already discovered. However, Respawn wanted to ensure that using fast travel was not necessary to ordinarily traverse the environment or to complete the story. Fast travel was absent in Fallen Order and was a much-requested feature. Scattered throughout Koboh are seven High Republic-era Jedi Chambers for the player to discover. Jedi Meditation Chambers feature puzzles and challenges for the player to complete and provide rewards such as perks or skill points for the player to upgrade their abilities. Jedi Chambers become available once the player has rescued Zee from the Chamber of Duality.\n\nSynopsis\n\nSetting and characters\n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor takes place five years after the events of Fallen Order. The game follows Jedi Knight Cal Kestis (Cameron Monaghan) as he fights the Empire while searching for a place to hide from them. Cal's allies include: Jedi Master Cere Junda (Debra Wilson); former pilot of the Stinger Mantis Greez Dritus (Daniel Roebuck), BD-1 (Ben Burtt), a small droid; Merrin (Tina Ivlev), one of the last surviving members of the Nightsister clan of Dathomir; and Bode Akuna (Noshir Dalal), a Rebel fighting for the safety of his daughter Kata (Tajinae Turner). Other characters include Jedi Master Eno Cordova (Tony Amendola), BD-1's former owner, now helping Cere recover the Jedi Archive; and ZN-A4 (Kendal Rae), a droid from the High Republic Era formerly owned by Jedi Master Santari Khri (Tracy Ifeachor).\n\nCal fights many enemies during his journey, such as the Pau'an Senator Daho Sejan (T. J. Ramini); Imperial Commander Lank Denvik (Gideon Emery); the Ninth Sister (Misty Lee); who is trained by the Sith Lord Darth Vader (Scott Lawrence) as part of the Imperial Inquisitors program; High Republic Dark Jedi Dagan Gera (Cody Fern), who seeks to reach Tanalorr; and his right hand man: the Gen'Dai Rayvis (D. C. Douglas), the leader of the Bedlam Raiders. Temuera Morrison voices Boba Fett, having portrayed the character several times previously.\n\nPlot \nFive years after destroying the Jedi Holocron, Jedi Knight Cal Kestis has parted ways with Cere Junda, Greez Dritus, and Merrin to continue his battle against the Empire as a resistance fighter working under Saw Gerrera. His latest mission has him teaming up with his mercenary friend Bode Akuna to infiltrate the Imperial capital world of Coruscant and steal valuable military data from Senator Daho Sejan. After Cal retrieves the data from Sejan, the Ninth Sister, who survived her defeat on Kashyyyk, arrives to confront and exact revenge on Cal, slaughtering Sejan and almost all of Cal's team except Bode and Bravo. Cal fights and kills the Ninth Sister before escaping Coruscant with Bode, Bravo is killed during the escape. Cal is disheartened to learn from the data that despite all his efforts, the Empire has become more powerful, expanding its reach farther through the galaxy. \n\nWith the Stinger Mantis damaged during his escape from Coruscant, Cal decides to seek out Greez, who resides on the remote planet of Koboh, to see if he can repair the damages. Subsequently, after surviving a crash landing on the planet's surface, Cal finds the local population menaced by a criminal organization known as the Bedlam Raiders, led by an armored Gen'dai named Rayvis. Cal reunites with Greez, who directs him to a cave containing the parts needed to repair the Mantis. \n\nWhile exploring, Cal comes across ZN-A4 or \"Zee,\" a droid that served the Jedi Order during the High Republic era. Zee gives Cal a High Republic tuner device and tells him she was ordered to activate a device called the Forest Array hundreds of years ago but became trapped in the caves. After freeing her, Cal travels to the Array, where he senses Force visions of two High Republic Jedi, Dagan Gera and Santari Khri, who discovered the mythical planet of Tanalorr hidden behind the supposedly impassable Koboh Abyss nebula. Cal activates the Array and discovers Dagan suspended in a bacta tank. Cal frees Dagan in hopes of recruiting a fellow Jedi but discovers that Dagan has fallen to the dark side of the Force, angry at the Jedi Order for having abandoned Tanalorr. Dagan fights and is defeated by Cal before escaping with the help of Rayvis and the Bedlam Raiders. \n\nRealizing the value of a planet inaccessible to the Empire, Cal, Bode, and Greez repair the Stinger Mantis and head for the planet Jedha, where Cere has been working with Merrin and a still-alive Eno Cordova to rebuild the Jedi Archives with the help of a resistance organization called the Hidden Path. Cere and Cordova use the Archives to research Koboh and Tanalorr. \n\nCordova explains that Dagan was the first and only pilot who managed to find a path through the Koboh Abyss. Khri developed special compasses to navigate it, and the Republic then established a settlement and Jedi Temple on Tanalorr. However, a pirate syndicate known as the Nihil assaulted Tanalorr, causing the Republic to withdraw from the planet and destroy the compasses to keep them from using it. Dagan became obsessed with Tanalorr, believing it was his by right. Khri trapped him in the bacta tank where Cal found him. However, Cordova notes that three compasses are still unaccounted for. Cal, Merrin, Bode, and Greez decide to search for them; Bode wishes to find a refuge for his young daughter Kata, while Merrin believes that the Hidden Path could use Tanalorr as their new home. During their journey, Cal and Merrin confess their feelings for each other and decide to pursue a relationship.\n\nTwo compasses are unsalvageable, but after Cal defeats and kills Rayvis and Dagan, they discover one that Cordova is able to repair. Shortly after, the Empire launches an attack on Jedha. As chaos erupts, Bode steals the compass and murders Cordova. Cal tries to stop Bode from escaping, but Bode defeats him, revealing himself to be not only an imperial spy but a former Jedi who has since fallen to the dark side. Meanwhile, Cere prevents the Empire's forces from reaching the archive, but is killed while holding off Darth Vader to buy time for the Hidden Path to escape. Furious at Bode's betrayal, Cal uses a locator beacon to track his location in the Nova Garon system to an Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) base commanded by Lank Denvik. \n\nAfter infiltrating the Bureau, Cal eventually confronts Bode, who reveals that he worked in intelligence for the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars but disappeared when the Jedi Purge began. After Inquisitors killed his wife, Bode made a deal with Denvik to work for the ISB as a spy in exchange for keeping him and his daughter hidden from Vader. Revealing that he lured Cal to Nova Garon to create a distraction, hoping to be free of the ISB on his rendezvous to Tanalorr, Bode escapes with Kata and the compass. Cal chooses to embrace his own inner darkness while slaughtering Imperial troops in order to escape the garrison, though he stops himself from succumbing fully by sparing Denvik after Merrin talks him down. \n\nCal recovers a recording left behind by Khri, explaining that the arrays on Koboh can be used to open an alternate path through the Koboh Abyss. After narrowly navigating the abyss, the group arrives at Tanalorr in one piece. There, Cal, Merrin, and Kata attempt to convince Bode to back down, but he refuses and attacks them until Cal is forced to fatally shoot him. \n\nAfterward, they hold a Jedi funeral for Cere, Cordova, and Bode to mourn their passing. With the planet now under their control, Cal, Merrin, and Greez decide to adopt Kata and plan to make contact with the Hidden Path to relocate them to Tanalorr.\n\nDevelopment \nThe development of a sequel to Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was announced in January 2022. The game's title of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was announced in May 2022 alongside the debut of a CGI teaser trailer at Star Wars Celebration. The game was developed by Respawn Entertainment and was released on April 28, 2023 for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.\n\nGame director Stig Asmussen claimed real-time ray tracing and other next-gen capabilities enable Respawn to operate \"at a quality that's much above anything that we've ever developed before.\" By exclusively targeting ninth-generation consoles, Survivor enjoys significantly faster load times with a development team that is no longer obligated to support the older PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles the first game launched on. This is due to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles featuring a solid-state drive (SSD) that enables much faster asset loading times compared to a hard drive. Despite these statements, versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were announced in August 2023.\n\nMarketing and release \nThe first cinematic teaser for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was released in May 2022. EA showed expanded gameplay for the game at The Game Awards on December 8, while also announcing that it would be released on March 17, 2023. On January 31, 2023, EA announced via Twitter that the game's release would be delayed to April 28, 2023, for the Respawn development team to carry out final \"bug fixes to enhance performance, stability, polish, and most importantly, the player experience\". A nine minute gameplay video was released by IGN on February 7. At Star Wars Celebration on April 9, 2023, a \"final\" gameplay trailer was released for the game which included a look at the planet of Coruscant that Cal will journey to during the game's events.\n\nThere are three cosmetic sets available with a pre-order of the game. The first, available with a pre-order of both the standard and deluxe editions, is a \"Hermit\" cosmetic set replicating Obi-Wan Kenobi's outfit from the Obi-Wan Kenobi series and Kenobi's lightsaber from Episodes I and II. The two exclusive \"Scoundrel\" and \"Rebel Hero\" cosmetic sets available with the deluxe edition replicate Han Solo's DL-44 blaster and scoundrel outfit and Luke Skywalker's yellow jacket outfit from A New Hope.\n\nA free PC copy of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was included with a purchase of an AMD Ryzen 7000 processor in a promotional bundle deal that ran from January 2023 until April 1, 2023.\n\nTie-in media \nStar Wars Jedi: Battle Scars is a tie-in novel written by Sam Maggs, released on March 7, 2023, which bridges the five year story gap between Fallen Order and Survivor. The book's cover was revealed on December 1, 2022, featuring returning characters from Fallen Order including Cere Junda, Greez Dritus, Nightsister Merrin and BD-1. The Inquisitor Fifth Brother, who appeared in the TV series Star Wars Rebels and Obi-Wan Kenobi, was confirmed to appear. A preview excerpt from the book was released on January 31, 2023 where Cal must infiltrate the secret headquarters of the Haxion Brood crime syndicate that featured in Fallen Order.\n\nFollowing the game's initial release, Jedi Knight Cal Kestis, as he appeared in Survivor, was also introduced as a special playable character in the mobile turn-based role-playing game Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes on iOS and Android, unlocked by completing a series of stages that recapped the events of Fallen Order with several characters from that game the player was required to collect and upgrade.\n\nSurvivor is the final Star Wars game published during Electronic Arts' exclusivity contract with Lucasfilm, which is set to expire later in the year.\n\nReception \n\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. \n\nThe Guardian called Survivor \"the best Star Wars game in 20 years\" that is \"visually spectacular, mechanically sophisticated and riotously entertaining\". While disliking the \"bland\" story, The Verge enjoyed Survivor mix of action-platforming, writing, and how \"it manages to balance all of these different elements so that it never feels like you're stuck doing just one thing\". Polygon praised the visuals, but felt the game's combat broke down when fighting multiple enemies, \"the battles in which you're pitted against a horde of enemies — with a melee swarm steadily hammering your block meter, and laser fire breaking your combos from afar... those fights are intolerable\".\n\nMany reviewers noted performance problems with the PC version. PC Gamer review highlighted an average of 35 frames per second with dips as low as 15-20 frames in cutscenes. EA released a day one patch to improve the game's performance on PC and promised to release more patches in the following weeks. EA stated that a significant reason for poor performance is players using Windows 10 with advanced processors built for Windows 11.\n\nSales \nIn Japan, the PlayStation 5 version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor sold 16,742 physical units, making it the seventh best-selling retail game during its first week of release. In the United Kingdom, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launch sales were thirty percent higher than that of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In April and May 2023, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was the most downloaded game on the US and European PlayStation Store.\n\nAwards\n\nFuture \nIn a 2023 interview with IGN, Asmussen stated that he planned the Star Wars: Jedi series to be a trilogy, with the possible third and final major installment targeting the new Unreal Engine 5. In September 2023, Monaghan confirmed that a third game was in development.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2023 video games\nAction-adventure games\nElectronic Arts games\nPlayStation 5 games\nPlayStation 4 games\nRespawn Entertainment games\nSingle-player video games\nSpace opera video games\nStar Wars video games\nStar Wars Jedi (series)\nVideo games developed in the United States\nWindows games\nXbox Series X and Series S games\nXbox One games", "unikey": "Star Wars Jedi: Survivor", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Gameplay", "Synopsis", "Development", "Marketing_and_release", "Reception", "Future", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Star Wars Jedi: Survivorretains many of the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor and introduces new elements.

new characters of star wars jedi survivor they fit right in ad ad  content continues below cameron monaghan once again provides cals voice and motion capture most audiences probably recognize monaghan for his awardwinning job as the valeska aka the joker twins in gotham monaghan also played chad in malcolm in the middle and ahser in the giver to date cal kestes is monaghans only video game voice role cere junda  voiced by debra wilson like cal kestis cere junda is an exjedi who barely escaped order 66 unlike cal cere was a jedi knight with a padawan after escaping the empire cere cut herself off from the force but her padawan became one of the inquisitors that players face in star wars jedi fallen order during the course of the game cere trains cal helps him reconnect with the force and leads their attempt to restart the jedi order currently we cant say what role cere plays in star wars jedi survivor but it looks like she has parted ways with cal and is maintaining a jedi holocron library debra wilson returns to play cere junda but unlike cameron monaghan wilson is a voice actor veteran she played killsinshadow in tyranny savathun in destiny 2 and grace walker in wolfenstein ii the new colossus moreover wilson voiced amanda waller in batman the enemy within and will play that character again in the upcoming suicide squad kill the justice league greez dritus  voiced by daniel roebuck unlike the rest of the star wars jedi main cast greez dritus isnt human and couldnt be mistaken for one he is a latero a diminutive species with four arms while cere junda is technically in charge of the operation greez owns the ship they use as a home base the stinger mantis despite being riskaverse greez has a gambling problem that has gotten him in trouble with interstellar gangs ironically despite disliking nature greez has a green thumb and maintains a terrarium on his ship greez will probably continue to serve as the resident pilot in star wars jedi survivor greez is once again played by daniel roebuck who has been all over the acting landscape roebuck has played agent weine in final destination and biggs in the fugitive aside from greez roebuck only has one other video game voice acting credit to his name gary finkel in dead rising 3 dagan gera  voiced by cody fern dagan gera is a high republic jedi who has been preserved in a bacta tank for many years and has been harboring a grudge against the jedi council during that hibernation now free he seeks to complete his mission and set many fates in motion in the process ad ad  content continues below cody fern provides the voice for dagan gera fern has previously been an american horror story regular and also played duncan shepard on house of cards though young fern has already shown an ability to bring quite a lot of gravitas to his roles subscribe ad ad  content continues below in star wars jedi survivor noshir dalal voices bode akuna dalal is a prominent voice actor who has dipped his fingers into many popular properties gamers might recognize him as charles smith in red dead redemption 2 and kotallo in horizon forbidden west while star wars fans probably know dalal as vice admiral rampart in star wars the bad batch turgle  voiced by richard steven horvitz turgle iswell hes turgle hes an alien creature with a habit of getting into trouble by running one kind of scam or another his loyalty is without question though his usefulness is another matter entirely turgle is voiced by the legendary richard steven horvitz his first constant role was mighty morphin power rangers alpha 5 but these days horvitz is mostly known for billy from the grim adventures of billy and mandy the titular zim from invader zim and razputin aquato from the psychonauts series lately you can hear horvitz as moxxie in the web series helluva boss santari khri  voiced by tracy ifeachor santari khri is actually a jedi from the time of the high republic we only ever see her through flashbacks but her presence is felt through her history with dagan gera and some of the messages she left behind santari khris voice tracy ifeachor is mostly known for her liveaction roles she played cleo roberts in showtrial and tara coleman in treadstone but scifi aficionados probably recognize her as abigail naismith in doctor who santari khri is ifeachors second video game voice role coincidentally or perhaps not her first voice acting gig was playing elarea aldraste lord adacin and major korven in star wars knights of the old republic zee  voiced by kendal rae another relic of the high republic zee is a robot who got trapped during a mission and has survived many years in isolation still eager to help zee proves to be a valuable companion ad ad  content continues below zees voice actor kendal rae is famous among australian audiences although she has made a name for herself overseas audiences might know her as hannah waters in deadland and maggie bryan in neighbors rae also voiced tanta cinta in forspoken darth vader  voiced by scott lawrence you probably dont need to be told who darth vader is though its certainly a bit surprising to see him in survivor granted vader previously appeared in fallen order though his survivor cameo really helps sell why hes still one of the most feared forces in the galaxy scott lawrence returns to voice darth vader after previously playing him in fallen order lawrence has actually voiced vader in a few different star wars works recently though you may know him from his appearances in films like avatar and star trek into darkness or even from shows like fear the walking dead and sons of anarchy boba fett  voiced by temuera morrison boba fetts appearance has to be considered one of survivors most shocking moments without giving the full game away lets just say that fetts appearance serves as a pretty big payoff for a long and difficult series of side missions ad even better fett is voiced by none other than temuera morrison yes the man who has voiced boba fett in various star wars works for years now once again steps into the role to do what he does best shareshare on facebook opens in a new tabshare on twitter opens in a new tabshare on

face for the series as for those weapons cal will have access to lightsabers and a blaster on jedi survivors release the aforementioned dual blade option will see kestis flipping and spinning his two separate blades at high speed meanwhile he will be able to use his blaster simultaneously with a lightsaber it really speaks to where we find cal in this part of the story asmussen explained calling kestis an unconventional jedi its five years since the first game and the dark times are still in full swing he has to do unconventional things so something that would be frowned upon during the height of the jedi order cals finding hes going to do whatever it takes cal can also wield a crossguardstyle lightsaber in the style of kylo ren on jedi survivors release this option provides players with a more confident approach as it is weighty blade asmussen also revealed cal will be joined by a new face on his journey through a galaxy far far away  a mercenary by the name of bode akuna you can see bode briefly in the trailer above  and cal form a special bond throughout jedi survivor asmussen stated its almost like theyre brothers theyre not exactly the same but they really do complement each other lastly asmussen touched on the new traversal techniques cal can use to make his way around the games worlds these include an ascension cable for climbing and crossing while cal

played its now the definitive singleplayer star wars experience dark forces in many ways survivor feels like last years god of war ragnarok its a sequel that both in terms of gameplay and narrative can feel more like part two of a grander story the narrative is set five years after the events of fallen order and in that time the mantis crew from the original game has drifted apart now sporting a beard and more battle scars cal has been fighting endless battles with the empire for saw gerrera after a heist on coruscant goes wrong he ends up on the planet of koboh where mantis pilot greez now runs a cantina after a few chance encounters and some begging from greez to settle down cal discovers dagan gera a jedi who has been preserved in a bacta tank since the high republic era its a

doesnt have the failings of each individual genre those being either too linear too convoluted too much backtracking almost sounds like a perfect formula that is if you like star wars 0 21brydontkwed 26th apr 2023 nessisonett right camerons a good looking guy and i found his char in the first one to be extremely rogueish and likeable 3 22matroskawed 26th apr 2023 yohn777 ive always found that saying silly because youre meant to judge a literal book by its cover  thats the point of it lotr will have certain covers that say clockwork orange wouldnt have anyway the fact im asking what the character is actually like means im looking for input not just assuming the character is as annoying as he looks anyway the look of a character is important  how would you feel if dante looked like james corden or if nathan drake looked like snape it wouldnt really work would it 6 23systemaddictwed 26th apr 2023 yehay ill get this better get crackin on that dl  0 24livewireclswed 26th apr 2023

the tech issues present yes before the patch the 30fps quality mode was actually smoother than the performance mode it was a bit madi havent tested the 30fps mode since the patch but while there are still small dips in the 60fps performance mode its so much better now a more than acceptable way to play the game 2 29kundalinirising333wed 26th apr 2023 liamcroft awesome thanks 0 30judal27wed 26th apr 2023 matroska hes been the most likable protagonist in a western game ive played in a long while he looked fine in fallen order but in survivor he kinda looks dumb 0 31titntinwed 26th apr 2023 loved the first one and im glad this one does not disappointthanks for a good overview liam im glad you enjoyed it 0 32yohn777wed 26th apr 2023 matroska physical character details dont really impact the personality of characters period they can but its not really even close to the most important thing when you actually learn the details of somebody clearly with what people whove played dmc know about the game if dante looked like james corden obviously that would clash with lots of the games elements just radically judging people how they look without really knowing anything else is just kinda crappy thats my story  im stickin to it if you think somebody is an ahole just because theyre old or have a beard or a tattoo or something youre just stereotyping them 10 33r1spamwed 26th apr

much as i have  1 47drventure69wed 26th apr 2023 looks like performance mode is 1440p x 60fps which is fine matches with the ps5 version of fallen order ive just gone from playing death stranding to fallen order and its a bit blurry when you first start playing but fine after a couple of minutes i guess survivor is going to be a similar experience got a 2tb wd850n coming tomorrow so by the time its finished downloading i should have finished fallen order again  1 48tchungawed 26th apr 2023 matroska i actually kind of wish that cal was a bit of a twt honestly that way hed actually have some character obviously id prefer him to be likeable over being annoying but the way he is now or how he was in fallen order is completely devoid of any personality hes yet another boring modern video game protagonist in the likes of aloy or jin sakai just nothing to him really just a wet blanket of a character that wont offend anyone but no one will love either 1 49relygonwed 26th apr 2023 sweet

states the performance mode is pretty much a locked 60fps at 1440p post day1 patch 0 63keldorthecursedthu 27th apr 2023 i enjoyed the first game for what it was i wasnt as blown away by it as many others seemed to be but thought the combat was pretty lackluster it sounds like they didnt do a whole lot to improve that aspect of it so im not really chomping at the bit to play this one that being said my backlog is so full i wont be playing it anytime soon anyway ill pick it up during a future sale for sure though 1 64keldorthecursedthu 27th apr 2023 liamcroft does using the lightsaber still feel like hitting enemies with a whiffle bat the trailers made it look like there were more dismemberments etc i get that a realistic lightsaber would be almost gamebreaking but ive always hated how nerfed they feel in video games there has to be a happy medium somewhere 1 65mug3nhcthu 27th apr 2023 liamcroft several other reviews mentioned that the framerate issues are quite significant why would that be 1 66rubycarbunclethu 27th apr 2023 its supposed to be abysmal on pc which is the version i bought so ill be getting a refund for it and buying the ps5 version instead its really disappointing to think my 30 and 4090 wont be able to run this very well but at least theres an alternative way of playing it but still im just getting really fed up of pc games releasing in such a horrendous state the saying pc master race does not apply anymore 0 67kundalinirising333thu 27th apr 2023 1 68tr3mm0rthu 27th apr 2023 rubycarbuncle that is why last year i finally decided to not upgrade my gaming pc anymore and moved to ps5 nowadays i use my pc for browsing and media games only on console i am pretty happy with that especially that ps5 has great gamepad and i can save a lot of money with not buying expensive pc parts also in time i got rid off the habit of geting to settings and checking fps in every game freshly installed lol this year ill be getting an imac and try to sell my pc if not then ill just let the pc to die natural death 1 69tselliotthu 27th apr 2023 matroska nothing jocklike to cameron monaghan if anything he seems the opposite whatever that means 0 70tselliotthu 27th apr 2023 rubycarbuncle yeah i have a pc with a 3060ti and a ps5 but from what ive gathered its not playing well on even newer video cards so its apparently extremely optimized for consoles and not even worth trying on my pc so i went the ps5 route 1 71dekker451thu 27th apr 2023 any real control over the lightsabre or is it just more buttonmashing 0 72nintendo4sonicfri 28th apr 2023 didnt expect it to be that good from what i played so far its a masterpieceand my god this is a new benchmark title it looks so damn stunning every second thanks to vrr it runs fluid even in resolution mode 0 73cassielfri 28th apr 2023 much better than the first one the fallen order was a crap port it was better in xbox but survivor is great im playing at resolution mode and ive got 60 fps and perhaps more not tearing no shuttering no issues as for the haptics and rumbling  its brilliant much better in all aspects than fallen order mind you i recommend that you own a vrr all hdmi 21 capable telly since it uses vrr and else im playing with my dualsense edge just epic 0 74styledvinny79fri 28th apr 2023 visually the game is not good blurred faces and choppiness i am not impressed at all and no way id play the 60fps as the graphics drop more 1 75mikeoratorfri 28th apr 2023 1 76tchungafri 28th apr 2023 grapetrap i wouldnt necessarily go that far i think a piece of wood has far more personality than either jin or aloylol jokes aside im glad at least someone was able to get something from them i certainly wasnt its hard for me to when i remember what an actual good protagonist can be like cal jin and aloy have absolutely nothing on protags like leon kennedy commander shepard or even nathan drake at the end of the day were all entitled to our own opinions but in my mind there is absolutely no comparison 0 77mikeoratorfri 28th apr 2023 tchungai havent played re4 so cant speak to leonsure yes commander shepard is a very good protagonist only because they are fairly black slate of course they have motivations for narrative reasons but you can for the most part play them however you wishas for nathan drake he may have a great personality and is as charming as any roguish ner do well but it all flies in the face of the ludonarrative dissonance of him literally killing so many people albeit baddies that he would and should be an emotional wreckcompare this to jin who does have conflicting thoughts about what he is doing and the killing he is taking part in he feels guilt over the nontraditional ways he needs to fight in order to beat this new enemy there are also the regrets from his past when he was a youth that tear at him in very real and lifealtering ways we go through an emotional journey with jin that most of us who have had to make profound compromises or have made bad choices can relate toaloy has been shunned for her entire and now she rejects anyone getting close to her or letting them help her she uses this defense mechanism for the loss of her youth and the fear they will die and leave her as rost did then she is then thrown into a journey that she didnt ask for but like the woman from the past she is connected to across 1000 years she finds a way to overcome her fear and regret to do things she would not have thought possibleboth of these characters have emotional stories that take them to places both physically and emotionally where they can work on these parts of themselves eventually making them better peopleanyway yes you are entitled to believe what you like but please dont dismiss these characters as not being good just because you cannot relate to the emotional growth they both experienced 0 78tchungafri 28th apr 2023 grapetrap im not trying to be dismissive the reason i dont connect with jin or aloy is not from a lack of trying i never go into games or any other media for that matter not wanting to like the protagonist as i played both ghost of tsushima and horzion zero dawn to completion as well as the sequel forbidden west but during that entire run time nothing stood out to me as likeable or memorable about either of those characters and like i said its certainly not from a lack trying sure they both have various traumas that theyve gone through like you said but trauma and character traits arent necessarily one in the same for example bad things happen to lead characters all the time just look at nathan drake by the end of uncharted 4 the man has absolutely gone through the wringer between his relationship with elena and him finding out about his long lost brother its a lot for one man to go through but just because hes been through some sht is not the reason i like him i like him because hes a suave charismatic swashbuckling adventurer to put it more simply i like his personality not his trauma what youve described about jin and aloy are all things that theyve been through not defining traits or characteristics being an outcast isnt a personality its a trauma and trauma isnt enough for me to grapple onto a character i need something a bit more i think what jin is going through is a bit closer to what im referring to being torn between two conflicting life choices is definitely compelling stuff but even after rolling credits i still feel like what happens to jin is far more interesting than anything hes said or done himself thats cool if its good enough for you but its not enough for me and as far as the ludonarrative dissonance is concerned youd be wrong in thinking it doesnt also apply to jin or aloy jin and aloy kill hundreds if not thousands of people by the end of their respective games i know uncharted is the popular series to slap the ol ludo narrative title onto but this criticism applies to most video games its not exclusively an uncharted thing 1 79asmilingmanfri 28th apr 2023 liamcroft great review in fact looks so good that im wondering whether i would enjoy this even though im not into the sw movies and series do you have thoughts on whether this could be enjoyable as a standalone 0 80liamcroftsat 29th apr 2023 asmilingman i would recommend trying jedi fallen order first since thats the first game in this story and is standalone from the star wars movies even though its an excellent game i dont think i could recommend survivor at full price for someone with no exposure to the series if you enjoy fallen order though this is even better 0 81bookhouseboysat 29th apr 2023 i find it mental that this game is getting positive reviews with the glaring obvious technical issues its having in its current state even if the gameplay and story were amazing which theyre not so far this game should be sitting at around a 6 1 82kundalinirising333sat 29th apr 2023 1 83kundalinirising333sun 30th apr 2023 0 84barrymoresun 30th apr 2023 i keep hearing discourse about the pc version being a mess the ps5 version is also a mess same issues and i can confirm thisno excuse for this and frankly push square your review made light of the technical issues and was too generous in its score reviews are there to guard against this otherwise whats the pointin my opinion review sites and publishers are at fault here and they should both look at their processesim not someone who generally cares but these issues are so bad i can get behind the review bombing 2 85sgttruthsun 30th apr 2023 barrymore i agree ive been watching the various tech analysis videos on youtube and the frame rate issues are anything but minorits catastrophically broken the performance mode falls well below the viable vrr range on an xsx let alone the more limited window on a ps5  and vrr doesnt even work as the screen tearsthe image is quite literally broken and split apart can you imagine how movie reviewers would react if the image was literally shearing apartwhen publishing a review before a game is launched the review is advising consumers whether to buy the game on launch and at the full priceits not a speculative review rating a version of the game that may or may not exist in a month two months or even 6 months time if indeed ever gets fixed 1 86kundalinirising333sun 30th apr 2023 sgttruth well put 100 agree 0 87mus422mon 1st may 2023 having played all weekend i think the minor framerate issues quote is misleading tbhthe framerate dips are pretty horrendous in my opinion very disappointing to see this kind of performance for a game of this sizei really hope patches can fix it but i have a feeling its not going to get sorted properly soon 0 88drawfullmon 1st may 2023 as others have mentioned the frame dips are anything but minor down to 15fps in resolution mode sub 30 in performance mode  and id take issue with the inconsistent visuals too theyre consistently a blurred horrible mess even the screen shots on this page are really poorps isnt the only site to sing this games praises but reviews need to hold unfinished games to account else whats the point they are becoming as untrustworthy as the developers 1 89mikeoratortue 2nd may 2023 tchungai appreciate your perspective and the civility of the conversation i now understand your perspective and can appreciate the nuance that you have assigned to the characters that you love my only issue at first was how dismissive you were of any value either jin or aloy had at all i can now see that it was hyperbole in order to make your point about modern video game protagonists stronger 0 90alterjokertue 2nd may 2023 get2sammyb they do a recap of the story when you load up this game for the first time 0 91tchungatue 2nd may 2023 grapetrap i appreciate your appreciation but technically its not really hyperbole if i meant what i said and in this case i absolutely did mean what i said unless of course youre implying that im being disingenuous which i certainly dont think you are making such accusations is clearly beneath either one of us 0 92mikeoratortue 2nd may 2023 tchungai only meant it seemed like you outright hated jin and aloy in your original post only to explain that you did see the redeeming qualities in the way they were written in another post certainly we have all used different tones in our comment writing to express ideas

story image eawere living in an age of star wars excess  theres just so much of it when one show ends another is set to begin with a little detour into animation in between and there are plenty of movies on the horizonbut when it comes to video games the galaxy far far away hasnt been quite so prolific thats what made jedi fallen order stand out so much it didnt have the most exciting story and its various gameplay elements were all culled from other existing blockbusters but it was a wellmade adventure that let players live out the fantasy of wielding a lightsaber or forcepushing a stormtrooper off a cliff and that was enough the sequel jedi survivor doesnt mess with that simple premise it simply gives you more  and the kyber crystal shine hasnt worn off quite yetlike the original survivor stars cal kestis a former jedi padawan who survived the purge of his order and is now acting as a kind of forcewielding gunforhire  thorn in the empires side the sequel picks up five years later with cal and his band of friends  including former jedi knight cere fourarmed pilot greez and nightsister merrin  having all gone their separate ways a lot happens but the core of the story revolves around a mythical planet that a could be home to some important treasure and b would serve as an excellent hiding place for all of the forcesensitive beings who the empire is hunting downrelatedjedi fallen order shows that a good star wars game doesnt have to be originalsurvivor becomes a planethopping adventure as cal and his adorable droid pal bd1 attempt to locate all kinds of scifi macguffins in order to get to the planet youll explore imperial bases on destroyed moons ancient jedi ruins and a wild weststyle planet with lots of space to roam once again cal is far and away the least interesting character he has a bit of a darker edge here which you can tell because of his new beard and a lategame plot twist that is in no way surprising but hes more of a blank vessel for the player which is largely fine because the rest of the cast is much more entertaining that includes returning folks like merrin and her mysterious magical ways as well as new faces like a laidback bounty hunter with an australian accent and a droid who has been alone for a few hundred years best of all are some great villains including a waifish former jedi with one arm and a vibe that will inspire plenty of fanfiction image eathe main storyline has its moments but its mainly an excuse to jump from planet to planet in search of adventure while getting to hang out with  and face off against  cool people from the star wars universe half the time i forgot what piece of longabandoned jedi lore or ancient compasslike object i was searching for i just enjoyed the search i much preferred digging into all of the optional lore as your helpful droid will greedily scan every enemy creature and piece of architecture for future referenceand just like before survivor pretty shamelessly mashes together elements of other games the exploration is a mix of tomb raider and metroid as you explore areas full of interconnected rooms many of which you cant reach until you unlock the right ability like a double jump or extended grappling hook you can wall jump like in super mario parkour across buildings like spiderman and perform killer finishing moves like in god of war there are breath of the wildstyle physics puzzles and set pieces where youre running through destruction like nathan drake in unchartedwhat makes the game work is how it manages to not only connect these various styles of game seamlessly but also make them feel intrinsically like part of the star wars universe of course cal can move like peter parker and fight like kratos hes a jedi and theres something immensely satisfying about being able to pull off these skills from the movies in a game i enjoyed using the force to shove chatty battle droids off a cliff every single time i did it which was a lot the series is developed by respawn a studio known for action games like titanfall and apex legends and its expertise at making combat and movement just feel good is on full display once again thats true whether youre blocking blaster bolts with ease or running along the side of a derelict spacecraftperhaps the most impressive thing about survivor is how it manages to balance all of these different elements so that it never feels like youre stuck doing just one thing among the main story missions are ones where youll be spelunking through ancient caves with lots of simple environmental puzzles to solve as well as more combatfocused missions where you take out dozens of imperials or a new group of surprisingly tough raidersthere are a few frustrating moments the platforming sequences can be thrilling but they can require trial and error its often impossible to see whats up ahead so the only way to figure out your next move is to die and try again things also get very dark in terms of visuals not tone  to the point that i regularly missed teenytiny details that i needed to spot in order to proceed theres a hint system when youre stuck but its not very helpful image eathis was all true of fallen order and survivor mostly follows suit but aside from the largely forgettable story it does add some notable things expanding on the elements that made the original work chief among these is the lightsaber combat there are a handful of new styles of lightsaber techniques you can master and you have the ability to equip two at a time letting you easily swap between them in the midst of a battle i eventually settled on two preferred modes of wielding the blade one where i had a standard lightsaber in each hand was great for dealing with enemies quickly but i also mastered a kylo renstyle cross guard lightsaber for the times i needed to deal a heavy blowyou also have a much greater and more fluid set of movement abilities by the end youll be able to combine them for some riveting platforming sequences where youll run along walls dash through the air and swing from a grappling hook without ever taking a moment to touch the ground im usually terrible at these games but survivor made me feel like well a graceful jedi also now you can ride mounts that look like chocobossurvivor expands on what you can do outside of those main missions too that includes the requisite side quests which are generally a big improvement when it comes to storytelling like a string where you have to defeat a series of bounty hunters before they can hunt your bounty but there are also a handful of smaller more frivolous diversions theres the customization where you can really geek out about the color and materials of your lightsaber you can now really shake up how cal looks too with lots of different outfits hairstyles and beards that you can weirdly gather from treasure chests my cal looked like fezco from euphoria decked out as a star wars smugglertheres also a new element that is almost like a light basebuilding mode cals friend greez the pilot is now the proprietor of a saloon on a frontier planet where youll be spending a lot of time as you complete missions and explore you can recruit new characters to come hang out at the saloon giving you more options to talk to people and take on more missions but you can also do things like grow a rooftop garden from seeds you find on various planets and work with a talking sea snail to collect fish for the saloons aquarium from what i can tell these dont have much of a material benefit but theyre fun little distractions and they help you get to know characters who are a lot more interesting than the main campaign story you can also continue doing this stuff after the main story wraps upso no jedi survivor isnt any less derivative than its predecessor its story is bland and cal is still boring as hell but once again none of that really matters this is the closest most of us will ever get to feeling like a jedi and at that the game succeeds the sequel builds on the original in small ways without messing up the parts that made it workstar wars jedi survivor launches

older gruffer and showing the scars of war is at an impasse as is the fate of the galaxy itselfstar wars jedi survivor is a story about the decisions people make when faced with war itâs a story of facing seemingly insurmountable odds forging relationships in the few fleeting moments of peace and itâs about found family itâs also one of the very best star wars games yet madea sequel that feels more like itâs ten years removed from the original rather than only four survivor is expanded in virtually every sense packed with so much to do and see that even when our journey came to an end we

finds himself reunited with his old friend greez dritus the onetime mantis captain and now owner and proprietor of pyloonâs saloon a watering hole on the nowhere planet of koboh however as cal soon discovers koboh is home to far more including a highrepublicinfused mystery that could lead cal and his crew to a safe haven away from the empire complicating things is the discovery of dagan gera an ancient jedi that cal finds locked in a bacta tank after generationswhile there is plenty more we could say about gera and the revelations cal comes to understand about his role in the game weâve chosen to be as light on story detail as possible in this review why because this is a star wars story that deserves to be approached with as little information as possiblethere are multiple sequences including a few in succession during the gameâs closing act during which we audibly swore with excitement over it took us back to that feeling of wanting to turn to our friend in the cinema and punch their arm with astonishmentstar wars is at its best when it can trade that bombast and action with quiet moments between characters and survivor handles them beautifully this is star wars at its best it manages decades of lore gracefully gives all the characters new and returning time to shine and features dozens of moments that have inspired generations to pick up the nearest mop and make whoom noisescere junda and merrin return as does bode akuna a swashbuckling han solowithajetpack type who assists cal throughout the game both in the narrative and in gameplay like with dagan gera weâll leave the specifics of their place in the galaxy in survivor unsaid but rest assured that by the end of the game we were delighted with how their characters were handledthe star or should we say stars or the show however are cal and bd1 if this performance doesnât get cameron monaghan a disney show following the adventures of cal kestis between respawnâs two games then we donât know what willstar wars is at its best when it can trade that bombast and action with quiet moments between characters and survivor handles them beautifullyhis performance is charming mature and markedly different from that of fallen order you feel the passage of time and the development into a fullfledged jedi knight aided by the gameâs incredible cinematics monaghan conveys so much wordlessly that it makes for a standout performance weâre highly hopeful thereâs plenty more cal kestis in cameron monaghanâs futurelike fallen order survivor is a soulslite you gain experience by killing enemies which is spent at specific resting points throughout the world however doing so also respawns all the enemies youâve defeated you have limited health thatâs also only refreshed in this way and combat at its most basic is dodgeparryattackat least it was in fallen order like everything else in survivor the combat has been greatly expanded now offering five stances single dual wield doublebladed cross guard and blaster every encounter in the game can be approached in myriad different waysthe game opens these up quickly so youâre given ample time to experiment with the stances and find which ones work for you however thereâs a flaw in the stance system that we think limits the potential the system could have had unfortunately youâre limited to only using two stances at a time meaning you have to travel to a meditation point in order to change your âloadoutâhaving this be the case instead of offering all five at once to switch between feels like it somewhat limits the creativity that could have been offered by the system as such it is easy to fall into the trap of overreliance on one stance and overcommitment to that stanceâs skill treewhile the cross guard is a cool addition especially for the kylo ren obsessives among us we didnât use it a great deal instead opting to more heavily invest in the single and blaster stance not only in terms of skill points but learning the gameâs difficult parry timings on greater difficultiesthe game opens these up quickly so youâre given ample time to experiment with the stances and find which ones work for you however thereâs a flaw in the stance system that we think limits the potential the system could have hadspeaking of the blaster the uncivilized weapon is a great addition to the game in what i can only assume to be a specific joke about how soulsinspired the game seemingly is the blaster even comes with a bloodbornestyle parry should you time a shot just as your enemy is approachingwhile youâll spend much of your time on the huge open world of koboh there are a few more small planets to explore weâre in two minds about the way the game handles locations while itâs undoubtedly a better thing that the game has moved away from linear corridor levels with minimal exploring suvivorâs two largest planets koboh lushes forests and caves and jedha endless sand dunes and ruins do get somewhat repetitive when exploring furtherunfortunately we encountered some technical issues during our time with star wars jedi survivor it should be noted that we completed the game before we had access to the dayone patch which may or may not improve the issues we facedbuy star wars jedi survivorstar wars jedi survivor ps5â2999â699934976999â64996999star wars jedi survivor xbox series xsâ2999â699932196999â64996999in the games open area the frame rate even in the games performance mode was worryingly inconsistent screen tearing was a regular occurrence and level of detail popin was a regular issue the game also seemed to struggle to load in certain areas forcing us to wait at the door of the saloon while it struggled to populate the interior koboh and its large open play space seem to be the issue as in the more linear levels the game ran extremely wellthe quality mode is supposed to trade the 60fps experience for 30fps and improved visuals but considering that the game performs poorly in the open spaces even on performance wed recommend playing on quality mode to fully take advantage of the excellent visualsstar wars isnt one thing and it hasnt been for a long time you need only look at the breadth of films disney shows and the expanded universe to see that but what star wars jedi survivor gets so right is that no matter your preference in a galaxy far far away it delivers excellent characters led by a wonderful cameron monaghan performance an exciting story that shocked us with twists from hour one to hour thirtythe performance issues we encountered were disappointing but didnt dampen the excitement of exploring the galaxy with some of the best characters of the disney erastar wars jedi survivor is star wars at its very best a thrilling adventure with a stellar cast tied together with smart expansive combat and huge new worlds to explore performance issues aside its easily one of the best star wars games ever made and only makes us wants more tales from the adventures of cal kestis

visit it grounds the experience in a single frontier world called koboh with more than a little old west inspiration large swaths of the game unfold in the different corners of this semiopen world planet filled with rumors to track down bounties to hunt and secrets to uncover i like the locale but by the end i was growing tired of running in circles to the same destination after so many prior visits thankfully whether on koboh or visiting planets like coruscant or jedha a new fast travel system makes navigation between meditation points easy customization is foundational across the game and its reward systems from tweaking hairstyles jackets and saber colors to character perks and powers that extends to increased ownership over the world through the ability to enhance a cantina with a garden an aquarium new visitors and even musical tracks i felt invested in the adventure and the improvements i found along the way across its lengthy campaign jedi survivor takes an initially meandering course to find its plotline but eventually coalesces into a story about disparate people searching for a safe home the momenttomoment character interactions and dialogue help elevate the lack of focus with some sweeping melodrama in the best traditions of star wars fiction the distinctions between love and attachment and the dangers of both often lurk in the background of star wars stories those themes take centerstage this time with memorable and rewarding results developer respawn entertainment clearly took a measured and thoughtful approach to analyze what worked and what didnt in its last star wars game and jedi survivor feels like a worthy attempt at evolution it captures the magic of star wars as well as anything in the current canon and its a stellar adventure in
