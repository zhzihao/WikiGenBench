{"id": 71522047, "key": "Negros famine", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negros%20famine", "text": "The Negros famine took place on Negros island in the Philippines in the mid-1980s, during the waning days of the Marcos dictatorship, and was a key moment in the history of sugar production in the Philippines, as well as the broader political history of the Philippines. Caused by the Marcos administration's efforts to control sugar production through the NASUTRA monopoly held by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto and by a sudden crash in international sugar prices, it created what popularly came to be known as a \"social volcano\", with tensions culminating in the Escalante massacre, and with negative effects still felt even after the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos and his cronies during the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\nBackground\n\nSugar production in the Philippines \nThe cultivation of sugarcane, specifically Saccharum sinense, in the Philippines pre-dates Spanish colonization, being one of the original major crops of the Austronesian peoples, which includes Filipinos. It was traditionally used for making various native jaggery products (collectively called panutsa, like pakombuk, sangkaka and bagkat bao) used in cooking. It was also widely used to make traditional wines like palek, byais, basi, intus, and pangasi, and its juice was also used to create vinegar.\n\nSugarcane farming became an industry after 1856 when Russell & Sturgis first opened a branch in Iloilo for the purpose of giving crop loans to sugar planters. They offered liberal terms to a few Negrense planters, which encouraged some prominent Ilonggo sugarcane planters like the Ledesma, Lacson, Hilado, Cosculluela, Pérez, Alvarez, Sotamayor and Escanilla families moved to Negros in the mid-1800s. The sugar products were exported to the United States, England, Australia and Spain.\n\nThe industry continued to grow through the Philippines' colonial period and allowed a small group of Filipino families to accumulate wealth and status, and become part of the Philippines' social elite.\n\nThe Marcos dictatorship \n\nIn 1965, two decades after the end of the Second World War and the subsequent recognition of the Philippines' independence in 1946, Ferdinand Marcos became the Philippines tenth president.  Relying on foreign debt to fund an ambitious slate of programs and projects, Marcos became popular enough to become the first Philippine post-war president to win a second term as president.  This second term, however, was marked by social unrest when his debt-driven spending and budget made the Philippine economy vulnerable to dramatic downturns in the global economy.  Before the end of his second and last allowed term under the Constitution of the Philippines, Marcos held on to power by declaring martial law in 1972, and replacing the Constitution with a new one in 1973.  Although he formally lifted martial law almost a decade later in 1981, Marcos still hold on to his martial law powers, remaining a dictator until he was ousted by the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\nThe National Sugar Trading Corporation monopoly\nBy the time Ferdinand Marcos' second term began, sugar had become a critical Philippine export, responsible for 27% of the country's total dollar earnings. With international sugar prices rising rapidly through the early 1970s, Marcos decided to put domestic and international sugar trading under government control, first through the Philippine Exchange Co. (Philex), and later through the Philippine Sugar Commission (Philsucom) and its trading arm, the National Sugar Trading Corporation (NASUTRA) which were both controlled by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto.\n\nHowever, the international price of sugar eventually dropped in a market crash, dramatically hurting the livelihood of poor farmers.\n\nOnset of famine \nThe NASUTRA monopoly forced many sugar planters into bankruptcy or deep in debt. In 1984, over 190,000 sugar workers lost their livelihood, and about a million sacadas and their families in Negros suffered in what would later become known as the 1985 \"Negros Famine.\"\n\nOne of the factors that worsened the situation for the people of Negros was the overreliance on sugar as virtually the island's only agricultural crop (monoculture), with the Journal of the Senate of the Philippines noting that: \"practically the entire agricultural land of the province was devoted to sugarcane farms primarily in response to the lure of easy money and great profits from sugar which was then enjoying a privileged position in the world market.\"\n\nBy 1985, a survey by the National Nutrition Council of the Philippines estimated that about 350,000 children – 40 percent of Negros Occidental residents under the age of 14 – were suffering from malnutrition.\n\nAuthor John Silva, who was working with Oxfam at the time, visited Negros and later described the living conditions of thousands of starving and malnourished children:\"I drove past the provincial hospital where I first saw hundreds of malnourished children on mats on the floors tended by their mothers, and later, we were in the country through cane fields and small towns remembering the skeletal children being weighed and assessed by our medical team.... There were over 100,000 children in various degree of malnutrition and we started a feeding program for 90,000 of them, hoping to save the worst cases.\"\n\n1985 infant death statistics at Bacolod City Hospital rose 67 percent, and Negros' infant mortality rose to nearly double the national average, with most of the deaths attributed to malnutrition.\n\nSocial impact\n\nEscalante massacre \n\nLocally, social tensions were so high that the Bishop of Bacolod, Antonio Fortich described the conditions on the island as a \"social volcano\" ready to explode. This was the situation on 20 September 1985, which marked the date of the Escalante massacre, in which paramilitary forces under the command of Marcos-allied Negros Occidental Governor Armando Gustilo gunned down farmers protesting social conditions on the 13th anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law. An estimated twenty or thirty farmers were killed, and thirty more were wounded.\n\nPress coverage \nThe Negros famine received a lot of media and institutional attention around the world. Among the most iconic images of the famine was Kim Komenich's photograph of a boy named Joel Abong, which was part of the coverage by journalist Inday Espina-Varona, who wrote about the last days of Abong's life, before he succumbed to pneumonia, tuberculosis, and malnutrition.\n\nMultisectoral response\n\nInternational, church, and non-governmental support \nAlerted about the crisis by shocking media coverage, a multisectoral effort to mitigate the worst effects of the famine was launched. International relief agencies, local non-governmental organizations, and the Catholic Church conducted feeding programs, mobilized relief drives, and otherwise pitched in to help.\n\nPeople Power Revolution and reform through land distribution \nThe immediate impacts of the Negros famine were still being felt when Marcos was ousted by the People Power Revolution in 1986. Efforts to address hunger and malnutrition continued through the collaboration of the new Philippine government, the Catholic Church, and the international community.  \n\nIn the long term, however, the administration of President Corazon Aquino sought to redistribute land through the new Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law. It also put policies in place to diversify agricultural production on the island by polyculture. Under a \"60-30-10 plan,\" 60% of Negros' agricultural lands would continue to be allocated to sugar, while 30% was allocated to other high-value export crops. The remaining 10% was earmarked for home gardens and contract growing.\n\nReferences \n\nAgriculture in the Philippines\nFamines in Asia\nHistory of Negros Occidental\nMan-made disasters in the Philippines", "unikey": "Negros famine", "summary": "\nThe Negros famine took place on Negros island in the Philippines in the mid-1980s, during the waning days of the Marcos dictatorship.[1][2] It was a key moment in the history of sugar production in the Philippines, as well as the broader political history of the Philippines.

2018  uncategorized indigenous rice wine making in central panay philippines indigenous rice wine making in central panay philippines emma t gico and evelyn r ybarzabal abstract this study was conducted to document the process of making rice wine called pangasi by the panay bukidnon indigenous people ip in tapaz capiz specifically it aimed to describe the ingredients and procedure used and to compare them with other rice wines made in the philippines likewise it also aimed to describe and discuss the emerging themes deduced from documenting the making of pangasi rice wine by the panay bukidnon ip information were collected through direct observation and semistructured interview gathered from key cultural informants who were also the participants in the focus group discussion they are members of the council of elders of the tapaz indigenous peoples organization tipo the information gathered were crosschecked with existing literature of documented traditional wine making from different areas in the philippinesthe indigenous rice wine pangasi used by the central panay bukidnon indigenous people in tapaz capiz is different from the pangasi made by the subanons in zamboanga del norte the main ingredient used in making pangasi of the central panay bukidnon ip is ordinary nonwaxy upland rice while the pangasi of the subanen indigenous people of zamboanga del norte makes use of cassava tubers as the main ingredient and a starter consisting of a concoction from 24 to 60 species of plant herbs as reported by nabua 2013 however it is similar to pangasi or gasi which is a traditional drink among the subanuns of mindanao made also from rice with added crushed ginger root and red hot pepper but water is added to it it is almost the same as pangasi made from rice in north western mindanao specifically in bukidnon in a study cited by sanchez 2008 from sakai and caldo 1985b however they reportedly used sugar solution which is added for the second stage of fermentation instead of sugar cane juice which is used by the central panay bukidnon ip in tapaz capiz the use of leaves in the processing of pangasi which included adgaw talus and young coconut leaves have not been mentioned in earlier related studies however regarding their local knowledge on cleanliness and sanitation it is believed that these leaves are naturally clean especially if they are ugbus or young and have not been too exposed yet in the environment indigenous women have an important role to play in using and preserving this valuable local knowledge they just have to be better recognized and supported by the community the value of pangasi is much more than just a traditional drink one can hold in his hand rather it is one that holds the indigenous community altogether aptly described by fox 1984 as having this social and ritual value the use of rice wine may be seen as a powerful integrating force which links and binds the individual to the group fox 1984 the local knowledge of the panay bukidnon ip in making pangasi is comparable to the other local knowledge of other indigenous cultures in the philippines they just need to have it standardized so that their practice will no longer be always as per estimate basis but would be quantifiable or in terms of measured quantities so as to yield a consistent quality product site map site map central philippine university  2019
