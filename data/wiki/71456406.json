{"id": 71456406, "key": "Battle of Soledar", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Soledar", "text": "The battle of Soledar was a series of military engagements in and around the urban-type settlement of Soledar during the battle of Donbas in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussian forces began an offensive on 3 August 2022, shelling Soledar, Bakhmut, and surrounding villages to the south and east. Repeated local Russian assaults on or near Soledar continued into October, with many repelled by the Ukrainian army. By late December, much of the fighting in the region centered around Bakhmut, with Soledar seen as a satellite stronghold protecting the city's northeastern flank and supply lines. By this time, much of Soledar had been reduced to ruins.\n\nDirect Russian assaults on Soledar resumed in late December-early January 2023, and on 16 January Russian forces captured the last sector of its industrial zone and secured control of the town, allowing the Russians to further threaten Bakhmut's northern and northeastern outskirts.\n\nBackground\n\nDuring the eastern Ukraine campaign in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian and separatist forces set their sights on seizing the Donbas region, consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Parts of these oblasts, including their capitals with the same names, were seized in pro-Russian uprisings in 2014. In late June and early July 2022, Luhansk oblast fell under Russian control following the Ukrainian withdrawal from Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. The battlefield then shifted towards the cities of Bakhmut, Siversk, and Soledar, all key settlements in Donetsk Oblast.\n\nThe first shelling in Soledar began on 17 May, when Russian forces used drones and planes against Soledar, Klinove, and Vovchoiarivka. The next day, Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said Russian forces had closed within 20 kilometers of Soledar, while shelling the settlement along with Bakhmut and Kostiantynivka. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed Ukrainian ammunition warehouses were destroyed in Soledar during these campaigns. On 20 May, a Russian missile had hit and damaged the Soledar Salt Mine. By the end of May, Russian forces had only advanced 4 kilometers towards Soledar.\n\nOn 1 June, Russian shelling killed one person and wounded two others. Shelling continued on 6 June. On 16 June, Russian forces attempted to advance towards Soledar, but made no notable gains. Fighting intensified in early July after the fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, with Russian forces shelling Soledar, Bakhmut, and nearby settlements on 3 July, along with advancing multiple kilometers.  Through the rest of July, shelling and small Russian assaults continued. On the night of 9–10 July, \"a dozen missiles\" struck the cultural center in Soledar, with fires burning for days, as no firefighters responded. The Vuhlehirska power plant was captured on 26 July, effectively making Soledar the next key target along that axis.\n\nBefore the invasion, there were 15,000 inhabitants in Soledar. By late July, there were around 2,000 people remaining. The Soledar Salt Mine, shelled many times, had closed.\n\nOn 2 August, prominent Ukrainian nationalist and military officer Andriy Zhovanyk died in battle near Soledar. Reportedly, he died while serving as a company commander of the 4th tactical group of the Right Sector Ukrainian Volunteer Corps.\n\nBattle\n\nInitial advances (3 August – 1 October 2022)\nOn 3 August, the Ukrainian army announced that Russian forces had begun an offensive against the settlement of Soledar. Russian forces began shelling Soledar, Bakhmut, and surrounding villages to the south and east of the settlements. Pro-Russian media claimed that the renewed offensive had breached defense lines to the east and southeast, although these claims were denied by Ukrainian officials. Later that week, Russian and separatist forces had taken partial-to-full control of the Knauf Gips Donbas gypsum factory southeast of the settlement center. On 10 August, Russian forces also advanced in the Bilokamyanskyi refractory plant. The separatists said they had entered Soledar proper on 11 August, but the Ukrainians did not confirm this. The fighting in Soledar was described in the media as \"grueling\" and typified by artillery duels between troops entrenched around strategic points, located near hedgerows and tree lines along swathes of farmland, all while civilians fled to underground shelters and basements to avoid bombardment.\n\nOn 16 August, airstrikes and ground engagements continued around Soledar, and the LPR separatists claimed to have controlled most of the settlement's industrial zone, but there was no evidence they had advanced beyond the gypsum factory. On 19 August, shelling and clashes between the Ukrainian defenders and elements of the LPR forces continued on the eastern outskirts of the settlement, as the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops were attacking from the Stryapivka and Volodymyrivka directions. The Ukrainian General Staff reported it repelled Russian assaults near Soledar on 27 August. Clashes near the gypsum plant continued by 31 August.\n\nOn 8 September, Ukraine said it repelled another Russian assault in Soledar, while Russian sources claimed that Russian and DPR forces had advanced into Soledar's residential areas and were clashing with Ukrainian defenders. On 10 September, Russian sources claimed that the Russians had captured several blocks of territory around the gypsum factory.\n\nFrontline stalls (2 October – 27 December 2022)\nRepeated local Russian assaults on or near Soledar continued into October, with the Ukrainian General Staff reporting it repelled numerous assaults on Soledar throughout the month. On 19–20 October, Russian sources reported ongoing clashes in Soledar's industrial zone and that Russian troops had made minimal gains in the last five days. On 22–24 October, Russian sources reported the capture of an unspecified key street in the Soledar direction amid reports of ongoing house-to-house clashes in the area, particularly on Soledar's southeastern outskirts. The claims of Russian gains were not independently verified at the time.\n\nClashes in the Soledar-Bakhmut area reportedly intensified in early November, as Wagner Group fighters attempted to break Ukrainian defense lines in the area, seeking to encapsulate Bakhmut. The Ukrainians said they were repelling dozens of Russian attacks per day as the Soledar-Bakhmut-Donetsk city front became the epicenter of fighting in Ukraine, according to Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar. Despite this, the Russians made no notable gains in Soledar by 8 November. Clashes along the Soledar-Bakhmut front continued into December, with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referring to the fighting on 3 December as \"the hottest, most painful. We do everything to help our boys in this direction.\"  On 14–16 December, Russian sources claimed that Wagner fighters had concluded clearing operations in Yakovlika, allowing for further assaults along Soledar's northeastern flank. The capture of Yakovlika prompted Ukraine to deploy a reserve battalion to Soledar to reinforce the front line, according to an LPR military officer.\n\nBy late December 2022, much of the fighting in the region centered around Bakhmut, with Soledar, located 15 kilometers from Bakhmut, seen as a satellite stronghold protecting the city's northeastern flank and supply lines. Much of Soledar had been reduced to ruins amid continuous Russian shelling, air strikes, and minor ground assaults against Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces captured the village of Bakhmutske, located along Soledar's southern flank, on 27 December. On 29 December, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksii Arestovych said Ukraine was suffering \"heavy troop losses\" along the Soledar-Bakhmut front, although insisted Russian assault troops were suffering even higher casualties.\n\nRussian breakthrough and capture (27 December 2022 – 16 January 2023)\nFollowing the capture of Bakhmutske on 27 December, Russian forces, spearheaded by Wagner Group fighters, began storming Soledar from the south and east. In January 2023, the last 500 civilians, mostly elderly, began fleeing Soledar. Russian sources claimed that Russian forces seized the  on the southern outskirts of Soledar on 4 January 2023. On 5 January, the Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have pushed Ukrainian forces back to the Soledar Salt Mine, although this claim could not be independently verified at the time. The Ukrainian General Staff claimed there were seventy-six artillery assaults on Soledar on 7 January alone, with the 46th Airmobile Brigade in charge of defending much of the settlement. On 9 January, Ukrainian Colonel Yuriy Yurchik was killed by artillery fire while defending Soledar.\n\nBetween 10–13 January, the Russian defence ministry and Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin repeatedly claimed Russian forces had fully captured Soledar, especially after securing portions of Soledar's center, however the Ukrainian defence ministry continued to deny Russian control of the settlement, stating that pockets of resistance still existed in the center, and that Ukraine still held on to the western portion of Soledar, including the Sil railway station. Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar wrote that \"battles continue [in Soledar]\", and said Ukrainian fighters were \"bravely trying to maintain the defence.\" Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy thanked the 46th and 77th Airmobile Brigades for their defense of the settlement. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), an American think tank and war observer, reported that Russia had likely captured Soledar proper on 11 January and were conducting clearing operations by 12 January. On 14 January, the ISW reported that Ukrainian elements still controlled some territory within Soledar's administrative borders, particularly a mine (known as mine #7) on the westernmost outskirts of the settlement, but no longer held positions within Soledar proper. The ISW could not confirm who controlled the Sil railway station at the time. Ukraine's 46th Airmobile Brigade said their troops were surrounded but were resisting Russian advance into Soledar's northwestern edge.\n\nOn 16 January, The Kyiv Independent reported that Russian troops had full control over the administrative territory of Soledar, citing a Ukrainian military source. Ukrainian drone unit commander Robert \"Madyar\" Brovdi confirmed that Russia had captured Soledar's last industrial zone, located near mine #7. Ukraine did not officially confirm the loss of Soledar until 25 January, when Ukrainian authorities stated their troops had retreated from the front line settlement.\n\nCasualties and humanitarian impact \n\nOn 9 January 2023, two British nationals working with a humanitarian aid agency, Andrew Bagshaw and Christopher Parry, went missing while driving from Kramatorsk to Soledar. On 11 January, Wagner Group said the body of one of the aid workers was found and passports belonging to both of them were discovered with the body. On 24 January they were reported by their families to have been killed when their car was hit by an artillery shell.\n\nMilitary casualties \nIn January 2023, in an interview with CNN, a Ukrainian soldier from the 46th Airmobile Brigade revealed that the death toll was very high and the ranks of Ukrainian troops were being replenished. He added that \"in Soledar, no one counts the dead\". \n\nOn 11 January, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak described the fighting ongoing at Bakhmut and Soledar as the bloodiest since the start of the invasion. On 12 January, Yevgeny Prigozhin claimed Wagner forces had killed around 500 Ukrainian soldiers in Soledar. On 13 January, Ukraine claimed to have killed over 100 Russian soldiers in the Soledar area using various special forces actions, artillery fire, anti-tank units, and a Tochka-U missile. Ukrainian troops claimed that Wagner fighters were lightly armed and suffered heavy losses during daily assaults. One Ukrainian soldier alleged that 10-15 Russians died per day at one point during the battle.\n\nRIA FAN, a pro-Russian media outlet linked to Prighozin, reported on 21 January that Wagner planned to return the bodies of Ukrainian soldiers killed in Soledar back to Ukrainian authorities.\n\nOn 25 January, Ukrainian military spokesman Serhiy Cherevatyi said no Ukrainian troops were captured during the battle.\n\nImpact on civilians \nBy 13 January 2023, the Ukrainian regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said that \"559 civilians including 15 children\" remained in Soledar and could not be evacuated.\n\nThe OCHA announced on 20 January that it delivered humanitarian aid to 800 people near Soledar, offloading the supplies in Ukrainian-controlled territory. The OCHA did not give an exact location of the convoy's destination nor explain how it secured the safety of the convoy, only that it came from Dnipro and that both the Ukrainians and Russians were notified in advance. It was the first such delivery to the area by an international body since the invasion.\n\nAnalysis\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank that has monitored the Russian invasion of Ukraine, assessed on 8 August 2022 that Russian forces were likely seeking to envelop Bakhmut by capturing Soledar, located north of the city, and Zaitseve, south of Bakhmut. The Russians wanted to set conditions to disrupt Ukrainian control over the T0513 trunk road that supports Ukrainian frontline positions in northeast Donetsk Oblast, the ISW continued.\n\nFollowing the capture of Bakhmutske and lack of momentum in Bakhmut in late December 2022, analysts believed Russia would transfer troops to launch an attack on Soledar in early January 2023. On 10 January 2023, the British Ministry of Defence stated that Russia \"likely\" controlled almost all of Soledar, and the top Russian priority was control of the tunnels leading into the Soledar Salt Mine. On 13 January, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov called the fighting \"very difficult\" and said aggressive tactics by PMC Wagner mercenaries resulted in high casualties. Reznikov said he believed Wagner was fighting for control of the mineral wealth offered by the mines in the region. RFE/RL correspondent Maryan Kushnir, embedded with a Ukrainian assault battalion during the battle, described the Soledar battle as a \"flanking fight\" amid freezing temperatures and frozen ground.\n\nIn January 2023, analysts dismissed the strategic value of Soledar, assessing that a Russian victory in the settlement would be pyrrhic at best. John Kirby of the U.S. National Security Council, who supports Ukraine, said on 12 January that \"even if both Bakhmut and Soledar fall to the Russians, it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself\". The Kyiv Independent reported on 22 January that the fall of Soledar was at least tactically significant and jeopardized Ukrainian positions defending Bakhmut's northern flank and supply routes.\n\nSee also \n Battle of Bakhmut\n List of military engagements during the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nReferences\n\nBattles in 2022\nBattles in 2023\nBattles of the Russian invasion of Ukraine\nMay 2022 events in Ukraine\nJune 2022 events in Ukraine\nJuly 2022 events in Ukraine\nAugust 2022 events in Ukraine\nSeptember 2022 events in Ukraine\nOctober 2022 events in Ukraine\nNovember 2022 events in Ukraine\nDecember 2022 events in Ukraine\nJanuary 2023 events in Ukraine\n21st century in Donetsk Oblast\nEastern Ukraine offensive\nBattles involving the Donetsk People's Republic\nBattles involving the Luhansk People's Republic\nWagner Group\nBattle", "unikey": "Battle of Soledar", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Battle", "Casualties_and_humanitarian_impact", "Analysis", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["During theeastern Ukraine campaignin theRussian invasion of Ukraine, Russian and separatist forces set their sights on seizing theDonbasregion, consisting ofDonetskandLuhanskoblasts.

invocations of the negotiation process to isolate ukraine from partner support putin has routinely framed ukraine as refusing concessions and likely seeks to use any ceasefire and negotiation window to allow russian troops time to reconstitute and relaunch operations thus depriving ukraine of the initiative a ceasefire agreement that occurs soon enough to allow russian forces to rest and refit this winter is extremely unlikely russia and ukraine are currently opposed to one another on the terms of any such agreement and it is highly unlikely that russian and ukrainian officials will agree to a ceasefire let alone implement one for some months russian forces will likely not have the opportunity to pause ukrainian winter counteroffensives and reset before spring key takeaways the kremlin is likely attempting to increase perceptions of putins competence and of that of the russian ministry of defense by publicizing putins meeting with the joint headquarters of the russian armed forces and putins appearances at nonmilitary events anew york timesinvestigation of russian military documents from early in the war supports isws longstanding assessments about how flawed russian planning assumptions and campaign design decisions plagued russias invasion of ukraine from its onset ongoing russian offensive operations around bakhmut are further driving a wedge between forces of the donetsk peoples republic and yevgeny prigozhins wagner group troops the us central intelligence agency assesses that the kremlin is not serious about negotiations with ukraine agreeing with a longstanding isw assessment ukrainian forces conducted counterattacks near svatove and kreminna and continue to strike russian rear areas russian forces continued offensive operations near bakhmut and avdiivkadonetsk city ukrainian officials warned that russian forces may be attempting to draw ukrainian forces into a trap on the east left bank of the dnipro river russia may be conducting an information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations on the demilitarization of the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to a prospective future ukrainian counteroffensive in zaporizhia oblast several russian sources denounced a military commissars claim that russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers an extension of the legal mandatory service period would not be necessary to keep current conscripts in the field however as all former conscripts are reservists and all reservists are already eligible for mobilization we do not report in detail on russian war crimes because those activities are wellcovered in western media and do not directly affect the military operations we are assessing and forecasting we will continue to evaluate and report on the effects of these criminal activities on the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed

opytne 3km south of bakhmut and andriivka 10km southwest of bakhmut russian forces continued offensive operations along the western outskirts of donetsk city on december 17 the ukrainian general staff

positions and secure rear areas against ukrainian strikes ukrainian officials warned that russian forces may be attempting to draw ukrainian forces into a trap on the east left bank of the dnipro

of the east bank of the dnipro river and that russian forces have been telling locals that they will fully withdraw from the kakhovka area by the new yearit is very unlikely that russian forces would be able to fake a withdrawal without ukrainian forces detecting the deception ukrainian forces continued to strike russian rear areas in southern ukraine the ukrainian general staff reported that ukrainian strikes against russian force concentrations in tokmak and polohy zaporizhia oblast wounded over 100 russian military personnel and destroyed an ammunition depot on december 15 russian forces continued artillery rocket and missile strikes against areas in southern ukraine on december 17 russian and ukrainian sources reported that russian forces continued to conduct rocket and artillery strikes against frontline areas in zaporizhia oblast west of hulyaipole russia may be conducting a new information operation falsely connecting ongoing negotiations regarding the demilitarization of the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp with a prospective future ukrainian counteroffensive in zaporizhia oblast a russian milblogger claimed on december 17 that ukraine seeks to force russia to demilitarize the znpp using diplomatic means in order to reduce russian forces ability to defend against a prospective ukrainian counteroffensive towards melitopol zaporizhia oblastsuch an information operation likely intends to undermine the ongoing negotiations with the international atomic energy agency to establish a security zone around the znpp as well as ukraines status as the legitimate operator of the znpp note isw will report on activities in kherson oblast as part of the southern axis in this and subsequent updates ukraines counteroffensive in rightbank kherson oblast has accomplished its stated objectives so isw will not present a southern ukraine counteroffensive section until ukrainian forces resume counteroffensives in southern ukraine mobilization and force generation effortsrussian objective expand combat power without conducting general mobilization several russian sources denounced a moscow oblast military commissars claim that russian authorities will extend the service period for conscript soldiers from 12 months to 18 for spring 2023 conscripts and two years for fall 2023 conscripts on december 17any legal attempt to extend the general term of service for conscripts would be both extremely unpopular with russian domestic audienceseven those who support the warbut is also unnecessary if the kremlin desires to keep conscripts fighting beyond their mandatory service periodsrussian law designates former conscripts as reservists following their term of conscript service and all reservists are eligible for immediate mobilization under current russian law the combination of war and sanctions seems to be starting to generate considerable dislocation of the russian labor market russian prime minister mikhail mishustin adopted temporary measures attempting to mitigate the impact of the war and western sanctions on the russian labor market on december 17the combination of russian measures to address layoffs and ongoing labor shortages suggests that russia struggles to support a balanced distribution of labor across industries facing a shortage in some areas and a surplus in areas that now lack support capacity russian authorities continue efforts to use civilian donations and mandated contributions to finance the war despite common civilian financial hurdles just russia party leader sergei mironov called for the russian government to begin issuing federal war bonds at an interest rate of 2 russian forces continue attempts to discourage desertion through threats of punishment an opensource intelligence aggregator posted an intercepted call on december 17 in which a russian wife warns her soldier husband that russian authorities gather russian soldiers who lay down their weapons and deploy them straight to the frontlines western sources continue to confirm that russian units that were widely considered to be elite prior to the extension of the war in february have suffered significant losses in ukrainethe washington postreported on december 16 the 200th separate motorized rifle brigade of the 14th army corps of the northern fleet joint strategic command sustained devastating casualties as one of the first russian units to assault kharkiv city in the early phases of the war and was destroyed russian authorities continue to struggle to monitor mobilized soldiers a russian opposition news source reported on december 16 that moscow police apprehended a mobilized soldier from nizhny novgorod walking through the moscow metro carrying weapons he received in october russian forces appear to be facing logistical hurdles in an effort to gather military equipment in mariupol due to personnel inefficiency and incompetence ukrainian mariupol mayoral advisor

russian invasion of ukraine this map is updated daily alongside the static maps present in this report russian force generation efforts combined with western sanctions are having longterm damaging effects on the russian economy as isw has previously forecastedfinancial experts toldreutersthat the kremlin will face a budget deficit that will drain moscows reserves to their lowest level in years due to projected decreases in energy revenue sanctions and the cost of russian mobilization the kremlin is continuing to rely heavily on financially incentivizing russians to fight in ukraine which will likely continue to strain the russian economy for decadesrussian officials have been promising salaries to volunteers and mobilized men that are more than twice the average russian civilian salary before and during russias fullscale invasion of ukraine the kremlin is already facing challenges in delivering promised compensation challenges that are increasing social tensions within russian societyrussian telegram channels released footage of mobilized men in ulyanovsk protesting payment issues russian president vladimir putins calls for a competitive russian military industry are divorced from the reality of russian supply chain and defense industrial base issuesputin stressed on november 2 during a meeting of the coordinating council for the russian armed forces that it is important that the russian government ensures active competition between russian military arms manufacturersrussia has likely negotiated the weapon shipments with iran and north korea because it has significantly depleted its stock of munitions in air missile and artillery strikes over the course of the war in ukraine and cannot readily restock them russias reliance on isolated and heavily sanctioned states for critical weapons systems does not support putins demand that the russian military industry becomes highly competitive and meets the needs of the russian armed forces in any short period of time russian officials announced that occupation authorities began integrating the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp into the jurisdiction of russian nuclear power plant operator rosenergoatom on november 2as of this publication the international atomic energy agency iaea has not issued a statement condemning the formally announced illegal russian takeover of the operation of the znpp or addressed the likelihood that russia will demand formal iaea recognition of russian control over the znpp and thereby de facto recognition of the russian annexation of occupied ukrainian territory russian and belarusian officials continue to highlight bilateral defense cooperation between russia and belarus as a means of perpetuating the longstanding information operation that belarus will enter the war in ukraine on behalf of russia belarus entry into the war remains highly unlikely as isw has previously assessedbelarusian defense minister viktor khrenin announced on november 2 that russia and belarus held the annual meeting of the joint board of the ministries of defense with the purpose of strengthening the joint military potential of the russiabelarus union state to counter challenges and threats of a military nature posed by natothe meeting of the joint board of the ministries of defense is therefore a continuation of a concerted effort on the part of both belarus and russia to perpetuate an information operation that presents the threat of the union state as imminent in order to pin ukrainian troops against the northern border and pollute the information space key takeaways russian force generation efforts combined with western sanctions are having longterm damaging effects on the russian economy as isw has previously forecasted russian president vladimir putins calls for a competitive russian military industry are divorced from the reality of russian supply chain and defense industrial base issues russian officials announced that occupation authorities began integrating the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp into russian jurisdiction russian and belarusian officials continue to perpetuate the longstanding information operation that belarus will enter the war in ukraine on behalf of russia but belarus entry into the war remains highly unlikely as isw has previously assessed russian sources claimed that ukrainian

continued defensive operations along the dnipro river while ukrainian forces continued their interdiction campaign russian forces continued to conduct ground assaults near bakhmut and donetsk city russian forces continued mobilization efforts and advertising for volunteer battalions while struggling with low morale russian occupation authorities continued to forcibly relocate kherson oblast

the ukrainian military and population and specifically on combat in ukrainian urban areas we utterly condemn these russian violations of the laws of armed conflict geneva conventions and humanity even

oblast with drones a russian source expressed continued concern that ukrainian forces are preparing to imminently launch a counteroffensive on the zaporizhia oblast front lineukrainian officials have made no concrete statements about a ukrainian counteroffensive in zaporizhia oblast and have certainly not been conducting an information operation to that effect that isw has been able to observe it is more likely that russian milbloggers have run an information operation on themselves by constantly repeating warnings of an imminent attack russian and ukrainian sources traded accusations of shelling the zaporizhzhia thermal power plant in enerhodar temporarily cutting power to the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant znpp on october 7 mobilization and force generation effortsrussian objective expand combat power without conducting general mobilization isw cannot confirm how representative ongoing anecdotal reports of poor conditions for mobilized personnel are of the experience of the 300000 or more mobilized russian men however the prevalence of those anecdotes in the russian information space is damaging the kremlin by continuing to fuel the accurate narrative of kremlin and mod incompetence poor conditions could also be a driving force behind reported defections surrenders and strikes by mobilized personnel ukrainian intelligence officials told reporters that over 2000 russians contacted ukraines i want to live surrender hotline since partial mobilization was announced on september 21 the russian ministry of defense mod attempted to defend itself from popular criticism of its training of mobilized personnel by sharing the announcement of a new russian center for mobilization training on october 7the new center will provide educational activities for additional professional programs in the field of mobilization training and mobilization per the government decree but is capped at 69 employeesan absurdly small number of trainers for the 300000 men that the mod claims it will mobilize under partial mobilization the announcement is primarily a public relations stunt that will not alter russian force generation capabilities in the coming months the center is not subordinated to the mod but rather to the main directorate for special programs of the president of the russian federation which is technically in charge of mobilization the centers existence may or may not affect the kremlins longterm ability to mobilize more capable personnel but is extraordinarily unlikely to improve those capabilities in the short term due to the ongoing bureaucratic incompetence of the mod and its demonstrated shortages of training personnel russian officials offered basic concessions for mobilized men and their families on october 7 but continue to rely on local governments and other nonfederal institutions to provide support including food and training to newly mobilized men russian president vladimir putin signed two laws on october 7 exempting mobilized personnel and other participants in his special military operation from accruing penalties for late payments for housing communal services loans and credit card debtsthe union reported that veterans and specialists are currently developing a curriculum and that they are receiving support from other veterans groups the union claimed that it hopes to spread the initiative to kursk oblast some russian citizens continued to express their dissatisfaction with russias partial mobilization on october 67 social media users circulated a video of a man who lit two cars on fire in moscow on october 6 using molotov cocktails while shouting antiwar slogans the ukrainian general staff reported on october 7 that russian occupation authorities in donetsk oblast are continuing to forcibly mobilize civilians belying russian claims that residents of newlyannexed territories will not be mobilizedthe men had previously obtained russian passports through an accelerated citizenship

abuses further confirming isws previous assessments that the atrocities uncovered in bucha izyum and elsewhere were not isolated war crimes but rather a microcosm of russian atrocities throughout russianoccupied areashe reported that russian forces used electric shocks severe beatings suffocation and tearing out fingernails as common methods of torture against local civilians isw nonresident fellow nataliya bugayova warned in april 2022 that bucha is an observable microcosm of a deliberate russian terror campaign against ukrainians similar intentional atrocities are happening throughout russianoccupied areas in ukraineukrainian officials will likely continue to find evidence of russian war crimes and atrocities as ukrainian forces liberate occupied areas russian occupation officials have likely failed to repair necessary civilian infrastructure in occupied and illegally annexed parts of ukraine as winter approaches and temperatures drop risking a humanitarian catastrophe ukraines resistance center reported on october 7 that occupation authorities have left half of occupied zaporizhia oblast without heating after failing to repair or build new natural gas pipelinesthe center assessed that russian authorities may not begin work on restoring natural gas supplies to parts of zaporizhia oblast until the spring ukrainian officials continued to encourage partisan activity in russias illegallyannexed and occupied ukrainian regions gur representativevadym skibitsky stated on october 7 that ukrainian partisan activity will only intensify in russianoccupied parts of the country and emphasized that ukrainian law allows for partisan activityskibitsky emphasized that the gur sees a strong partisan movement in crimea kherson and zaporizhia oblasts where partisans are not

soledar a salt mine town in eastern ukraine as kyiv rejected the claims should russian troops indeed take the town it would mark moscows first gain in the donbas for months  potentially offering president vladimir putin some welcome news after a recent string of humiliating setbacks on the battlefield the significance of soledar in military terms is minimal and largely symbolic however its capture if confirmed would allow russian forces and especially the wagner mercenary group to turn their focus on nearby bakhmut which has been a target since the summer taking soledar would also represent a pr win for the man who runs wagner  oligarch yevgeny prigozhin who has frequently criticized the russian defense ministrys management of the special military operation in ukraine heres what you need to know about soledar video ad feedback we cant take it any longer cnn speaks to ukrainians living on front line 0200  source cnn as has often been the case with battlefield gains and losses there are conflicting reports from russian and ukrainian sides about the success of russias advance into the town the russian defense ministry said the capture of soledar became possible due to the constant destruction of the enemy by assault and army aviation missile troops and artillery of a group of russian forces they continuously inflicted concentrated strikes on the positions of the armed forces of ukraine in the city forbidding the transfer of reserves the supply of ammunition as well as attempts by the enemy to retreat to other lines of defense a statement read the russian mod made no reference to wagner claims that the private military company had conducted the operation exclusively themselves the complex of measures implemented by the russian group of troops ensured the successful offensive operations of the assault detachments to liberate soledar over the past three days alone more than 700 ukrainian servicemen and over 300 units of weapons of the armed forces of ukraine have been destroyed near the city of soledar the ministry added alexander shatov the head of the russiabacked administration in shakhtyorsk in the selfproclaimed donetsk peoples republic said moscows forces had evacuated about 100 people from soledar to the town he told russian state news agency ria novosti that 110 more people were expected to arrive friday however serhii cherevatyi spokesman for the eastern group of the ukrainian armed forces told cnn that russian troops do not control soledar a ukrainian solider stationed in the city of bakhmut told cnn that kyivs units are still at the western outskirts of soledar taras berezovets a captain in the ukrainian special forces first brigade said remaining in soledar made no military sense because it was completely destroyed he said he believed a decision to withdraw would be made in the coming days but said it would be up to the general staff to make any such decision he added that morale among frontline units was high he said his comrades in other units understood that the mission was to hold on as long as they could and kill as many fighters of the wagner group as possible and that much of the fighting over the last two weeks had involved street fighting in soledar between small units of four to eight fighters berezovets said that ukrainian forces continued to inflict heavy casualties on the russians he claimed that a captured wagner fighter had told interrogators that only three out of 35 men in his platoon had survived he had no knowledge of any ukrainian troops being trapped in soledar and said units had been successfully withdrawn to the western outskirts close to the railway station libkosap a cnn team just outside of soledar reported ongoing mortar and rocket fire on friday afternoon after russia claimed it had captured the town soledar lies at the center of the donbas region the vast expanse of eastern ukraine whose capture russia has prized above all other regions since last summer indeed moscow regards it as russian territory since claiming illegally that it had annexed all of the donetsk region  including the approximately 40 that lies outside russian control it is just a few miles northeast of the larger city of bakhmut which has become perhaps the most contested and kinetic part of the 1300kilometer 800 mile front line in ukraine and the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the war soledar has therefore been a target for russian forces since last may with a prewar population of about 10000 it has little strategic value in itself but is a waypoint in the russians attritional slog westwards moscow has struggled for months to attack bakhmut from the east but were it to capture soledar moscow would at least be able to approach the city from a different path the russian defense ministry said friday that the capture of the town is important for the continuation of successful offensive operations in the donetsk region the ministry added that establishing control over soledar makes it possible to cut off the supply routes for ukrainian troops in bakhmut the area around soledar includes large salt mines which belong to state enterprise artemsil the biggest producer of salt in europe which halted production shortly after russias invasion last february the area surrounding the town hosts extensive reserves of very pure salt that have only been exploited on an industrial scale since 1881 according to the european route of industrial heritage some have speculated that the russians  and wagners leader prigozhin  have eyed soledar for its huge resources of gypsum prigozhin has used wagner in africa and syria as a mercenary force to leverage access to resources including diamonds and oil but exploiting soledars famed salt mines would require heavy investment and a more tranquil environment than at present prigozhin has said the vast network of tunnels created by the mining offers unique and historic defenses and a network of underground cities the russian armed forces have had nothing to celebrate since the beginning of july and have had to retreat in both kharkiv to the north and kherson in southern ukraine the capture of soledar despite its nowruined state would therefore be rare progress but it would be symbolic rather than substantive the institute for the study of war isw says control of soledar will not necessarily allow russian forces to exert control over critical ukrainian ground lines of communication into bakhmut the larger prize even taking the most generous russian claims at face value the capture of soledar would not portend an immediate encirclement of bakhmut the think tank added ap as russias military stalls putins chef serves up his wagner shock troops to rescue ukraine campaign but soledar is of outsize significance to one man prigozhin his wagner fighters many of them former prison inmates have taken heavy casualties with one wave after another of ground assaults across what has become a battlefield of trenches and mud reminiscent of world war i after months in which the russian ministry of defense has delivered nothing but retreat prigozhin is keen to show that his men deliver late tuesday prigozhin said wagner pmc detachments have taken control of the entire territory of soledar the city center is like a cauldron where urban fighting is taking place and he added i would like to stress that no units other than wagner pmc operatives were involved in the storming of soledar the subtext of soledar is the battle for influence and resources between prigozhin and his nemeses at the defense ministry which is intensifying as prigozhin continues to deride what he calls the corrupt and incompetent military hierarchy a top ukrainian official on friday characterized infighting among different factions of the russian power establishment as a good sign of the beginning of the stunning end mykhailo podolyak an adviser in the office of the ukrainian president tweeted that a public rumble had begun between the russian defense ministry and militarycriminal ultras like progozhin and general sergei surovikin roman chopap the ukrainian tactic could be to invite wave after wave of infantry attacks knowing they can inflict heavy casualties on the enemy a tactic used with success in vuhledar late last year ukraines command would then choose a moment to withdraw to bakhmut ukraines 46th brigade alluded to this tactic in an online post on tuesday saying the situation is very difficult but manageable we only abandon what we consider inexpedient to keep trying to hold soledar  like trying to hold lysychansk the last holdout in the luhansk region last summer  becomes inexpedient when casualties rise and resupply becomes near impossible ukraine has defense in depth throughout the parts of donetsk it still holds  and has forced the russians to expend huge amounts of munitions to make marginal progress this story has been updated related ad

russias fault lines by james horncastle updated march 18 2023 ukrainian service members fire a howitzer m119 at a front line near the city of bakhmut oleksandr ratushniak  reuters the fight for the city of bakhmut in eastern ukraine which started in the summer of 2022 continues unabated the battle has morphed from one of dubious immediate strategic benefit to russia into one that has come to symbolize its war efforts it also highlights the current deficiencies in russias armed forces symbolism is not new to warfare the battle of stalingrad although it had strategic calculations was also important due to hitlers fixation on its symbolic value furthermore symbolic acts can have strategic impact beyond their immediate military concerns the problem is when symbolism overtakes sensible strategy bakhmut from a strictly military standpoint does not significantly change the war for ukraine however bakhmuts defense is aligned with president volodymyr zelenskyys arguments that he will accept nothing less than the full restoration of his country russia despite superior military capabilities has so far failed to take the city urban warfare favors defenders because they possess an intimate knowledge of the terrain that aggressors dont furthermore when an army relies on artillery and tactical bombing to the extent that the russian army does it risks creating new enemy defensive positions in the rubble of the others theyve destroyed this is a lesson the russian army has had to relearn multiple times especially in chechnya and forgotten once more to overcome these problems an army must rely upon its infantry and its officers initiative to carry the day in the case of the russian armed forces with their centralized command system plummeting morale and abysmal equipment standards this isnt possible news bakhmuts capture key to further offensive in ukraine  russia read more nevertheless bakhmut has become the focus of russias efforts russias arguments for the war in ukraine  including whether it actually considers the conflict a war at all  have shifted over time a consistent thread however is that the invasion was aimed at protecting ukraines ethnic russianspeaking population bakhmut is in what russia considers the donetsk peoples republic an area of ukraine with a significant ethnic russian population for russiato claim victory it must control the ukrainian regions of donetsk and luhansk at the minimum these two regions together make up the donbas a region that is of cultural significance to russian identity soviet propaganda from the 1920s in fact identified the region as the heart of russia russian president vladimir putin as a result cannot easily suffer setbacks in the region studies on how the war is affecting putins popularity are admittedly problematic what is known however is that putin relies on the support of russian nationalists to maintain his position and taking the donbas is crucial for that base thats why russia continues its efforts in bakhmut and the surrounding region despite ukraine alleging that between 1000020000 russian troops have already died there these casualties are magnified by the divisions within russias political establishment putin succeeded in establishing a system where overlapping responsibilities mean that he ultimately acts as the arbiter of power while that system is effective in maintaining putins position in russian politics it has some severe disadvantages news in photos russian forces inch forward in bakhmut at terrible human cost read more this is most notably evident in the case of the wagner group the countrys main mercenary organization which was created to allow moscow to embark upon military action abroad while maintaining plausible deniability since the russian invasion of ukraine however the wagner group has becomea defacto branch of russias regular armed forces wagner founder yevgeny prigozhin recognizes that the organizations success will bring him personal power within russia and in order to achieve this goal he has reduced a former highly trained force to one that relies on human wave tactics and employs former prisoners human wave tactics involve an army sending large numbers of soldiers to overwhelm an opponents defense and by their nature cause the attacker to suffer significant casualties the rapid increase in the wagner groups size however means that it needs considerably more resources than in the past the wagner groups need for supplies brings it into direct competition with the russian army prigozhin has publicly condemned russian army officials alleging that they are not adequately supplying his forces the russian armed forces understandably resent this argument given their own supply problems the result of this competition is two nominally allied armies rapidly trying to achieve success in a battle that requires patience and precision one is liberally using explosives and the other soldiers lives to achieve victory the lack of efficacy of both tactics has furthered the mutual loathing between the parties the battle of bakhmut as a result embodies russias illplanned adventure in ukraine even if russian forces succeed in taking bakhmut the losses they have suffered and the divisions they have created within the armed forces will hang like a specter over their efforts for the remainder of the war the

decree on october 19 seeking to address russian military personnels ongoing concerns about timely paymentsputin likely signed the decree to prevent further social tensions from forming as a result of payment concerns putin also likely placed the responsibility for timely payments partially on russian defense minister sergey shoigu whom putin named in his decree so that shoigu would bear the brunt of public criticism if the issue of timely payments persists russian officials noted that russia has not completed partial mobilization as of october 19 kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov stated on october 19 that putin has not yet decided to issue a statement concerning the completion of partial mobilizationrussian officials are likely to announce the completion of mobilization efforts to appease public opinion while still mobilizing at least some personnel under putins partial mobilization orders prior to putins declaration that will formally end mobilization for now russian authorities likely need to end largescale mobilization efforts by early november to free up bureaucratic capacity for the autumn conscription cycle which begins november 1 the russian parliament proposed legal measures that would allow russian authorities to minimize the domestic impacts of partial mobilization in potential future mobilization waves the state duma held closed door sessions on the passage of 11 bills concerning mobilization efforts on october 19the state duma likely introduced the bills to minimize the domestic criticism that arose during mobilization efforts while also preparing clearer guidelines for future mobilization efforts the bills are unlikely to prevent russian authorities from continuing to mobilize a wide section of the russian public during the current period of partial mobilization russian military officials continued to forcibly mobilize ukrainian residents of russianoccupied territories to labor or fight on behalf of the russian military the ukrainian general staff reported on october 19 that russian forces continue the forced mobilization of residents in russianoccupied kherson oblast and to instruct forcibly mobilized residents to construct fortifications around kherson cityrussian forces will likely continue to forcibly mobilize residents in russianoccupied territories in ukraine as ukrainian counteroffensives progress russian

received two or three days of training before their deployment died soon after arriving in ukrainerussian military officials will likely continue to prioritize filling depleted units with mobilized personnel over providing proper training and equipment for newly mobilized servicemen a russian source claimed that russian women are increasingly volunteering for military servicerussian officials may be pursuing the reported increased recruitment of russian women to mimic ukrainian force generation efforts that have more widely opened military service to ukrainian women since 2014 and have

from his company despite the enormous and constantly growing need for highprecision and longrange rifles to sustain the war effort in ukraine noting that shoigu should add that to his report lobayev added that the government only commissioned one state order with the company and noted that private sponsors and nongovernment crowdfunding organizations place 999 of all orders in support of the russian special military operation in ukraine lobayev noted that private sponsors include some governors and members of the government who pay for this equipment with their own funds and acknowledged that his post will likely upset higherups the kremlins treatment of lobayev arms resembles its offhand information space approach to its handling of the wagner group lobayev arms was established in 2013 and is an offspring of a small arms company called tsar pushka tsar cannon which previously moved to the united arab emirates following the kremlins decision to decline the renewal of its license in 2010 lobayev just like wagner group financier yevheniy prigozhin is likely exploiting the criticism wave among milbloggers to benefit their private businesses the kremlin in turn is attempting to appease these individuals by allowing them a prominent position in the russian information space while refraining from elevating them to an official status the kremlin may be refraining from publicly affiliating with lobayev arms in an effort to deprive lobayev of the legitimacy and business benefits associated with working with the russian mod despite reportedly failing to properly equip its mobilized servicemen isw had previously observed that russian airborne units used lobayev armaments over the summer and russian milbloggers claimed that russian leadership deliberately prevented proxy formations from using lobayev sniper rifles as these units suffered an acute shortage of advanced weaponsprigozhin is also criticizing the russian military command in an ongoing effort to legalize his mercenary organization in russia even as the kremlin continues to snub these efforts despite wagner groups involvement in putins war in ukraine russian businessmen may continue to use the social media algorithms and lack of credible official war coverage to their advantage while inadvertently undermining the kremlins core institutions and putins regime a prominent milblogger observed that his critiques of the russian military command receive millions of views warning that the algorithm may lead some individuals to exaggerate their criticism to benefit their agendasthe kremlins monthslong appeasement of the prowar milblogger community may continue to give rise to financial and political incentives to criticize the russian mod which can reflect poorly on putins leadership activity in russianoccupied areasrussian objective consolidate administrative control of and annexed areas forcibly integrate ukrainian civilians into russian sociocultural economic military and governance systems russian occupation authorities continued to take measures to resolve administrative issues associated with consolidating russian control of occupied territories on january 4 a russian
