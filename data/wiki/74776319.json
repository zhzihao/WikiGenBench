{"id": 74776319, "key": "NBA on television in the 2020s", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA%20on%20television%20in%20the%202020s", "text": "The following is a general overview of the National Basketball Association (NBA) on television in the 2020s. There have been no new national media contracts during this period. Locally three NBA teams, the Los Angeles Clippers, Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns, moved all or some of their games from regional sports networks to over-the-air television networks.\n\n2019–2020\n\nNational\nThis was the fourth year of the current nine-year contracts with ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV.\n\nLocal\nUnder an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the Fox Sports Regional Networks were required to be sold off to third parties by June 18, 2019. Fox also invoked a clause to give Yankee Global Enterprises the rights to buy their stake back in the YES Network, which aired the local broadcasts to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. Including YES, the Fox Sports Regional Networks held the local TV rights to a combined total of 44 NHL, NBA, and MLB teams. On March 8, YES was sold to a consortium including Yankee Global Enterprises, Amazon, and Sinclair Broadcast Group for $3.5 billion. Then on May 3, Sinclair and Entertainment Studios agreed to purchase the rest of the Fox Sports Regional Networks. The networks continued to temporarily use the Fox Sports name under a transitional license agreement while Sinclair explored re-branding options.\n\n2020–2021\n\nNational\nThis is the fifth year of the current nine-year contracts with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV.\n\nTo reduce on-site staff, ESPN and TNT will leverage the home team's rightsholder as a host broadcaster for some of their games. They will send a neutral \"world feed\" and other camera feeds to the network, which will then add commentary and surrounding coverage. ESPN and TNT are also deploying additional cameras specific to their broadcasts, and ESPN may provide a supplemental on-site presence if the local broadcaster does not have enough capacity to support the host model. ESPN stated that some (roughly half) of their games, particularly marquee games exclusive to ESPN and ABC, would be produced on-site with an existing hybrid model (where some producers and graphics operators work from ESPN's studios in Bristol, Connecticut). TNT also planned to begin doing some games on-site beginning with Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nLocal\nOn December 26, 2020, it was announced that Fox Sports Networks had acquired rights to simulcast 36 Toronto Raptors games locally in the Tampa Bay area through at least the first half of the season. All of the games will be carried via the Fox Sports Go app, with selected games to also air on television via Fox Sports Sun (15) and Fox Sports Florida (2).\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the Fox Sports Networks rebranded as Bally Sports, as part of an agreement between majority-owner Sinclair Broadcast Group and casino operator Bally's Corporation.\n\n2021–2022\n\nNational\nThis is the sixth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV. Beginning with this season, TNT moved its marquee Thursday doubleheaders to Tuesday nights starting with the season opener. The network will continue to air Thursday night doubleheaders, but only during opening week and beginning in January to avoid competing with Thursday Night Football. TNT aired a doubleheader on Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January 17) and the final day of the regular season (April 10).\n\nABC began its NBA Saturday Primetime early with a special game airing on December 11.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, the Warriors–Jazz matchup televised on ESPN was the first in the network's history to have an all women production team. Beth Mowins was the play-by-play commentator, with Doris Burke as analyst and Lisa Salters on the sideline; in addition, 33 other women handled production roles in Salt Lake City and in the ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut.\n\nIn Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, ESPN's lead play-by-play Mike Breen was out due to COVID-19 protocols, which resulted to Mark Jones replacing Breen on play-by-play. In Game 1 of the 2022 NBA Finals, analyst Jeff Van Gundy was also out for the same reason, leaving Jones, Mark Jackson, and sideline reporter Lisa Salters; they were together the first all-African-American broadcast team for an NBA Finals game. Van Gundy returned in Game 2, while Breen followed suit in Game 3.\n\nLocal\nThe Portland Trail Blazers signed a broadcasting deal with Root Sports Northwest, replacing NBC Sports Northwest as the team's game broadcasters.\n\n2022–2023\n\nNational\nThis is the seventh year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV. ESPN broadcasts Wednesday and Friday night games for most of the season, and games during selected Sunday nights from February to April. ABC airs NBA Saturday Primetime during eight games selected Saturday nights between December and March, with a tripleheader on January 28, the first tripleheader on the network outside of Christmas Day along with a Saturday afternoon game on January 14. The network also broadcasts NBA Sunday Showcase on three selected Sunday afternoons in February and early March. TNT airs Tuesday games all season, and Thursday games from January to April. NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when neither ESPN/ABC nor TNT are airing games nationally.\n\nFive Christmas Day games were scheduled for this season. ABC was originally scheduled to air just a tripleheader, but it was later decided that all five Christmas games would be simulcast across both ABC and ESPN for the first time, likely in an attempt to counterprogram the NFL's scheduling of a Christmas Day tripleheader for the first time. Previously, the most Christmas games that either network had ever aired in any given season was three.\n\nFour games were held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with TNT and NBA TV each airing two of them.\n\nThe NBA designed January 24–28 as \"NBA Rivals Week\", with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".\n\nOn March 8, ESPN had another all-female crew for an NBA game for the second straight year. The 7:30pm (ET) telecast between the Dallas Mavericks and the New Orleans Pelicans had Beth Mowins and Doris Burke as commentators, with Cassidy Hubbarth on the sideline, while the 10:00pm (ET) telecast between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers had Mike Breen and Mark Jackson as commentators, with reporter Ros Gold-Onwude joining the broadcast team as an analyst/color commentator.\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, April 9, two games with playoff implications were flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.\n\nLocal\nIn September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in NBC Sports Washington, which carries broadcasts of the Washington Wizards and the NHL's Washington Capitals, both Monumental-owned teams. Monumental initially took minority ownership of the network in 2016. NBC will provide transitional corporate, technical, and distribution support up to 18 months after the sale, and Monumental plans to rebrand the network after the 2022–23 season.\n\nIn October 2022, the Clippers announced an agreement with KTLA to air 15 games. The remaining games will continue to air on Bally Sports West. The Clippers also launched a direct-to-consumer streaming service called ClipperVision. The service includes all non-national games.\n\nOn February 24, 2023, the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks sent letters to the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz saying they had until March 31, 2023, to reach an agreement to take their local television rights back. Warner Bros. Discovery, the owners of the networks, intends to leave the regional sports networks business. If a deal is not reached the networks would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Portland Trail Blazers's deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network.\n\nOn March 14, Diamond Sports Group, the operator of the Bally Sports regional sports networks, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond plans to continue to broadcast games for the 16 NBA teams it has regional rights to while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization.\n\n2023–2024\n\nNational\nThis will be the eighth year of a nine-year deal with ABC, ESPN, TNT, and NBA TV, ESPN broadcasts Wednesday and Friday night games for most of the season, and games during selected Sunday nights from February to April. ABC is scheduled to air nine NBA Saturday Primetime games, including a tripleheader on January 27, over seven selected Saturdays between that January date and March. ABC will also have NBA Sunday Showcase on four selected Sunday afternoons in February and March, with three of them as doubleheaders. TNT airs Tuesday games all season, and Thursday games from January to April. NBA TV televises games primarily on Mondays all season, Saturday and Sunday nights for most of the season, Thursdays during the first half of the season, Fridays during the second half of the season, and any other time when neither ESPN/ABC nor TNT are airing games nationally.\n\nFive Christmas Day games are scheduled for this season. With Christmas Day falling on a Monday in 2023, the NFL also scheduled a Monday Night Football on that day. Because ABC/ESPN holds the broadcast rights to both NBA Christmas games and Monday Night Football, it was decided that ESPN will again air all five NBA games, but ABC will only simulcast two of them in favor of exclusively airing the Monday Night Football game. This would mark the first time since 2016 that ABC will televise fewer than three NBA Christmas games.\n\nFour Martin Luther King Jr. Day games will be televised nationally, with TNT and NBA TV airing two apiece.\n\nOn January 23–27, the league will hold \"NBA Rivals Week\" for the second consecutive season, with every nationally televised game featuring \"classic and budding rivalries between teams and players\".\n\nOn the final day of the regular season, April 14, two games with playoff implications will be flexed into ESPN's afternoon doubleheader.\n\nLocal\n\nThe Washington Wizards' broadcaster NBC Sports Washington is planned to be renamed as Monumental Sports Network prior to the start of the season. In September 2022, Ted Leonsis's Monumental Sports & Entertainment bought out NBCUniversal's ownership stake in the channel.\n\nThe 16 NBA teams who had deals with the Bally Sports regional sports networks may be affected by its operator Diamond Sports Group's March 14, 2023, decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Diamond had initially sought to continue broadcasting regional games while it plans to separate from majority parent Sinclair Broadcast Group as part of the reorganization. \n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Phoenix Suns signed a five-year agreement with Gray Television to replace Bally Sports Arizona as their broadcaster. Most Suns games would then be carried on broadcast television by Gray's KTVK, KPHO-TV, or KPHE-LD in Phoenix (as well as a Gray station in Tucson, and a new Gray station in Yuma to launch before the season starts). The Suns will also operate an over-the-top subscription service. After the announcement, Diamond accused the team of breaching its contract and bankruptcy law, stating that the team was making an \"improper effort\" to \"change their broadcasting partner without permitting Diamond to exercise our contractual rights.\" In response, Phoenix Suns CEO Josh Bartelstein stated that \"Diamond's position is totally inaccurate. We are moving forward with this deal and could not be more excited about what it means for our fans and our future.\" On May 10, 2023, the bankruptcy judge voided the Suns contract with Gray, ruling that the Suns violated Bally Sports Arizona's contractual right of first refusal. He ordered the parties into arbitration. On July 14, 2023, the deal became official when Diamond declined to match Gray's contract offer.\n\nIn February 2023, Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was winding down its AT&T SportsNet regional sports network business, affecting the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz's broadcasters, AT&T SportsNet Southwest and AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain, respectively. The Portland Trail Blazers' deal with Root Sports Northwest is not affected because Warner Bros. Discovery only has minority control of that network. On June 20, 2023, the Jazz reached an agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group owned stations KJZZ-TV and KUTV to become its new television home. Jazz owner Ryan Smith will start a new in-house production division, SEG Media, to produce the telecasts. While all games will air on KJZZ, Sinclair retains the right to carry select telecasts on KUTV, and KUTV will maintain an \"official station\" relationship with the team, allowing more coverage of the Jazz and its players. The deal will also include a streaming service, which will not involve KJZZ-TV. The Houston Rockets and the MLB's Houston Astros have continued to negotiate to take over AT&T SportsNet Southwest.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n \n \n List of NBA on ABC commentators\n List of NBA on ESPN broadcasters\n List of NBA on TNT commentators\n NBA on television in the 1950s\n NBA on television in the 1960s\n NBA on television in the 1970s\n NBA on television in the 1990s\n NBA on television in the 2000s\n NBA on television in the 2010s\n\nABC Sports\nESPN\nTurner Sports\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020s in American television", "unikey": "NBA on television in the 2020s", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["2019–2020", "2020–2021", "2021–2022", "2022–2023", "2023–2024", "References", "See_also"], "contents": ["### National\nThis was the fourth year of the current nine-year contracts withABC,ESPN,TNTandNBA TV.\n### Local\nUnder an agreement with theU.S. Department of JusticeregardingDisney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, theFox Sports Regional Networkswere required to be sold off to third parties by June 18, 2019.Fox also invoked a clause to giveYankee Global Enterprisesthe rights to buy their stake back in theYES Network, which aired the local broadcasts to the NBA's Brooklyn Nets.Including YES, the Fox Sports Regional Networks held the local TV rights to a combined total of 44 NHL, NBA, and MLB teams.On March 8, YES was sold to a consortium including Yankee Global Enterprises,Amazon, andSinclair Broadcast Groupfor $3.5 billion.Then on May 3, Sinclair andEntertainment Studiosagreed to purchase the rest of the Fox Sports Regional Networks.The networks continued to temporarily use the Fox Sports name under a transitional license agreement while Sinclair explored re-branding options.\n", "### National\nThis is the fifth year of the current nine-year contracts withABC,ESPN,TNT, andNBA TV.\nTo reduce on-site staff, ESPN and TNT will leverage the home team's rightsholder as a host broadcaster for some of their games.

mavericks and new orleans pelicans taking center stage an allfemale ensemble that will produce the broadcast its the second straight year espn has orchestrated an nba game led by an allfemale broadcast crew with this version being held on international womens day beth mowins and doris burke will call the action with more than 70 women taking part in wednesdays pregame and game coverage theyll fill the roles of analyst commentators producers directors graphic designers statisticians and social media operators really though it feels almost like any other day at the office for malika andrews because i see these women literally every day andrews host of nba today said in a phone interview on the amount of women contributing to the production you can hear and see their collective voices in this unique way so its like oh all of my favorite people get to work on this one project its going to be awesome in addition to mowins and burke calling the game cassidy hubbarth will serve as a sideline reporter there will be a pregame panel too consisting of wnba standoutcommentator chiney ogwumike reporter ramona shelburne and wnba coach of the year becky hammon with analyst monica mcnutt joining in as well andrews will host nba today and nba countdown from espns production center in los angeles in the second game of the doubleheader  when the los angeles clippers host the toronto raptors  reporter ros goldonwude will play a key role on the broadcast team as a society were moving forward and listening better and uplifting women in a more meaningful way but we still have progress to make andrews said we still have not had a woman who is a head coach in the nba im hopeful that those strides are going to happen in my lifetime the women i work around inspire me and what i see in the world the conversations that were having inspire me same sentiment for sara gaiero the coordinating producer who will oversee game production representation matters if you see it you can be it gaiero said to walk into a production truck control room media room and broadcast booth and see women in all of the chairs is a powerful sight there was a time when youd be the only woman in these rooms now we have so many talented women making regular contributions to our nba property and across our productions they follow in the nba footsteps of pioneering female sports commentatorsanalysts iconic names who covered the league such as cheryl miller the usc star turned analyst or ann meyers drysdale the ucla standout who is a tv analyst for the phoenix suns as well as the mercury theyre all paving the way for the next generation as much as this is a story that i hope makes little girls smile i hope they also look up and say theyre there because theyve earned it to be there i can earn it to be there too andrews said meyers drysdale doesnt look at this endeavor as breaking through any sort of glass ceiling shes not really a fan of that particular description its too restrictive i grew up in a generation where the sky was the limit said meyers drysdale whose broadcast career has also included covering the summer olympics certainly there have been obstacles and adversity but my parents were always like hey you can do anything you want meyers drysdale tries to follow the work of females in broadcasting around the league women like katy winge a reporterhostanalyst for the denver nuggets tv network altitude sports or lisa byington the playbyplay voice of the milwaukee bucks or kayte christensen a commentator for the broadcast of the sacramento kings or candace parker a twotime wnba mvp who was an analyst at the nba allstar game its wonderful to see because theyve got a voice and theres confidence in who they are and the opportunity that theyve been given meyers drysdale explained im just so proud of their presentation and their work ethic and their confidence and ability to do what theyre doing theyre all very

amid diamond sports bankruptcy proceedings by daniel kaplanmay 10 2023a federal bankruptcy judge voided for now the phoenix suns announced media deal with gray tv ruling it violated the rights of the incumbent regional sports channel under the bankruptcy code diamond sports parent of bally sports southwest is in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings heres what you need to know on april 28 the suns announced an agreement between the franchise local tv company gray and streamer kiswe that deal is voided according to bankruptcy judge christopher lopezs ruling which he read from the bench while bally sports southwest had no games left to telecast under its contract with the suns it did have a right of first refusal to match any possible new agreement the suns committed to diamond and the suns must negotiate over whether the bankrupt regional sports company has the right to match a replacement deal and judge lopez ordered that process to occur quickly given the suns have argued that uncertainty over where their games are carried could impair their financial prospects next season how did we get hereunder the bankruptcy code a debtors assets  in this case the suns rsn agreement with diamond  are frozen in place or stayed until a plan of reorganization judge lopez ruled despite the suns argument that all they did was strike a preliminary media agreement it violated the automatic stayadvertisementwhat i find is that the suns are saying one thing outside of this court and another thing inside it lopez said after a nearly fivehour hearing with the first two hours consumed by ultimately fruitless settlement talks between the partiesin court the suns and gray argued their deal was conditional on reaching a resolution on the right of first refusal but lopez noted that such language was not included in the first communications the suns sent to diamond on april 19 and only after diamond protested in a series of letters did the basketball team add a line to the april 28 press release announcing the media deal that the arrangement was conditioned on the incumbent regional sports channels approvaltheres no real response to diamonds april 25 or april 27 letters instead the suns go on an allout media blitz about the new agreement lauding its benefits he saiddiamonds lawyer brian hermann of paul weiss using the term insidious argued essentially the suns tried to slip one by diamond with the april 19 notification of the media agreement because the correspondence did not include a concession that bally sports sw had a right of first refusal it had five days from notification to execute its right of first refusal rights it was a line of argument judge lopez agreed withthis is undisputed the suns sent diamond arizona a letter informing them about what we will call an offer from gray and kiswe lopez said i would note and i state it on the record that the document attached  doesnt say that the agreement is subject to any rights for diamond arizona under the existing agreement that language we know now was intentionally omittedthe suns argued in papers this week that they had not breached the diamond contract and in any event the rsn company would have little chance at matching because the new graykiswe deal would expand the teams possible viewership from 800000 under bally sports to 24 million but in arguments tuesday hermann said the rights fee paid by the suns to diamond is higher than the amount agreed to with gray and the right of first refusal allows bally sports to match a lesser offer the suns countered that the extra exposure with being on free tv will allow the team to charge more for sponsorshipsadvertisementwhats nextwhatever the case the parties diamond and the suns must enter a dispute resolution process to adjudicate their differences over whether the incumbent rsn can match the voided graykisme deal if the suns were to win that ruling it could revive the nowshuttered media dealjudge lopez did deny diamonds motion to assess damages against the suns though he reserved the right to revisit he also ruled gray and kiswe had not violated the bankruptcy codesuns and mercury ceo josh bartelstein said in a statement later wednesday that the teams are excited to continue giving our fans the best possible experience and making our games accessible to everyone he added that they are committed to working
