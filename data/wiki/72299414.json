{"id": 72299414, "key": "Colorado Springs nightclub shooting", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado%20Springs%20nightclub%20shooting", "text": "On November 19–20, 2022, an anti-LGBT-motivated mass shooting occurred at Club Q, a gay bar in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. Five people were murdered, and 25 others were injured, 19 of them by gunfire. The shooter, 22-year-old Anderson Lee Aldrich, was also injured while being restrained, and was taken to a local hospital. Aldrich was charged and remanded in custody. On June 26, 2023, Aldrich pled guilty in the shooting and was sentenced to five consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole, plus 2,211 years.\n\nBackground\nClub Q is located at the 3430 block of North Academy Boulevard and opened in 2002. It was for a time the only LGBT club in Colorado Springs, Colorado's second-most populous city with a population of just under 500,000. A 2021 article by Denver-based magazine 5280 noted the club to be a place \"where LGBTQ folks [went] for drag performances, dance parties, and drinks.\" The shooting occurred on the eve of the Transgender Day of Remembrance.\n\nSince 2019, Colorado has had a red flag law that allows citizens or law enforcement to petition a court to order the removal of firearms from a potentially dangerous person.  Of the 19 states and the District of Columbia with red flag laws, Colorado has among the lowest per capita rates of invocation of the law. In opposition to the Colorado statute, more than half of the state's 64 counties declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries, including El Paso County where the shooting occurred. According to the Los Angeles Blade, \"It is El Paso County Sheriff's Office's explicit policy not to petition for an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) or Temporary Risk Protection Order (TRPO) to remove firearms from at-risk people\".\n\nShooting\nAccording to the police chief, the shooting began when Anderson Lee Aldrich entered Club Q while a dance party was being held. Wielding an AR-15 style rifle, carrying multiple magazines of ammunition, and wearing body armor, Aldrich immediately began firing at employees and patrons while moving further into the building. Many survivors at first mistook the gunfire for being a part of the music, until the shots continued and occupants saw the muzzle flashes. Multiple people sheltered behind the bar and in dressing rooms, while others stayed low to the ground.\n\nMinutes into the shooting, a club patron, identified as U.S. Army veteran Richard M. Fierro, charged across the room and tackled Aldrich to the ground, causing the rifle to fall out of reach. Fierro then grabbed a handgun from the shooter's hand and used it to hit the shooter repeatedly in the head. Fierro was assisted by two other patrons he recruited, including Thomas James, who moved the rifle away to safety, and a trans woman who used her high heels to stomp on the shooter, and who helped disable and hold the shooter down until the authorities arrived. Fierro estimated the shooter's weight at .\n\nPolice received an initial call for service regarding the shooting at 11:56 p.m. on November 19, with the first officer being dispatched a minute later. A total of thirty-nine patrol officers from all four divisions of the Colorado Springs Police Department, along with thirty-four firefighters and eleven ambulances, responded to the scene. The suspect was in custody within about five minutes after the first 9-1-1 call. After the shooting stopped, many were at first reluctant to leave from hiding spots as they were unsure if the shooter was reloading or had been stopped. Fierro, who had been covered in blood, was placed in police custody in a squad car for over an hour before he was cleared of suspicion and released.\n\nThe injured were transported to three hospitals: seven to Penrose Hospital, ten to Memorial Hospital Central, and two to Memorial Hospital North. Some ambulances, with most of them AMR, had to transport up to three patients at a time, and a few police cruisers had to transport victims as well.\n\nVictims \n\nFive people were killed, and twenty-five others were injured in the shooting, of whom nineteen were by gunfire. One of the deceased victims, Daniel Aston, was bar supervisor and a frequent performer at the nightclub. Another fatality, Raymond Vance, was the boyfriend of Fierro's daughter.\n\nDuring the press conference, the chief of the Colorado Springs Police Department made a point to say the department respected all community members and that they would be identifying the deceased by the names they and their loved ones used. He then read the names of the deceased victims and included their pronouns.\n\nAftermath \nA vigil was held on November 20 with standing room only at the All Souls Unitarian Church, which was also attended by several members of the City Council. Additional memorials and events were held throughout the week, which promoted spaces for people to gather and donate. Donation drives were set up shortly after the shooting from both local organizations and GoFundMe fundraisers for the victims and their families.\n\nOn November 24, Colorado Springs evangelical ministry Focus on the Family was targeted with a graffiti message, reading: \"Their blood is on your hands. Five lives taken.\"\n\nPerpetrator\nThe shooter was identified as Anderson Lee Aldrich, a 22-year-old resident of Colorado Springs. Aldrich was born Nicholas Franklin Brink on May 20, 2000, in San Diego, California, to Aaron Brink, a former pornographic film actor and mixed martial arts fighter, and Laura Voepel, the daughter of Randy Voepel, an outgoing member of the California State Assembly and a former mayor of Santee, California. Voepel and Brink separated and divorced one year after Aldrich's birth; while Voepel went on to receive custody over Aldrich, her tumultuous life – which included multiple arrests and mental health evaluations – resulted in Aldrich being cared for by Voepel's mother and stepfather, who eventually became Aldrich's legal guardians.\n\nAldrich grew up in northern San Antonio, Texas, and is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though according to the church, they had not been involved in church services for at least a decade. Records indicate that Aldrich was a target of online bullying that involved homophobic taunts while in middle school. Aldrich changed names on April 28, 2016, shortly before turning 16, citing a desire to remove associations with Aaron Brink, who by that point had multiple criminal convictions.\n\nAldrich's attorneys have said in court documents that their client identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, preferring to be addressed as Mx. Aldrich. Neighbors allege Aldrich to have made hateful comments towards the LGBT community in the past, including frequent usage of homophobic slurs. Aldrich never mentioned being non-binary prior to the shooting and was referred to with masculine pronouns by family members. Police testified they found rainbow-colored shooting targets in Aldrich's home. Experts in online extremism have voiced the possibility that Aldrich's proclaimed self-identification could be disingenuous; while the Center for Countering Digital Hate has advised using they/them pronouns for Aldrich, and also acknowledges the suspect's past actions and impact on the LGBT community.\n\nPrior incidents\nOn June 18, 2021, Aldrich's maternal grandparents revealed their plans to relocate to Florida. Angered at the development, Aldrich complained about losing access to the material stored in the basement which was intended for \"conduct[ing] a mass shooting and bombing\". Aldrich held the grandparents hostage, and threatened to murder them. Eventually, Aldrich let them go, shifted to Voepel's house, and holed up there. During an hour-long standoff with Colorado SWAT, an armed Aldrich live-streamed from inside and threatened to blow up the house. Neighboring homes had to be evacuated. Upon surrendering, a tub filled with explosive grade material — including ammonium nitrate and tannerite — was recovered alongside handguns, ballistic vests, and gas masks; Aldrich was jailed and charged with multiple counts of kidnapping and felony menacing. Aldrich entered a not guilty plea and was released on bail, a fortnight later. The case made negligible progress with Voepel and the grandparents refusing to accept any subpoena, under technical grounds, to avoid testifying against Aldrich. In July 2022, the case was dismissed, and records were sealed a month later.\n\nTwice before the 2021 incident Aldrich had been reported to Colorado Police for \"escalating homicidal behavior.\" On June 17, 2021, Aldrich's grand-aunt contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report Aldrich was planning to kill Christians and government employees, after Aldrich's grandfather had reported being threatened by Aldrich; however, the family did not press charges with local police. There is no record that law enforcement authorities or Aldrich's relatives attempted to trigger the Colorado red flag law, which might have allowed for the seizure of any weapons and ammunition that Aldrich possessed.\n\nAldrich and Laura Voepel had conflicts with passengers and crew during a July 2022 flight from California to Colorado. They were accused of harassing others while aboard the plane, and insulting some with racial slurs. After deplaning, Aldrich was filmed saying to another passenger: \"I wish I can shoot all of you\" and \"You keep following me and I'm going to fuck you up.\"\n\nSocial media activity \nAldrich had allegedly created a \"free speech\" website that hosted violent and racist content — including a video that advocated killing civilians to \"cleanse society\" — as of the night of the shooting. A second site, that was identified as a \"brother website\" on its homepage, had hosted footage of the 2022 Buffalo shooting and, on the night of the Club Q shooting, came to display four other videos, including one which apparently showed Aldrich's face reflected in a vehicle's rear view mirror. Testimony from a February 2023 hearing implied that Aldrich had operated a neo-Nazi website prior to the shooting.\n\nLegal proceedings \nAfter the shooting, Aldrich was charged with ten felony counts: five counts of murder, and five counts of committing a bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury. An El Paso County judge authorized the sealing of Aldrich's prior arrest records, saying the public release of the documents could \"jeopardize the ongoing investigation.\" Aldrich was represented by a public defender.\n\nOn December 6, Aldrich was charged with 305 criminal counts, which included first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, assault of the first and second degree, and hate crimes. District Attorney Michael Allen said it was \"probably the most charges that we’ve ever filed in a single case, on a murder case like this in the state of Colorado\". On December 8, a judge ordered the unsealing of court documents pertaining to Aldrich's June 2021 arrest.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, Aldrich was charged with new felony offenses for attempted murder and hate crimes. The additional twelve charges raised the total number of criminal counts to 317.\n\nOn June 26, Aldrich pleaded guilty for the shooting and was sentenced to five consecutive terms of life in prison.\n\nResponses\nThe shooting was condemned by certain politicians in the immediate aftermath. President Joe Biden said, \"While no motive in this attack is yet clear, we know that the LGBTI+ community has been subjected to horrific hate violence in recent years.\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that anti-LGBT political discourse is partially to blame for the shooting. The El Paso County government said \"We are deeply saddened by the senseless shooting that occurred early this morning in Colorado Springs at Club Q\" and sent condolences to support victim's families.\n\nColorado's red flag law and its application were scrutinized by advocates of gun violence prevention, politicians, and others. Governor Jared Polis, the nation's first openly gay governor, said \"We are eternally grateful for the brave individuals who blocked the [shooter] likely saving lives in the process\" and called for an examination of the application of Colorado's red flag law by Colorado's sheriffs. Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers said law enforcement should take advantage of the law under appropriate circumstances, while cautioning against jumping to conclusions about the application of the law to this shooting. Colorado state representative Tom Sullivan, whose son was killed in the 2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting and sponsor of the state's red flag law said the prior incident should have alerted the community. Jeffrey Swanson, a professor at Duke University School of Medicine who studies red flag laws, said Colorado's law could have been invoked.\n\nLGBT groups have widely memorialized the victims, and linked the mass shooting to recent rhetoric. Club Q said on social media that it was \"devastated by the senseless attack on our community\" and that it offered condolences to the victims and their families. The co-owners of Club Q attributed the shooting to a different kind of anti-LGBT hatred, inflamed by some Republican politicians and right-wing influencers and rooted in the demonization of drag queens as \"groomers\". Democrats have also been criticized by some for historically not doing enough to counteract anti-trans narratives, and generally being reluctant to proactively defend the transgender community.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement condemning the shooting. The statement read, in part, \"The senseless act of violence in Colorado Springs is of great sadness and concern to us. We are greatly troubled by any violence in our communities and condemn most especially violent acts that are the result of intolerance ...\"\n\nIn their responses to the shooting, several far-right pundits have promoted an LGBT grooming conspiracy theory, as well as perpetuating moral panic. Conservative media personality Tucker Carlson displayed a banner on his Fox News program Tucker Carlson Tonight that read \"Stop Sexualizing Kids\" while later hosting a guest who said that mass shootings would keep happening \"until we end this evil agenda that is attacking children\". YouTube commentator Tim Pool responded by criticizing the venue's drag show performances, saying, \"We shouldn't tolerate pedophiles grooming kids. Club Q had a grooming event\"; while right-wing commentators Matt Walsh, Candace Owens, Chaya Raichik, and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene all continued to publish content targeting LGBT people, some of which focused specifically on the Colorado area.\n\nAfter issuing a statement in which she offered her prayers to those affected by the shooting and called for the lawless violence to end, Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) was accused of hypocrisy based on her history of anti-LGBT rhetoric. Her past comments have included false grooming narratives and the litter boxes in schools hoax. She has been criticized for blocking gun control laws.\n\nJenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, was criticized for saying that the five people killed during the shooting were \"now reaping the consequences of ... eternal damnation\" because she claimed that there was \"no evidence\" the victims were Christian.\n\nFar-right provocateurs, including Jack Posobiec, questioned Richard Fierro's presence at the drag show, while others on the far-right called Fierro a \"groomer\" and a \"faggot\" simply because he and his family were at Club Q. Analysis published by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue has estimated that online usage of the terms 'pedophile' and 'groomer' increased sharply in the days following the shooting, as part of far-right and neo-Nazi celebration of, and apologia for, the massacre. The Department of Homeland Security also reported in a bulletin published on November 30 that online extremists praised the actions of the shooter. A significant rise in homophobic and transphobic posts following the shooting has been tracked by LGBT advocates both in far-right forums such as Gab and in more mainstream social media such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\n\nOn December 14, 2022, several survivors of the mass shooting presented their testimony to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform. The witnesses placed blame for the attack on hateful rhetoric, calling it the direct cause of the massacre, and also warned of the dangers of hate speech, saying that it is damaging even in the absence of explicit calls for violence. At the hearing, Club Q owner Matthew Haynes pushed back at Republican politicians, saying \"I know that we, our Club Q community, are in the thoughts and prayers of so many of you. Unfortunately these thoughts and prayers alone are not saving lives. They're not changing the rhetoric of hate.\" Haynes also read aloud examples from some of the hundreds of the hateful messages received following the shooting, including one that said \"the shooter was doing God's work\". Survivor James Slaugh said that LGBT issues should not be politicized, and urged respect for basic human rights: \"Outside of these spaces, we are continually being dehumanized, marginalized and targeted. The fear-based and hateful rhetoric surrounding the LGBT community, especially around trans individuals and drag performers, leads to violence.\"\n\nSee also\n\nList of mass shootings in the United States in 2022\nList of shootings in Colorado\nUpStairs Lounge arson attack \nOrlando nightclub shooting  \n2022 Bratislava shooting\n2022 Oslo shooting\nTel Aviv gay centre shooting\nViolence against LGBT people\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2022 in Colorado\n2022 in LGBT history\n2022 mass shootings in the United States\n2022 murders in the United States\n2020s anti-LGBT movement in the United States\n2020s crimes in Colorado\nNightclub shooting\n21st-century mass murder in the United States\nAnti-drag sentiment\nAlt-right terrorism\nAttacks on bars\nAttacks on buildings and structures in 2022\nAttacks on buildings and structures in Colorado\nAttacks on nightclubs\nDeaths by firearm in Colorado\nHate crimes\nLGBT in Colorado\nLGBT-related controversies in the United States\nMass murder in 2022\nMass murder in Colorado\nMass murder in the United States\nMass shootings in Colorado\nMass shootings in the United States\nNeo-fascist terrorist incidents in the United States\nNeo-Nazism in the United States\nNovember 2022 crimes in the United States\nTerrorist incidents in Colorado\nTerrorist incidents in the United States in 2022\nTransgender history in the United States\nViolence against LGBT people in the United States\nViolence against gay men in the United States\nViolence against trans men\nViolence against trans women\nMass shootings involving AR-15–style rifles\nHomophobia\nTransphobia in the United States", "unikey": "Colorado Springs nightclub shooting", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Shooting", "Victims", "Aftermath", "Perpetrator", "Legal_proceedings", "Responses", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Club Q is located at the 3430 block of North Academy Boulevard and opened in 2002.

said thursday anderson lee aldrich is accused of fatally shooting five people and wounding 17 others at the gay nightclub in colorado springs last month prosecutors charged aldrich who uses theythem pronouns with 305 criminal counts on tuesday and on thursday colorado authorities and newly unsealed court documents confirmed it wasnt the first time the 22yearold has faced criminal charges a court dismissed five felony charges against aldrich four months before the club q shooting in june 2021 aldrich was arrested on allegations of making a bomb threat that led to a lengthy standoff with swat teams according to an affidavit unsealed thursday by a judge aldrichs grandparents told police that aldrich had held them hostage in their own home at times chugging vodka pointing a weapon at their heads and sharing plans to be the next mass killer aldrich was charged with five felonies including firstdegree kidnapping the case was prosecuted in colorado but the states strict public records laws had kept the documents sealed and prevented state officials from publicly acknowledging their existence that didnt stop local and national media outlets from reporting on the case in the immediate aftermath of the club q shooting but incomplete and misleading narratives prompted colorado district attorney michael allen to hold a news conference on thursday defending his offices handling of the case national colorado lgbtq club shooting suspect is charged with hate crimes any chance of conviction dissolved when it appeared that aldrichs grandparents and mother were unwilling to testify allen said a subpoena service failed to connect with the witnesses the only people who couldve delivered testimony on the bomb threat without violating hearsay laws timing also played a role after two trial delays at the prosecutions request the judge granted the defenses motion to dismiss in july 2022 three weeks ahead of the sixmonth deadline for completing a speedy trial under colorado law no one gave up on this case we were fighting until the very end allen said the only way that it would have prevented the tragedy is if the witnesses actually were present at trial testified and somebody was convicted he added aldrich allegedly told their family they would be the next mass killer enlarge this image mourners hold a candlelight vigil outside the state capitol in denver on nov 23 to honor

was living in fear after aldrich said they were collecting ammunition firearms and bulletproof armor in order to become the next mass shooter according to arrest records on june 18 2021 pullen called a family meeting to discuss a plan to move to florida aldrich upset by the idea allegedly began loading bullets into the magazine of a glock handgun and aiming it at their grandparents saying you guys die today aldrich later carried a box of chemicals into the room claiming it was a homemade bomb after their grandparents fled by car aldrich drove to their mothers house a swat team eventually surrounded the property negotiating with aldrich they had a gas mask armor piercing rounds and were ready to go to the end but eventually surrendered to police the arrest records say in an august 2021 hearing to lower aldrichs initial 1 million bond their mother and grandparents described them to the judge as loving unusually bright and someone who would take advantage of another chance national club q owner in colorado says he will reopen the lgbtq club after mass shooting aldrich was released a few days later on a 100000 bond with conditions they live with their mother kristy bootes an independent victims advocate that spoke at the district attorneys news conference said it was very common for witnesses to recant their statements or decline to testify against family members theres many reasons why a crime victim may recant but in my experience the most common reasons are love fear and guilt she explained though the reason that aldrichs family didnt testify is still unclear an order to restrict aldrichs access to weapons expired when the case was dismissed reporters peppered allen with questions about why the incident hadnt triggered colorados red flag laws which are designed to prevent individuals deemed at risk of violence from purchasing or possessing a firearm investigators seized two weapons from aldrich at the time of the bomb threat  a socalled ghost gun with a glock frame and no serial number as well as an assault rifle aldrich unsuccessfully petitioned to retrieve the guns from the el paso county sheriffs office following their release other court documents released thursday included a letter from two siblings of aldrichs grandfather which claims aldrich had been making guns on a 3d printer colorado springs police chief adrian vasquez told nprs morning edition last month that the shooter at club q carried an arstyle platform long gun along with multiple magazines with ammunition but authorities have not provided any updates on how and when the weapons were obtained aldrichs felony charges in the bomb threat case triggered a mandatory protection order which has the same effect as red flag laws it remained in effect the 383 days the case was pending but ended in july 2022 with the cases dismissal under colorado law family members or law enforcement can request an emergency risk protection order that allows the seizure of weapons from someone deemed a reasonable threat but the erpo only takes effect for 14 days law why colorados red flag law didnt stop the colorado springs shooting after the 14 days expire a court can grant an extension lasting up to 364 days but allen said the district attorneys office lacks the power to make such a request under state statute one agency that does have the power to request an erpo is the el paso county sheriffs office which investigated the 2021 incident but in a statement released thursday the office said aldrich didnt need an erpo because it had already seized all known weapons in aldrichs possession and the evidence to justify an erpo was rendered unusable when the case was dismissed and sealed the legal ability aldrich had to acquire firearms following the dismissal of the previous case and the can only be addressed legislatively reads the statement it most certainly is not a situation with which to indict the el paso county sheriffs office for wrongdoing or inaction in this case in preliminary hearings for the club q case aldrichs attorneys have repeatedly called for documents to be sealed to protect the defendants rights for a fair trial in the face of intense

bay times via ap grooming has become the most recent scare tactic of choice for the right fox news host laura ingraham included a segment on her show last month where she claimed public schools have become grooming centers where sexual brainwashing takes place congresswoman marjorie taylor greene recently tweeted that the democrats are the party of grooming and transitioning children last week one america news host chanel rion even called president joe biden the groomerinchief what kind of people would oppose grooming laws jack posobiec ããâãâªââããâ jackposobiec april 6 2022 for the unfamiliar grooming is a term typically reserved to describe the type of behavior that child sexual abusers use to coerce potential victims without being caught but now some republicans are using it against any democrat or company1 who disagrees with them on certain policy issues this is a deliberate tactic that was promoted as early as last summer by christopher rufo the same conservative activist who helped muddle the language around critical race theory grooming is a term that neatly draws together both modern conspiracy theories and old homophobic stereotypes while comfortably shielding itself under the guise of protecting children who after all can argue against the safety of kids but by adopting this language to bolster their latest political pursuits the right is both giving a nod to fringe conspiracy theorists and using an ageold tactic to dismantle lgbtq rights there is no better moral panic than a moral panic centered on potential harm to children said emily johnson a history professor at ball state university who specializes in us histories of gender and sexuality this most recent round of highprofile grooming warnings seems to have started in early march as democrats attacked floridas law limiting what can be taught in schools republican defenders turned to grooming as a way to push back the bill that liberals inaccurately call dont say gay would be more accurately described as an antigrooming bill christina pushaw florida gov ron desantiss press secretary tweeted on march 4 if youre against the antigrooming bill you are probably a groomer or at least you dont denounce the grooming of 48 year old children except theres no mention of grooming in the law instead it prohibits classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity in kindergarten through third grade or in a manner that is not ageappropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards so if casting those who oppose this law as progrooming is not rooted in evidence what is it rooted in in part its a dog whistle to the partys most extreme conspiracyminded base the foundation of the qanon conspiracy theory is that there is a mass secret underground ring of satanic pedophiles whose members consist of democratic leaders and hollywood elites painting anyone who opposes floridas law ie mainly democrats as being progrooming fits neatly into that narrative and winks at qanon adherents without requiring politicians on the right to actually endorse the outlandish theory recommended politics the second gop debate could be smaller with or without trump read now recommended the second gop debate could be smaller with or without trump what americans think of the

the washington post via getty imagesnov 22 2022 947 pm utcby katelyn burns msnbc columnistthe irony of losing queer people to violence on the night before our community gathers to remember those we lost to violence is a bitter pill to swallow but on saturday a shooting at a colorado springs lgbtq club killed five people and injured 19 the shooter was tackled by patrons at the bar before any others could be added to the list of names read out this weekendthe next logical step for the antitrans and antilgbtq movement was always moving into deadly violence the antilgbtq violence we saw this weekend has been inevitable for a while now as conservative politicians have increasingly ramped up violent rhetoric against lgbtq people and particularly trans peopleover the last year or so the language directed at drag shows and trans people has hit newly dangerous levels in farright circles the word groomer has become a synonym for an lgbtq person drag queen story hour events in which drag queens dramatically read books to children while wearing spangly outfits have become a common gathering spot for rightwing groups to protest sometimes showing up with gunsin the last six months a number of childrens hospitals that care for trans patients have received dozens of bomb and death threats a new york city bar that hosts drag shows has been repeatedly vandalized while police appear to look away and lgbtq gathering spots elsewhere in the country have seen their windows broken and have also received death threatsthe next logical step for the antitrans and antilgbtq movement was always moving into deadly violence weve seen this before with the antiabortion movement which started out by politically opposing a specific form of health care moved to inperson mass protests then vandalism and finally mass violence directed at abortion providersi wrote about the correlation between the escalating historical violence of the antiabortion movement and the ongoing climb in violence against lgbtq people by the antitrans movement here a few months ago in august i published a piece for medium about how i was expecting someone to get killed as a result of the proliferation of extreme antitrans rhetoric and i hate that i was right just a few months laterthat the violence was completely foreseeable if inevitable and no one in power bothered to find a way to stem the moral panic against trans and queer lives is a damning indictment of our political and media environments the conservative social media account libs of tiktok took to social media sunday the day after the shooting to point its massive audience at a different colorado drag show if anything the mainstream media and todays political campaigning about trans people helped ramp up the rhetoric the conservative social media account libs of tiktok took to social media sunday the day after the shooting to point its massive audience at a different colorado drag showthose who consistently call out the escalating rhetoric are typically written off as wokescolds but it turns out the wokescolds are the most aware of the social dynamics at play here and easily foresaw where all of the violent language was headed the shooting in colorado wasnt an isolated incidentbut what we really need is for the adults in the room to come to grips with their own discomfort with the idea of trans people even when theyre kids being trans is not a controversy theres no trans question theres just trans people and how the rest of the world reacts to the existence of trans peoplethe violence will continue until we all decide that the antilgbtq rhetoric needs to stop until then we should expect to continue seeing a string of violent acts against trans people lgbtq gathering spots and childrens hospitals just as weve seen decades of murder against abortion providersid love to sit here and say enough is enough now the violence must stop but i know thats not how this works too many people care more about hating trans people rather than keeping people alive and thats just the world we live inin a perfect world there would be congressional investigations into antilgbtq and gun violence and executive branch law enforcement action to perhaps prevent another shooting but we dont live in that world trans and queer people we need to protect ourselves let us take the example of those bar

evangelized more and talked about more polis said during an interview on colorado matters i think that while it has been used a couple hundred times i think that not everybody knows that its on the books we also have very disparate records of utilizing it from different county sheriffs  i think everybody should look at their practices and say hey if theres somebody that we feel is dangerous that theres not enough to you know take them in and hold them on a criminal charge can we at least remove access to their weapons there is a way to do that under colorado law and i want to make sure people are aware of that and know that anderson lee aldrich 22 was identified by authorities on sunday as the person allegedly responsible for the club q shooting in colorado springs tips for coping with gun violence and grief resources and how to help last year a man by the same name and agewas reportedly booked in the el paso county jailafter threatening his mother with homemade bombs multiple weapons and ammunition according to a news release by the el paso county sheriffs office at that time however theres no public record that prosecutors moved forward with felony kidnapping and menacing charges against aldrich or that police or relatives tried to trigger colorados red flag law that would have allowed authorities to seize the weapons and ammo the mans mother says he had with him in the interview with ryan warner polis pointed out that while some jurisdictions have applied the law others have been hesitant to do so el paso county sheriff bill eldertold reporters in 2020that he had concerns about the law and his agency didnt plan on filing any applications but that he would enforce a court order if someone else like a family member applied for an order polis deferred when asked if he regarded the shooting as an act of terrorism well look no matter what you call it its a horrific tragedy and you know i think we dont really know the motives yet we dont know if this was a planned attack on the lbgtq community we dont know if it was simply an act of a deranged individual we will find out the suspect is apprehended people always want to find meaning right were still trying to find meaning in the king soopers shooting we never get all the answers we want because at the end of the day theres no rational explanation for this kind of horrific event after being diagnosed with covid last week polis said hes still quarantining until at least midweek on sunday he participated virtually during a memorial service at unitarian universalist church in colorado springs and added that he talked with a clubgoer who was at club q polis who attended a happy hour event at the venue last year said he also spoke with the clubs owners matthew haynes and nic grzecka i did tell them when i spoke to them yesterday morning that when they reopen i would be happy to be on hand and join them to celebrate the resilience that we will come out of this but now its really a

enforcement documents verified by the associated press brought swat teams and the bomb squad to a normally quiet colorado springs neighborhood forced the grandparents to flee for their lives and prompted the evacuation of 10 nearby homes to escape a possible bomb blast it culminated in a standoff that the then21yearold livestreamed on facebook showing aldrich in tactical gear inside the mothers home and threatening officers outside  if they breach im a fing blow it to holy hell  before finally surrendering criminal defense lawyers with whom ap shared the law enforcement documents say they questioned why charges were not pursued in the 2021 incident given the grandparents detailed statements a tense standoff at the mothers home and a subsequent house search that found bombmaking materials that aldrich claimed had enough firepower to blow up an entire police department and a federal building the documents were obtained by colorado springs tv station kktv and verified as authentic to ap by a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the sealed case and kept anonymous documents also included a judges order to jail aldrich on 1 million bond and a listing by district attorney michael allen of seven offenses committed or triable including three felony counts of kidnapping and two of menacing for his part allen has repeatedly declined to comment on why those charges didnt go forward citing a colorado law that automatically seals records in cases when charges are dropped and requires him to not even acknowledge the records exist the law was passed three years ago as part of a nationwide movement to help prevent people from having their lives ruined if cases are dismissed and never prosecuted and even though allen said during a news conference soon after the nightclub shooting that he hoped at some point in the near future to share more about the 2021 incident he has yet to do so ap and other news organizations have gone to court seeking to unseal the entire case file a request scheduled to be heard later this weekin the absence of that file there are only scattered clues about what happened after aldrichs 2021 arrest including aldrich telling the gazette of colorado springs in august about spending two months in jail as a result of the incident and asking the publication to remove or update its web coverage about it asserting the case had been dismissed there is absolutely nothing there the case was dropped aldrich said in a phone message adding it is damaging to my reputation were not going to be taking personal property away from people without due process elder said as the law neared passage in 2019 allen the district attorney also criticized the red flag law while running for the office in 2020 tweeting that it is a poor excuse to take peoples guns and is not designed in any way to address real concrete mental health concerns he has noted since the shooting that das dont have the authority

shooter needs to be investigated authorities have refused to say how the weapons used in the attack were obtainedthere were many warning signs polis spokesman conor cahill told the ap it appears obvious that an extreme risk protection order law could have and should have been utilized which would have removed the suspects firearms and could very well have prevented this tragedyaldrich now 22

what we know about the suspect in the colorado springs lgbtq nightclub shooting while aldrich remains hospitalized questions have emerged about a previous encounter with law enforcement  and whether anything could have been done to help prevent the bloodshed in june 2021 aldrich was arrested in connection with a bomb threat that led to a standoff at his mothers home according to his mothers former landlord and a news release from the local el paso county sheriffs office two law enforcement sources confirmed the suspect in the nightclub shooting and the bomb threat were the same person based on the name and date of birth in the 2021 incident sheriffs deputies responded to a report by the mans mother that he was threatening to cause harm to her with a homemade bomb multiple weapons and ammunition according to the release deputies called the suspect but he refused to comply with orders to surrender the release said leading them to evacuate nearby homes chet strangegetty images

since columbine in 1999 colorado continues to be scarred by mass shootings the two law enforcement sources who said the suspect purchased the firearms also told cnn his arrest over a bomb threat would not have shown up in background checks because the case was never adjudicated the charges were dropped and the records were sealed it is not clear what led to the sealing of the records they said red flag laws in colorado in 2019 colorado passed a controversial red flag law that allows family members a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporality seize a persons firearms if they are deemed a risk when asked why the red flag law wasnt used in aldrichs case colorado attorney general phil weiser said it was too early to make any decisions about the case i dont have enough information to know exactly what the officers knew he said what we can do is make sure that we embrace this as a call to action to better educate about this law to make sure that law enforcement understands it and is able to use it to protect lives colorado springs mayor john suthers cautioned against people assuming the circumstances of aldrichs case should have led authorities to invoke the red flag law hopefully there will be a time when there can be a specific discussion about any prior interaction with law enforcement and i think those circumstances would cause one to be able to make commentary about potential application of the red flag law but i think its premature to do so now he said cnns raja razek phil mattingly rosa flores rosalina nieves jennifer marnowski evan perez chris

rejected for most of their lives parks told cnn in a world that can be so dark and so angry its that one place that feels like home were able to unwind forget about our troubles with work family society because of club q were able to make friends that turn into family and be accepted for our true selves the lgbtqia community has undergone so much bigotry and hatred already to have our safe

celebrating her 18th birthday at the club and left just before shots rang out she said she remembers the scene on the dance floor as she was leaving dozens of people laughing singing and dancing looking at that dance floor is going to be a completely different feeling now that we know what happened to 30 people on that floor forsell told cnn i keep all of the drag queens in my heart they made

politics of red flag laws by emma tucker cnn 7 minute read updated 1144 am est mon november 28 2022 link copied matthew staver for the washington postgetty images cnn  the prior arrest of the 22yearold suspected gunman who allegedly opened fire in a colorado springs lgbtq nightclub last weekend has put the spotlight on a state law which can be utilized to temporarily remove gun access from those deemed a danger to themselves or others colorados controversial red flag law also known as an extreme risk protection order allows law enforcement family members or a roommate to petition a judge to temporarily seize a persons firearms if they are deemed a risk but one caveat is they must start the process if the public is uninformed of the potential risk or rejects gun control measures or law enforcement refuses to enforce the law it could be rendered useless some observers said the year before anderson lee aldrich whose attorneys say uses theythem pronouns allegedly entered club q with an arstyle weapon and a handgun killing five people and injuring at least 19 others they were arrested in june 2021 on two counts of felony menacing and three counts of firstdegree kidnapping according to a news release from the el paso county sheriffs office at the time aldrich allegedly threatened to harm their mother with a homemade bomb and other weapons but no charges were filed and the case has since been sealed it is unclear why the records were sealed anderson lee aldrich courtesy leslie bowman details are coming to light about the alleged gunman who killed five people at an lgbtq nightclub when asked last week why the red flag law was not used in aldrichs case colorado attorney general phil weiser said it was too early to say i dont have enough information to know exactly what the officers knew weiser said the sheriffs office did not respond to requests for comment but it does not appear that anyone including law enforcement triggered the process to obtain an extreme risk protection order after aldrich allegedly made the threat law enforcement sources told cnn the suspect purchased the two weapons brought to club q however police have not provided details about when the transaction took place aldrichs arrest in connection to the bomb threat would not have shown up in background checks according to the law enforcement sources it is unclear whether the states red flag law could have been used in aldrichs case or if ultimately it would have prevented the mass shooting last weekend following the 2021 arrest there was an indication aldrich was someone who posed a risk of harm jeffrey swanson a professor at duke universityschool of medicine who led the research group that published the first evaluations of red flag laws told cnn the law could have been used its a great sort of parable of how you can pass a law and if its not implemented or used its not going to do any good he continued red flag order valid for a year red flag laws can be useful in cases where an individual shows an inclination to harm themselves or others or have had encounters with police but charges were never pursued according to swanson its designed for cases where theres a clear indication of someone who poses an imminent risk to others or themselves but otherwise would be qualified to buy a gun he said the law allows for a type of restraining order which does not have any criminal penalties associated with it unless a person violates the order according to allison anderman senior counsel and director of local policy at the giffords law center to prevent gun violence sarah silbigergetty images house passes red flag bill as part of gun control push under the law a court can issue an order valid for up to a year restraining a person from accessing guns if the petitioner has met the standard of proof to demonstrate a credible and substantial risk said anderman who worked with colorado lawmakers as they were drafting the bill its minimally invasive yet it restrains a person from obtaining lethal weapons if theyre in a period of crisis anderman told cnn and when the laws are used they work extreme risk laws have been shown to reduce firearm suicide rates in connecticut by 14 and indiana by 75 according to the giffords law center data up to 2015 county is a second amendment sanctuary after the 2021 arrest aldrich was booked into the el paso county jail the same facility where they were transferred on tuesday after the club q shooting el paso county home to colorado springs has openly rejected the states red flag law the formal legal process to temporarily remove a persons firearms if they are deemed a risk to themselves or others under the states law which went into effect in 2020 has never been initiated by the el paso county sheriffs officeaccording to reporting by the colorado sun sgt jason garrett a spokesman for the sheriffs office told the sun wednesday the office has never requested an extreme risk protection order butdid not respondto a question askingwhy it has not been used according to the sun timothy a claryafpgetty images some sheriffs who condemned red flag laws are putting them to use el paso county sheriff bill elder who declined an interview request from the sun publicly denounced the law in 2019 tellingcnn affiliate koaathat it violates citizens constitutional rights were going to be taking personal property away from people without having due process elder told koaa were not going to pursue these on our own meaning the sheriffs office isnt going to run over and try to get a court order elder told koaa in 2019 however elder said if a judge issues an order then it is up to law enforcement to execute that order cnn has reached out to the el paso county sheriffs office for comment but did not receive a response in 2019 a year before the law came into effect the board of el paso county commissioners approved a resolution to designate the county a socalled second amendment sanctuary the county was among dozens in the state to make the declaration pledging to actively resist the bill arguing it violates second amendment rights its a highly suspect action from beginning to end said robert spitzer a professor in the political science department at suny cortland referring to the countys decision to declare itself a second amendment sanctuary but it raises the question of whether the police if they had information would be willing to take action on their own spitzer said the second amendment sanctuary movement prompted by the enactment of the red flag law in colorado really has nothing to do with actual law and a lot more to do with a statement of political defiance there is a very big question mark on whether the sanctuary declaration had a tangible effect on law enforcement in the county or not spitzer said but the implication certainly suggests that it could have he added lack of awareness impedes law one of the major reasons red flag laws are not enforced is because people are not aware of them or do not know what steps to take when someone shows signs of dangerous behavior its incumbent on the stakeholders officials in a state when a law is passed to have careful thought and some investment and thinking about how to implement this said swanson it involves educating the right people about it and law enforcement are key in his response to a question about red flag laws last week after the club q shooting colorado attorney general weiser said state officials are working hard to educate and to bring more awareness about the red flag law weve got to do better and were going to work on educating law enforcement to make sure that again for everyone who is responsible gun owner this red flag law is not about you this is about people who are dangerous who we know should not have firearms weiser added another barrier to the law can be police discretion according to spritzer the nature of policing relies on a great deal of discretion which allows officers to decide whether to give a speeding ticket for example or not to use an existing law because they dont support it it opens the door to perhaps not enforcing laws that could have a profound effect on peoples lives and safety spritzer said people who have an involuntary commitment history from years ago are banned from buying or possessing firearms even if they arent dangerous but those who are alienated display anger impulsivity or an inclination to harm others might not have a record that disqualifies them from buying a gun swanson said what do we know about people who have impulsive anger and possess a gun if you could think about that compared to the tiny group of people who are getting these risk protection orders theres a long way to go swanson said its just too small a pebble to make much of a ripple in such a big pond he added related ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback search log in my account settings topics you follow log out your

abusers shame on you said michael anderson who survived the shooting as leaders of our country it is your obligation to represent all of us not just the ones you happen to agree with hate speech turns into hate action and actions based on hate almost took my life from me at 25 years old survivor james slaugh gave emotional testimony describing getting shot and watching his loved ones bleed he also placed direct blame on lawmakers hateful rhetoric saying it was the direct cause of the club q massacre he also warned of the damage caused by hateful rhetoric that does not explicitly call for violence including rhetoric on which bathrooms lgbtq people can use and whether they can join certain sports teams hate rhetoric from politicians religious leaders and media outlets is at the root of the attacks like at club q and it needs to stop now rhetoric that seeks to silence what sports we can play what bathrooms we can use how we define our family and who i can marry slaugh saidthe hateful rhetoric you have heard from elected leaders is the direct cause of the horrific shooting at club q we need elected leaders to demonstrate language that reflects love and understanding not hate and fear in her opening remarks chairwoman carolyn maloney a democrat from new york said my heart breaks for those who endured this ruthless act of violence the club q shooting represents an attack on all sacred places for lgbtqi people across the country that offer the promise of community and refuge from rampant bigotry adding the attack on club q and the lgbtqi community is not an isolated incident but part of a broader trend of violence and intimidation across our country maloney told the survivors that their testimony will serve as a tremendous public service for their community and for our nation thank you let us honor them by recommitting to the bold action necessary to ensure that every person in the united states can experience to live authentically and safely regardless of who they love or how they identify tom williamscqroll call incgetty images ranking republican member james comer  who is expected to takeover the committee when republicans retake the majority next year  sharply pushed back on those remarks and defended republicans against claims they were contributing to any violence comer said his thoughts and prayers are with survivors victims and their families and said no one should have to experience what you all have experienced let me state clearly as we have consistently said republicans condemn violence in all forms unfortunately democrats are using committee time and resources today to blame republicans for this horrendous crime this is not an oversight hearing this is a blame republicans so we dont have to take responsibility for our own defund the police and soft on crime policies on this committee we should be using our time and resources to conduct oversight into the rise of violent crimes committed against all americans and organizations every day americans no matter what the what side of the aisle are living in a highcrime environment comer said when club q owner and survivor matthew haynes read his prepared remarks he seemed to push back directly at comer saying i know that we our club q community are in the thoughts and prayers of so many of you unfortunately these thoughts and prayers alone are not saving lives theyre not changing the rhetoric of hate we need safe places like club q more than ever and we need you our leaders to support and protect us haynes said before reading some of the hate messages he received celebrating the deaths of gay people haynes blasted republicans for voting against the respect for marriage act saying by doing so they were sending a message that it is ok to disrespect and not support our marriages we are being slaughtered and dehumanized across this country in communities you took oaths to protect haynes said directly toward lawmakers lgbtq issues are not political issues they are not lifestyles they are not beliefs they are not choices they are basic human rights and so i ask you today not simply what are you doing to safeguard lgbtq americans but rather what are you or other leaders doing to make america unsafe for lgbtq people he said president joe biden signed the respect for marriage act into law on tuesday after congress passed it last month the house vote

denying that george floyd was murdered by minneapolis police officer derek chauvin mocking the death of makhia bryant and taking pains to deny the existenceof systemic racism she has directed outrage towards schools offering racially inclusive curriculums originally raichik used her platform to single out lgbtq people and school teacherswith inclusive approaches to education manyof whomwould subsequently receive harassmentand death threats but her online schtick has evolved to encompass campaigns against school districts libraries and hospitals hospitals and medical workers across the countryhave been subject to harassment and even bomb threats after being targeted in posts from raichik and others including matt walsh in june members of the proud boys hate group attacked a drag queen story hour eventata san lorenzo california public library after raichik highlighted it alameda county sheriffs office investigators reportedly said that libs of tiktok had caused the attack later that month more proud boys tried to break into a bar that was scheduled to host a drag event after raichik alerted her followers to the event also in june hatewatch reportedthat raichik had posted about a pride event in coeur dalene idaho days before police thwarted an attempted disruption of the event by white nationalist hate group patriot front security experts have describedraichiks output as stochastic terrorism by which they mean that her hateful rhetoric is calculated to promote violence in some proportion of her followers her posts frequently contain false information raichik has presented fake curriculum materialsas if they were real and presented covert recordingsof uninformed responses from nonmedical hospital staff as if they represented treatment policies at the facility her habit of spreading hate and disinformation has seen raichik briefly suspendedfrom the platforms she is active on including twitter since elon musk acquired the platform however raichik has availed herself of the opportunity to purchase a blue check and has even engaged in ableist banterwith the new proprietor raichik tried hard to maintain her anonymity as the author of the hate account but the washington post unmasked herin april noting that raichiks content is amplified by highprofile media figures politicians and rightwing influencers raichik has been a guest on the joe rogan experience and her content has been promoted by farright media figures and influencers including tucker carlson glenn greenwald jesse watters laura ingraham and donald trump jr her tweets frequently form the basis of content pushed out by rightwing media  from items on carlsons fox news show to dozens of articles in socalled  pink slime junk news sites more disturbingly raichik and other antilgbtq influencers have shaped policy by encouraging divisive campaigning and mustering support for antilgbtq laws desantis dances to raichiks tune in march christine pushaw press secretary to florida governor ron desantis defended the states socalled dont say gay bill with antilgbtq smears accusing people of grooming children the bill which desantis signed into law later that month would prevent teachers from discussing gender and sexuality in any way with children in kindergarten through third grade critics have pointed out that the rule would prevent children with lgbtq parents from participating in ageappropriate activities like making family trees the bill also allows state intervention on any discussion of gender and sexuality in public schools through high school also in march pushaw credited raichiks account with having opened her eyes to conspiracyminded views on schools approaches to gender and sexuality in the classroom this was evident in scores of interactions between pushaw and raichik on the platform stretching back to june 2021 at the beginning of raichiks focus on antilgbtq campaigning floridas law is just one of many recent pieces of statelevel legislation across the us targeting lgbtq people and especially trans people five other stateshave passed laws that censor classroom discussion of gender and sexuality and four more require parents to be notified ahead of such discussions eighteen states meanwhile have passed laws banning trans women and girls from competing in k12 girls and womens sports some of these laws also ban their participation at the college level in arizona and arkansas genderaffirming care for trans youth is banned and in alabama providing such care is a felony crime other states including texas have attempted to pass similar laws the american academy of pediatrics laid out their best practicesfor genderaffirming care in 2018 highlighting in particular that such care improves mental health outcomes for trans youth especially in contrast to conversion models of intervention contrary to persistent disinformation from rightwing reactionaries such care never includes surgical or chemical castration as far back as 2016 many states attempted to pass socalled bathroom bills mandating that public restrooms in stateowned buildings could only be used by people according to the sex assigned on their birth certificates three states  alabama oklahoma and tennessee  still have such laws on their books missouri and south dakota meanwhile prohibit schools from adding lgbtqspecific provisions to schools nondiscrimination policies antilgbtq hate on the campaign trail in 2022 encouraged by political operatives like christopher rufo many republicans made antiwoke messages targeted at lgbtq people the centerpiece of their midterm campaigns in practice this meant an unprecedented volume of demonizing antitrans ads funded by wellheeled pacs like the american principles project a creature of farright billionaire richard uihlein antitrans political ads did not stop on election day on monday herschel walkers campaign released an ad whipping up fear about trans girls and women competing in sports according to their gender identity which referred to them as biological males walker has been delivering regular antitrans stump speeches during his effort to unseat sen raphael warnock in georgia where the candidates now face a runoff some commentators suggestedthat the gop has employed this strategy to mobilize white evangelical christian voters so that they would turn out in sufficient numbers to neutralize the backlash against the supreme courts dobbs decision which overturned 50 years of legal precedent safeguarding access to abortion rufo a gig harbor washington based farright propagandist and a fellow at the hardright manhattan institute was initially prominently involved with the conservative campaign to demonize critical race theory crt which the right used as a proxy for all forms of inclusive education in august rufo explained to the new york timesthat he had advocated for republicans to pivot from anticrt campaigning to attacking lgbtqinclusive curriculums he told the newspaperthe reservoir of sentiment on the sexuality issue is deeper and more explosive than the sentiment on the race issues days before that profile was published rufo appeared alongside desantisat the signing of the stop woke act which bans workplaces and schools from teaching that any person is privileged due to their race or sex and was the culmination of desantiss multifaceted public fightwith the disney corporation many commentators  including some republicans  have attributed the gops failure to generate a red wave election to the malicious antilgbtq messaging rufo recommended based on the lukewarm outcome such rhetoric either did not resonate with or repelled voters around the country that rhetoric did pay off for desantis however who won almost 60 of the gubernatorial vote led his party to large majorities in both houses in the legislature and helped elect a slate of handpicked school board candidates who were also running on platforms that opposed inclusive curriculums his successes have seen desantis touted as a possible 2024 election candidate raising the prospect that the use of antilgbtq rhetoric and policy as political tactics will continue on the national stage antilgbtq hate in colorado in colorado meanwhile farright figures  including republican politicians  also actively spread smears conspiracy theories and falsehoods about lgbtq people in the months leading up to saturdays mass shooting not long after she was first elected to the house of representatives lauren boebert the farright republican congresswoman for colorados 3 rd district responded to the passage of the federal equality act with transphobic remarks claiming trans people would spy on young girls in school locker rooms boebert  who has embraced the qanon conspiracy theory hurled islamophobic slurs at a fellow congresswoman and amplified donald trumps false claims about a stolen 2020 election  narrowly won reelection this month colorado springs where the shooting took place has itself has long been a hub for the christian right which for decades has pumped out antilgbtq propaganda in the name of a narrow and exclusionary definition of family in the 1990s colorado springss focus on the family led the fundamentalist charge in support of amendment 2 a colorado ballot measure that banned municipalities from including lgbtq people in their antidiscrimination policies though the initiative passed in 1992 in 1995 the supreme court found that it violated the 14th amendment to the us constitution more recently evangelical churches have reportedly advocated for fundamentalist candidatesin school board elections but still manage to retain their nonprofit status despite prohibitions on electioneering the splcs hate map lists four antilgbtq hate groups in the state with two  the family research instituteand the pray in jesus name project headquartered in colorado springs the state also plays host to active chapters of other hate groups who have taken violent or disruptive actions against lgbtq people like the proud boys and patriot front since the nadir of amendment 2 colorado has evolvedto boast one of the most progressive policy slates for lgbtq rights in the country but more liberal laws have not made the state immune from the rightwing moral panic sweeping the country proud boys attempted to disruptdenver

at a starbucks in southwestern japan prosecutors urge rejection of excops bid to dismiss civil rights conviction in george floyd murder investigators also heard from an acquaintance that aldrich said their mother laura voepel is nonbinary and forced them to go to lgbtq clubs joines testified during the hearing which is expected to conclude thursdayhate crime charges require prosecutors to present evidence of a motive  that aldrich was driven by bias either wholly or in part the defense countered that aldrich was not antilgbtq but was high on multiple drugs was sleep deprived and came from an abusive family after being shot it is clear from the video that james was tiring but he continues to do what he can to subdue the suspect until police arrive gardner testified noting that james later gave up his spot in an ambulance to someone else who was injured army veteran richard fierro rushed over to help grabbing the rifle and throwing it gardner said fierro then used the handgun to beat

livestreaming the attack a hat found in aldrichs vehicle had a phone taped to it and aldrich recorded four videos using a livestreaming app starting over an approximately twohour period before the shooting she said after the gunfire ended and police arrived aldrich tried to blame the shooting on one of the patrons who subdued them while also claiming that the shooter was hiding officer connor wallick testified officers didnt believe it and shortly afterward confirmed that aldrich was the shooter he saidpolice found several highcapacity magazines at the scene including a drumstyle one that holds 60 rounds and was empty and others that hold 40 rounds gasper said a state law passed after the 2012 aurora colorado theater shooting bans magazines of more than 15 roundsalthough aldrich identifies as nonbinary someone who is a member of a protected group such as the lgbtq community can still be charged with a hate crime for targeting peers hate crime laws are focused on the victims not the perpetrator at aldrichs apartment investigators found gunmaking materials receipts for weapons and a drawing of the club in aldrichs mothers room they found round gun range targets with holes in them gasper said voepel had taken aldrich to the range it was also revealed that the rifle and the handgun used in the attack appeared to be ghost guns or firearms without serial numbers that are homemade and do not require an owner to pass a background check one part of the handgun did have a serial number but the overall weapon was likely not purchased whole and appeared to be privately made

lost in the shootingvigils in coloradowhere to find resources and how to help as condolences from across the country flowed in for victims of the club q shooting in colorado springs some were sternly rejected by members of the queer community both rep lauren boebert and former gubernatorial candidate heidi ganahl posted on twitter that they would pray for everyone affected by sundays mass shooting lgbtq people and allies promptly called out the two republicans for transphobic and homophobic remarks they made while in office and on the campaign trail while it is still not clear what motivated the alleged shooter the attack comes during a tense time among lgbtq communities the basic validity of transgender identity was heavily debated during the 2022 election where transphobic campaign ads were sent to mailboxes and broadcast on television and radio stations sponsor message i would say im definitely nervous burlie gooch who identifies as pansexual said at the memorial outside club q i need to be careful and watch my surroundings but its not gonna stop me from wanting to live despite their messages of support in the shootings aftermath experts and advocacy organizations say fear tactics and laws promoted by boebert ganahl and other public figures have led to harassment and violence aimed at queer communities they are the reason why these folks are so emboldened to harm our community and they need to do some searching on the inside as to why they think its okay to stand on the back of others for their own political success nadine bridges executive director of lgbtq advocacy nonprofit one colorado said during a tuesday morning interview boebert told koa a commercial radio station in denver that it was disgusting to try to blame the attack on her she then doubledowned on the exact type of rhetoric bridges and other advocates have criticized what ive criticized is the sexualization of our children and ive criticized men dressing up as caricatures of women and taking what is rightfully a womans whether that be a position in the workforce whether that is an award or a trophy or a medal that a girl has worked her entire life to practice  then a mediocre male athlete comes in and completely dominates her and takes what was rightfully hers she said bridges said shes seen a lot of antiqueer vitriol targeted at schools and their administrators schools have become a battleground for lgbtq advocates and their opponents i have attended many school board meetings where there has been just vile vitriol towards the community bridges said  attending public comment for state board of education meetings where we hear some of the same hate speech towards the transgender nonbinary and gender expansive community members while campaigning this year both boebert and ganahl made claims that furries a subculture of people who create alter egos in the form of animal characters are present in colorados schools boebert went as far as saying some school officials had put litter boxes in bathrooms to accommodate students its kids identifying as cats and its actually a real thing its just the trend happening in high schools and middle schools where they dont talk theyre mutes ganahl told cpr news in september the unsubstantiated claims may have helped fuel a viral tiktok trend that saw students place litter boxes in bathrooms themselves as a prank some parents latched onto ganahls claim complaining to schools and districts who have denied there is a widespread problem involving furries experts and advocates say the claims are a form of veiled homophobia recent discussions around identity and queerness have also impacted public school curricula conservative school board members at the state and local levels have argued that proposed social studies standards which mandate the inclusion of minorities and other marginalized groups including lgbtq communities is child indoctrination a committee that reported to the state board of education initially opted to remove requirements that teachers reference lgbtq issues in classes below the fourth grade the problem with the lgbtq issues are not inclusion or exclusion but whether the discussion of sex in its various forms is appropriate for kindergartners board vicechair steve durham said in april other board members pushed back saying including perspectives from disadvantaged groups isnt sexual in nature the board eventually voted along party lines to approve changes to the curriculum but the final draft restored references to marginalized groups including lgbtq perspectives to all grade levels it will go into effect next year related mesa county school board president under fire for social media posts on gender ari drennen who tracks misinformation about queer communities for media matters said parents are easily targeted and swayed by disinformation campaigns that appeal to their protective nature people are being radicalized by these groups forming on facebook like moms for liberty and some other groups like that who are running for school board theyre going to school board meetings theyre coming in with these antilgbtq conspiracy theories and the idea that theyre there to stop people from basically turning gay drennen said advocates warn that antilgbtq laws normalize the dehumanization of queer people lgbtq advocacy groups and government watchdogs have been tracking bills across the us from federal and state governments that have the potential to affect lgbtq rights while most bills attempting to limit lgbtq rights at the state or federal level fail some have become law weve seen bans put into place on the ability of trans minors to access genderaffirming care weve seen bans passed in multiple states that exclude trans people from athletic competition weve seen laws like that dont say gay bill in florida that really curtail the free speech of lgbtq people in the classroom drennen said colorado lawmakers have largely avoided introducing those sorts of bills any attempt would likely be blocked by the democratic majority and a group of moderate republicans in the state legislature the national push to pass the equality act a bill aiming to amend the civil rights act of 1964 so that it prohibits discrimination based on sex sexual orientation and gender identity may bear fruit after passing through the house last year colorados congressional delegation was split when the bill came up for a vote republicans doug lamborn and ken buck voted against the bill while rep boebert urged others to follow her lead and not vote at all where is the equity in this legislation for the young girls across america who will have to look behind their backs as they change in school locker rooms just to make sure there isnt a confused man trying to catch a peek boebert asked on the house floor the bill is awaiting a hearing in front of the senate judiciary committee bridges said codifying laws that restrict the rights of lgbtq people could further dehumanize the community this is no longer just locker room talk right this is no longer about your transphobic homophobic family members or neighbors who are making jokes this is harming our community its creating trauma and violence this type of language is violence towards our community bridges said the alleged shooter in sundays attack was arrested on charges of five counts of firstdegree murder and five counts of biasmotivated crimes causing bodily injury  and was booked into the el paso county jail tuesday afternoon editors note boebert not

the same apartment hallwaykraus 23 who said he once considered aldrich a friend also told the daily beast that the 22yearold suspect in the mass shooting at the lgbtq club club q that killed five people and injured 18 more on saturday frequently used the word fggotaldrich has since been charged with five counts of murder and five hate crimes in connection with the latest episode of mass gun violence in america to target the lgbtq communitythere would be times where he and his mom would get into fights arguments because he would be saying hateful things about whoever he was angry with kraus told the daily beast he said things sometimes that probably should have been alarming to me he used the term fggot a lot most of the time it came from a place of anger kraus said he called aldrich andy but understood his neighbors full name to be anderson lee aldrich because kraus would sometimes pick up orders of medicine for him and his mother whom he identified as laura voepelattempts to reach voepel for comment on this story were not immediately successful colorado springs police did not immediately respond to a request for comment a spokesperson for the local prosecutors office deferred a request for comment to a pending press conference it was not clear if aldrich had an attorney last year as has been widely reported the el paso county sheriffs office responded to a bomb threat involving 21yearold anderson lee aldrich and his mother who told police her son was threatening her with a homemade bomb multiple weapons and ammunition after evacuating the area police took aldrich into custody without further incident though videos obtained by the daily beast suggest he was wearing tactical gear and itching for some kind of violent confrontationlocal prosecutors have not yet explained what happened in the aftermath of that episode which saw aldrich booked on kidnapping charges among others authorities have also not confirmed that the aldrich arrested in connection with the club shooting is the same individual as the suspect in that episodekraus told the daily beast that police knocked on his door at 3 am this past sunday hours after the attack and asked about the apartment in which aldrich had lived kraus didnt learn details of the shooting until later sunday and assumed police meant the new neighbor who moved in a month ago he saidit was only when he heard aldrichs name in connection with the shooting that he came to believe it was the same man he knew he saidwe had this conversation talking about how dangerous these guns are these weapons are said kraus he had this idea that we would go out at some point to a range and he teach me some gun safety and go out and shoot some target practice we never ended up getting around to do that but that conversation just kind of sits with me because i know how i felt when i saw the gun and he showed it to me he was like this is all legal im totally allowed to have this it was an assaultrifle type gunaldrich liked to go to a range that allowed rapid fire shooting and would do so with his mother kraus said showing the daily beast videos of a man and woman he identified as aldrich and his mother firing at a targetthe date on which the videos were recorded was not clearthere was one time where he made a shooting his gun reference to a woman he was upset with kraus said and this was one of the instances where his mom was like andy oh my god no you cant say thatanother chilling episode that kraus said stuck with him at one point aldrich asked if hed like to hold

at club q in colorado springs a makeshift memorial grows outside the lgbtq club on monday nov 28 2022 a judge denied a request friday to delay a preliminary hearing for the suspected club q shooter the public defenders office had asked for more time to go over what they described as a voluminous and overwhelming amount of evidence in the case  including video footage of the entire shooting according to prosecutors that includes 5000 pages of documents and more than a terabyte of digital files including 911 calls surveillance video and witness interviews from the nov 19 shooting defense attorney joseph archambault said his team would not be able to review even a small tiny fraction of the evidence shared by the district attorneys office due to upcoming trials in other cases and the short amount of time between hearings we will not be able to be constitutionally effective at that date he said referencing the preliminary hearing scheduled for feb 22 2023 judge michael mchenry emphatically denied the request suggesting new counsel might be more effective if current representation was unable to get through the records youre going to be here and youre going to hear every word the witnesses in this case have to say mchenry said and you will have the opportunity to crossexamine them the purpose of a preliminary hearing is to determine whether enough evidence exists to bind a defendant over for trial fourth judicial district attorney michael allen agreed to share a list of witnesses with the defense more than two weeks prior to the scheduled hearing as well as a list of exhibits they plan to formally introduce in court mchenry also accepted a motion by the prosecution to file additional charges in the case this week pushing the number to 317 total counts including firstdegree murder attempted murder and hate crimes allen said the new charges come from the identification of two more victims who survived the attack anderson alrdrich was incourt for the hearing it

rump were killed in the attack at club q  some while working a saturday night shift and others while enjoying the nights events at least 19 others were injured most by gunshots police have said aldrich entered the nightclub just before midnight armed with an arstyle weapon and a handgun and immediately began shooting police said from the amount of shots that initially went off when he came into the club i honestly thought it was multiple people shooting clubgoer gil rodriguez told cnn on monday the suspect was quickly taken down and contained by two patrons until police arrived which officials say likely prevented more people from being killed or injured richard fierro an army veteran who was celebrating a birthday at the club with family and friends tackled aldrich to the ground and used the suspects handgun to hit them repeatedly fierro told cnn another person jumped in to help and pushed the rifle out of aldrichs reach fierro said a police officer lifts barricade tape while

options allen said he expects more charges on top of those colorado has biasedmotivated crime statutes which most people understand as hate crimes we are definitely looking at that based on the facts involved in this case allen said and if theres evidence to charge it well absolutely charge those as well additional charges of menacing are also possible colorado attorney general phil weiser said every single person who was there at club q is a victim of one crime or another weiser told cnn on tuesday its really important that were able to honor the victims and to be able to call out this crime for what it really appears to be which is a hate crime motivated by who people were he added new details emerge about the suspect as authorities try to nail down a motive behind the shooting new information has come to light about the suspects upbringing and questions have been raised about why previous charges against aldrich were dropped aldrich was born under the name nicholas brink and legally changed the name in 2015 anderson lee aldrich courtesy leslie bowman details are coming to light about the alleged gunman who killed five people at an lgbtq nightclub that same year aldrich experienced cyberbullying on a parody website that contains photos of aldrich and uses offensive slurs to mock the thenteens weight and accuse aldrich of engaging in illegal activity according to an emerging portrait of the alleged shooter pieced together by cnn the page which was first reported by the washington post is still active xavier kraus a neighbor of the accused shooter said he and his girlfriend lived across the hall from aldrich and their mother until september kraus said they mostly played video games together often in aldrichs apartment aldrich would occasionally express hateful attitudes toward people kraus recalled kraus said he specifically remembered one time aldrich vocalized verbally that they did not like or slash hated the gays using a derogatory term for them he added that many other outbursts were racial aldrich was not someone i would have around my gay friends kraus said he said the alleged shooter never mentioned they were nonbinary aldrich was proud of the weapons they owned according to kraus when aldrich showed him a weapon one time kraus told them guns like this scare me kraus recalled aldrich telling him bro its not the guns its the people that you gotta be scared of and that conversation kinda sits with me aldrichs mother told police her son threatened her with a bomb according to a relative the suspects primary caretaker was his grandmother who declined cnns request for an interview aldrich ended up under her supervision when their mother struggled with a string of arrests and related mental health evaluations according to court records and an interview with a family member laura voepel aldrichs mother called police last year and reported aldrich had entered the colorado springs house she was renting a room in and threatened her with a homemade bomb video ad feedback 2021 video appears to show colorado club shooting suspect ranting about police 0152  source cnn video obtained by cnn showed aldrich apparently ranting about the police during the incident and challenging them to breach the home ive got the fking shtheads outside look at that theyve got a bead on me aldrich says on the video pointing the camera at a window with blinds covering it you see that right there fking shtheads got their fking rifles out later in the video aldrich says if they breach imma fking blow it to holy hell the video ends with aldrich delivering what seems like a message to law enforcement outside so uh go ahead and come on in boys lets fking see it the video does not actually show any officers outside the house and its not clear from the video whether aldrich had any weapons in the house several hours after the initial police call the local sheriff departments crisis negotiations unit was able to get aldrich to leave the house authorities did not find any explosives in the home the el paso county sheriffs office said police chief adrian vasquez gives an update about the club q shooting investigation monday at the police operations center in colorado springs colorado scott olsongetty images aldrich was arrested and booked into the el paso county jail on two counts of felony menacing and three

district attorneys office said no formal charges were pursued in the case the district attorneys office did not respond to a request for comment from cnn aldrich purchased the two weapons brought saturday night to club q law enforcement sources told cnn this week but its not clear whether the arstyle rifle and handgun were purchased before or after the 2021 case aldrichs arrest in connection to the bomb threat would not have shown up in background checks because the case was never adjudicated the charges were dropped and the records were sealed its unclear what prompted the sealing of the records were a city in mourning mayor says with the shooting happening just days before thanksgiving some families that were planning holiday gatherings are now reeling from the impact of the violence

hide caption toggle caption corey perrineflorida timesunionusa today network via reuters co corey perrineflorida timesunionusa today network via reuters co mallory mcmorrow was stunned when she saw it with horror the michigan state senator a democrat read an email accusing her of grooming children the email was sent by a fellow senator republican lana theis who was soliciting funds from her supporters for her reelection campaign in that email theis wrote that children are under assault in our schools by what she called progressive mobs trying to steal our childrens innocence and then it got personal she accused me by name of grooming and wanting to sexualize kindergartners mcmorrow tells npr i mean my heart absolutely sank mcmorrow says she kept thinking about her 1yearold daughter noa what is grooming you know grooming is the act of befriending a child for the purpose of molesting them she says just the most horrific disgusting vile accusation that can be thrown at you lately that accusation has been thrown at those who support lgbtq rights teachers companies politicians  in addition to mcmorrow grooming has become an incendiary buzzword of rightwing rhetoric weaponized in the fight over antilgbtq legislation actual grooming occurs when adults take advantage of a childs vulnerability to manipulate and coerce the child into sexual abuse now that meaning has been warped and corrupted to broadly smear the motives of lgbtq people and those who oppose antilgbtq legislation a few recent examples on his fox news program tucker carlson claimed that california teachers are trying to indoctrinate schoolchildren about sexual and gender identity theyre grooming 7yearolds and talking to 7yearolds about their sex lives he said on her fox news show laura ingraham accused the walt disney co of pushing a sexual agenda on children this isnt programming this is propaganda for grooming she said and us senate candidate jd vance of ohio defended the term on fox news saying if you dont want to be called a groomer dont try to sexualize 6 7yearold children youtube i am the biggest threat to your hollow hateful scheme she said in a direct address to theis her voice filled with outrage because you cant claim that you are targeting marginalized kids in the name of  quote  parental rights if another parent is standing up to say no in that speech mcmorrow made a point of saying twice i am a straight white christian married suburban mom and she concluded with this thought i know that hate will only win if people like me stand by and let it happen reflecting on that speech now mcmorrow hopes her words will counterbalance some of the hurtful rhetoric lgbtq people are bombarded with i talked to kids in my district at a high school last monday she says and the first question was from a girl probably 15 or 16 who said you know i identify as queer im lgbtq why do they hate us and its just heartbreaking mcmorrow said she told the student i promise you there are a lot of us like me who dont education teachers fear the chilling effect of floridas socalled dont say gay law technology tiktok bans misgendering deadnaming from its content the grooming accusation has a long history that feeds off fear the grooming accusation hurled at mcmorrow among many others has a long history accusing lgbtq people of grooming or recruiting children to become gay or transgender is an ageold trope that feeds off fear the grooming smear often expands to include accusations of pedophilia and sex trafficking  conspiracy theories spawned by farright extremists such as qanon supporters propagated widely through social media and rightwing channels and spreading through mainstream conservative thought its a despicable attack but its not a new tactic says lgbtq rights activist evan wolfson this is a classic trope of dehumanization and fear that has been used against gay people decade after decade after decade  think about the calumny against gay people throughout most of our lifetimes that gay people somehow are molesting kids or after kids or predatory that idea propelled antigay activist and singer anita bryants save our children campaign in the 1970s and it led to a 1978 california ballot measure to ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools an initiative spearheaded by state sen john briggs who promised we are going to restore morality to the classroom and remove openly and blatant homosexuals from influencing and teaching our young the ballot measure failed but the homophobic attacks continued fueling a moral panic this is only round 1 said california state sen john briggs to the press about the defeat of proposition 6 on nov 7 1978 proposition 6 called the briggs initiative sought to ban gays and lesbians from working in california public schools doug pizacap hide caption toggle caption doug pizacap wolfson heard those attacks all through the fight he led to legalize samesex marriage now he says theres an added layer of transphobia the trans conversation is relatively newer wolfson says and therefore more susceptible to confusion to distraction and to primal fear which is what pushing the button about kids is intended to do fears stoked about lgbtq people have surfaced in focus groups and polling conducted by the movement advancement project a nonprofit think tank that researches public attitudes on lgbtq issues what the far right often does is they engage peoples reptilian brains the fightorflight instinct says the organizations executive director ineke mushovic and so it behooves farright conservatives to put people in a state of fear because then theyre reactive they dont support change the grooming narrative mushovic says taps into this primal sense of fear and this kind of parental protective instinct but we know its a completely false narrative promoting a grooming narrative the grooming narrative has been actively promoted by conservative activist christopher rufo who has also led the charge against teaching critical race theory now he has turned his attention to what he calls gender ideology this year he asked for help from his twitter followers im looking for documents pdfs audiovideo and training materials related to gender grooming and trans ideology in schools he tweeted youtube but five years ago he would have supported that bill thatcher says because i didnt know i had no frame of reference for people who literally feel like they have to justify their right to exist but i get it now and because i get it i cant unget it thatcher says he gets it now because of his work with lgbtq people on suicide prevention his position on these issues resulted in an attack from a rightwing activist group in utah that accused him in an email to its supporters of promoting grooming of children for gender nonconformity in our public schools thatcher calls the explicit email the nastiest thing ive ever seen grooming is an act that happens as you break down barriers of someone he says its especially heinous when pointed at unsuspecting trusting vulnerable children and so the argument that telling a child that you will support them regardless of who and how they love is somehow equivalent to teaching a child that theyre not allowed to say no or set boundaries  like to me that is just reprehensible to conflate the two shots  health news rachel levine calls state antilgbtq bills disturbing and dangerous to trans youth efforts to restrict rights for lgbtq youth floridas governor signs controversial law opponents dubbed dont say gay efforts to restrict rights for lgbtq youth nearly half of lgbtq youth seriously considered suicide survey finds thatcher warns that his partys emphasis on passing antilgbtq legislation such as bans on genderaffirming care or trans sports bans will backfire the path that the gop is on right now is not sustainable he says if somebody tried to campaign today on ending gay marriage they would get so little traction outside the most fringe elements and yet even five years ago that wasnt an extreme position  i think its only a matter of time i think this is a stupid stupid argument to be making because every day more and more people know someone who is gay or transgender for his part alabama state rep neil rafferty the only openly gay member of his states legislature remains optimistic even in the face of alabama passing some of the countrys harshest antilgbtq laws people say well alabamas gonna alabama  rafferty says but i have no choice but to remain hopeful because if i dont have hope that it can get better if i dont have hope that we can change it if i dont have hope that we can push back and push back effectively and meaningfully then what the hell am i even doing here national its hurtful trans youth speaks out as alabama debates banning medical treatment youtube youtube when we showed gay people he says when we elevated the voices of gay people as part of the conversation  and i say this as someone who is gay  we wanted to show the gay people as part of a family the gay people as part of a workplace the gay people in this case as part of a classroom and i think the same lesson applies here too the slogan love is love was the lesson learned in the freedom to marry campaign grooming lgbtq facebook flipboard email read  listen home news culture music podcasts  shows

varying experience of grief on nov 19 2022 five people at club q in colorado springs died in a mass shooting renewing debate about the gunviolence epidemic and domestic terrorism but there was another dimension to this shooting club q is a wellestablished and beloved lgbtq club in the colorado springs area many members of the lgbtq community have been left feeling scarred fearful and violated and with a lack of protections in place for this community some wonder how lgbtq students on campus process the event and find helpful resources and safe spaces though the question has no simple definitive answer kristie soares assistant professor of women and gender studies and codirector of the cu boulder lgbtq certificate program hopes to start an open conversation on the campus about lgbtq violence and provide students with support networks in a time of great pain most importantly there is no correct way to feel after club q you should feel you have space to cry scream and get angry soares added emotions cant be processed in a right or wrong way soares focuses their work in queer latinx media and queer of color critique specifically media representations its interesting to examine not only negative stereotypes in media but also how unintentional representation can become something radical like when a character is written as cisgendered but becomes a queer character within the fanbase of a piece of media soares said the lgbtq studies certificate program is interdisciplinary meaning that students can take classes outside of the department to meet requirements which opens up a wide range of courses and topics to study as long as the course has more than 50 lgbtq content we approve that for the certificate this includes classes with a large independent project component if you choose to do a project about lgbtq issues soares said the program is approaching its 30year anniversary in 2025 but soares said interest in the certificate has spiked in recent years were in a really exciting and scary time for queer and trans people and in some ways these very negative issues have reinvigorated peoples interest in studying the lgbtq community and taking that with them into government and publicpolicy jobs soares said soares is working on a manuscript titled playful protest the political work of joy in latinx media and is passionate about the ways that joy can be a response to severe trauma and statesanctioned violence in marginalized communities theres something very queer about joy soares said we have a strong history of queer and trans people connecting joy to politicsstonewall was an uprising but it was also a bar where people were dancing and enjoying themselves the stonewall uprisings were a series of protests in greenwich village manhattan in response to police crackdowns on gay and lesbian bars reflecting on the reactions to the club q murders on campus soares said joy and fear naturally go hand in hand and there is room for all emotions recognize that this is a violation and we dont currently have the protections that we need to guarantee that this wont happen againit is not unreasonable to be out in lgbtq spaces and be scared soares emphasizes that there is no one correct way to grieve in these moments there are normative systems put in place related to grieving that just dont fit for marginalized communitieswhen trauma is not the exception anymore that grieving process is going to be more constant despite this reality there are many ways on campus to find safe spaces to feel emotions and talk to one another soares said she believes community spaces are the key to this such spaces can be nightclubs but also knitting circles book clubs or text chains the great thing about these spaces is the joy that comes with themits ok to laugh at something funny on a text chain or watch silly movies even though we are in a world in some ways defined by homophobia transphobia and the trauma that comes with itthats a part of the experience of being queer and trans soares said queer asterisk a group of queer mental health professionals in boulder is a great place to start when accessing resources she said the group offers free digital support groups to process emotions and build connections and can connect students with free therapy on campus students can find an array of resources and communities we have the pride office which is a student services focused center and the academically focused certificate program these are all great options for returning students students new to boulder and students who may not have spent a lot of time on campus due to the pandemic and are still searching for their community here soares said we also have clubs like the gay student alliance and queer people of color both great places to make friends and find the joy that is so important in these times clubs and centers will individually host events and there is also a transforming gender conference on march 1819 which will draw people from around the country and include discussions and workshops faculty gathered last year to do a panel discussion on their experiences as transnonbinary folk in higher education soares said thats the great thing about the cu communitythere is faculty you can reach out to who are working on these issues but also identify as part of the community this can be really helpful too soares adds grief is an ongoing process one without a straightforward path when our daytoday safe spaces are violated that can be devastating in those moments it is even more important to find community soares said you do not need to go through this or any other traumatic events alone a full list of resources can be found on the lgbtq resource website related articles cu
