steven hydencultural critictwitterjuly 11 2022 like many people this summer i recently powered through the first season of the bear a gritty and intense fx dramedy currently streaming on hulu about a family restaurant in chicago thats taken over by troubled hotshot chef carmy jeremy allen white after his older brother michael jon bernthal takes his own life a surprise breakout hit the bear has been rightfully lauded for its many attributes  the excellent ensemble cast the insightful and emotionally deft writing the authentic depiction of workingclass chicago and the way the filmmaking creates unbearable no pun intended tension inside the fraught kitchen workplace but what initially drew me to the show was the soundtrack which struck me as refreshing and even subversive for being resolutely  unhip if you watch enough prestige tv  and youre the sort of person who pays attention to the music playing in the background  you no doubt understand what these shows are supposed to sound like they almost always cater to the sensibilities of the elite upperclass viewers who are drawn to these programs the song mix is usually the same some recordcrate soul from the 60s an obscure country or soft rock tune from the 70s maybe a dash of krautrock or 80s indie perhaps an ironic nod to an overplayed radio hit and then a roundup of new music favorites beamed in from a spotify algorithm this is all great music but these soundtracks often treat songs like signifiers of quality they are so aggressively tasteful and curatorapproved that they can feel a little anonymous and even oppressive like youre watching the televisual equivalent of a blandly fashionable downtown boutique but the bear moves to a radically different rhythm the bulk of the soundtrack is made up of songs from the 80s and 90s that patrons of the shows fictional eatery the original beef of chicagoland might like pearl jam john cougar mellencamp counting crows genesis radiohead if thats not dad rock enough for you there are also three wilco songs while some snobs might wince at such a normie playlist the music enhances the everyman vibe of the bear while also feeling true to the characters and the milieu so many tv shows and movies bungle their soundtracks by turning the protagonists into inauthentic music experts whose listening habits dont line up with real life whereas in the bear when carmys lunkhead cousin richie ebon mossbachrach retreats to his car during a tough day at the restaurant it makes perfect sense that he would have a live acoustic version of counting crows have you seen me lately playing on the stereo its also to be clear an awesome song the men responsible for the soundtrack are two of the main creative minds behind the bear christopher storer the shows creatorcoshowrunnerexecutive producerwriterdirector and executive producer josh senior we became the music supervisors out of just desperation storer explains we were like lets save some money and just do it ourselves but its obvious that this decision goes well beyond just navigating around a tight budget storer and senior have real passion for the musical aspect of the bear when i reached out with questions about a dozen or so tracks that appeared in the eightepisode season they were giddy at the prospect of talking about the many personal favorites that ended up in the show at one point i asked if they deliberately went against the grain in terms of not picking a conventionally cool soundtrack for this kind of buzzy prestige show a hundred percent senior concurred more often than not that stuff takes me out there was a period of time where it was super cool to hear orchestral covers of pop songs what a novelty and it worked really well and i think there are music supervisors who are really good at that but for us music is part of the world of the show and it almost would feel disingenuous to be dropping songs that we couldnt relate to or that didnt feel like they lived in this world and only because they were popular for a different reason here is a playlist of songs from the first season of the bear with storer and seniors commentary about why they were selected

be a comedy dont think so loud and pointless storyline was mildly disappointing entertainment perhaps this will improve over time but not holding my breath long show less show more paul e 23h ago the bear is actually one of the many shows where ive looked at it thought it wouldnt be that great then actually binge watch it within a day i dont know if its the raw emotion throughout this series but something about this show had me hooked on the start now that ive finished the first two seasons im so eager to watch the third season and hopefully many more seasons show less show more k 2d ago i wasnt sure about this show as im not a fan of comedy im so glad i decide to watch it tho 2 season of this gem is not enough i hate and love show like this  love because i the characters are so real that i get ridiculously emotional attached the acting  the writing the chaos is so real that you forget is a show i love well directed show like this richi if you read this i love you tina i want to be like you syd you are so annoying where can i get my  let it rip every minute counts  yes jeff  gear show less show more b n 2d ago this show was so good to be honest i watched this season a long time ago but came here to write this review after watching the pos season 2 is this season drew you in made you care about what was happening you felt like you were there in the action season 2 was perhaps the biggest disappointment of any tv show ive seen walked into season 2 with such high expectations after such an incredible first run show less show more michael a 3d ago good stuff  great cast show less show more scott w 4d ago first season is absolutely amazing a great mental health type of tv show that takes a deeper dive into the horrors of cooking at restaurants intense show that many must see show less show more diego c 4d ago everything about this show is just awesome show less show more john w 6d ago omg this is a must watch tv series the bear throws you into issues in the 1st season and its like you are literally in the arguments with them its familiar its scary but its not until season 2 that you begin to understand where all the issues stem from come from they come from the narcissistic mother who badly infiltrates her children with emotional trauma the anxiety the ptsd complex trauma and so much more each character are excellent in their roles i love it and i am waiting for season 3 show less show more gloria p 6d ago season 1 was slow and extremely hard to pay attention to theres hardly any action and is just dark for most of it wasnt a fan show less show more gabby e jan 02 2024 this show is a masterpiece i was foaming at the mouth for season 2 haha every character became a beloved character in all their complexities and imperfections the pacing was unique from my experience and there was a harmony in the chaos that i appreciated so much show less show more sasha d see all audience reviews movie  tv guides view all golden tomato awards awards

so long its nice to see pop on the menu show less show more tracy a jan 02 2024 loved it in every way it did season 1 justice i did think that the romance between carmy and the old crush was a little forced but im hoping its just a natural not meant to be depiction i didnt find the actress was likable the chemistry just didnt deliver for me i dont know why her character was very sweet and i can see him with a sweetheart but eh cant put my finger on it overall amazing performance by everyone else show less show more sasha d jan 01 2024 i didnt think season 2 could be better than season 1 but it is show less show more dave r dec 27 2023 hang in for a few episodes to really get to know characters and you wont shut it off awesome show show less show more kelly f see all audience reviews

of years lately where we start these bestof lists talking about what a weird year for tv its been certainly this years lineup felt in some respects like the end of a chapter of the 20 favorite series

some bold and confident new vision that felt like nothing id ever imagined let alone seen as long as television is capable of doing that i dont think there can ever be any such a thing as a truly bad

thinly sliced beef sweet peppers a pickled vegetable relish called giardiniera all stuffed into an italian loaf and topped au jus the sandwich started with cheaper cuts the story of how the italian beef sandwich came to be one of chicagos signature foods begins with discrimination against italian immigrants in the early 20th century when those families would go to market they would be only be sold the cheaper cuts of meat like the roast or the ends of the cow which are less tender says chicago historian shermann dilla thomas view this post on instagram a post shared by fx networks fxnetworks but three steps helped transform a tough cut of meat into a prime sandwich to feed big families the families found they could tenderize the meat by cooking it for a long time like over the course of a workday thomas says they also masked the quality of the meat with fresh bread and they sliced the meat very thin to help stretch the supply the sandwiches were frequent guests at weddings where families would gather at a banquet hall or a home and bring dishes after the ceremonies historians largely believe als was the first shop to sell the sandwich starting in the 1930s the shop is still a mainstay in chicagos little italy neighborhood and others soon followed around the city italian beef becomes a tv star one of those shops mr beef on orleans opened in 1979 situated in the river north neighborhood it was in the shadow of factories says founder and owner joseph zucchero now river north is a trendy neighborhood and patrons still frequent the little shop pop culture happy

watching this week hmmmmeach week the most streamed tv shows and movies come down to a few things  sheer buzz a big finale smart marketing star power critical acclaim or being a wordofmouth phenomenon that leads uninterested people to finally watch it out of spite just to get a sense of what everyones streaming weve used data from streaming aggregator reelgood which gathers those coveted viewership numbers from hundreds of streaming services in the us and ukthis week there are still a few big shows hanging in there  hello again stranger things  along with some newcomers like netflixs resident evil adaptation and kevin kos by all accounts very scary found footage horror incantationbut just because a lot of people are watching something doesnt make itgood here they are the 10 most streamed tv shows and movies of the week where to watch them and what mashable critics thought1 the bear ayo edebiri plays sous chef sydney in the bear credit fx everyones talking about the bear created by christopher storer this new fx series centres on fine dining chef carmy berzatto jeremy allen white who returns to his home city of chicago after he loses a close family member hes tasked with running the family sandwich shop the original beef of chicagoland with sous chef sydney ayo edebiri and manager richie ebon mossbachrach itll be a stressful rewarding and delicious journey  and we loved it so much we recently featured it as our watch of the week  shannon connellan uk editorwhat we thought fxs series about a struggling restaurant and its employees is an onscreen pressure cooker a culinary whirlwind and a rumination on grief all at once that combination slathered with great performances and served with a dose of gritty flair makes for a great sandwich  sorry i meant makes for a great show did i mention youll be very hungry after watching  belen edwards entertainment reporterhow to watch the bear is now streaming on hulu2 better call saul credit greg lewis  amc  sony pictures television if you missed saul goodman bob odenkirk youre clearly not alone the breaking bad prequel now in its sixth and final season remains one of the mostwatched shows of the week odenkirk rhea seehorn and jonathan banks remain excellent as do the rest of the cast but be warned there are some episodes you cant come back from  belen edwards entertainment reporterwhat we thought for several key players the stakes have never been higher reputations relationships and lives are on the line and mounting tension in the first two episodes alone exposes seldomseen sides of characters we thought we had all figured out  nicole gallucci senior editorhow to watch better call saul is now streaming on netflix and on amc3 persuasion credit nick wall  netflix netflixs adaptation of persuasion based on jane austens 1817 novel is loyal to the georgian era in many ways but divergent in others the film stars dakota johnson as heroine anne elliot navigating classic austen themes of love society and marriage directed by carrie cracknell the film hosts an impressive cast including henry golding yolanda kettle ben bailey smith and richard e grant  meera navlakha culture reporterwhat we thought in the novel anne is painted as clever rational and considerate to a fault her concern for the happiness of her family leads her to babysit for a sickly nephew coddle her selfish younger sister and give up the poor sailor she adores because her father doesnt approve of his lack of standing while the movies anne still does all these things her voiceover and fleabaglike sideeye to the viewing audience shifts the emotional weight of these choices from regret to pointed resentment in the end this persuasion is a disappointment because it is too much like its ruthlessly remodeled heroine undeniably clever but a touch too unkind  kristy puchko deputy entertainment editorhow to watch persuasion is now streaming on netflix4 the sea beast credit netflix big hero 6 director chris williams sets sail on a new offering with his animated feature for netflix set within an actionfilled world full of monsters and monster hunters the film follows hunter jacob holland voiced by karl urban as he tracks down the most daunting sea beast the hunter is accompanied by captain crow voiced by jared harris and his first mate sarah sharpe marianne jeanbaptiste as they embark on a quest through magical waters  mnwhat we thought of the greatest things about the sea beast is how candidly it deals with its message just because you were raised to believe something doesnt mean its right if youre willing to open your mind and listen to others you could learn something that will shift your outlook for the better its a great moral and an important one made all the better by the fact that its delivered alongside epic tall ship battles and gorgeous ocean views trust me when i say this is an adventure youll want to watch  belen edwards entertainment reporterhow to watch the sea beast is now streaming on

kos chiller is not only the highestgrossing taiwanese horror film but its also by all accounts pretty darn scary which was probably why netflix decided to scoop it up it was clearly a wise decision

accepted on her behalf the sag awards are being handed out at a tumultuous time for the movie and television business one thats found the leading entertainment companies pledging a new period of belttightening and layoffs that comes after many of these conglomerates have been forced to pay off the debt they accumulated after a period of mergers and acquisitions as well as the costs that came with launching their own streaming services it also takes place as sag and other unions representing screenwriters and directors are negotiating new contracts with their members believing that their compensation is being negatively impacted by the new economics of streaming if agreements arent reached it could lead to labor strikes in a nod to the new ways that people are consuming contentthis years sag awards ditched their standard cable broadcast to air on netflixs youtube channel beginning in 2024 the awards will air directly on the streaming services platform unlike the golden globes which are handed out by a small group of journalists the sag awards are far more predictive of future oscar success thats because the prizes are voted on by the 122000 members of the leading actors
