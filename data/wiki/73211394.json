{"id": 73211394, "key": "High Seas Treaty", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High%20Seas%20Treaty", "text": "The United Nations High Seas Treaty, also known as the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction treaty or the BBNJ treaty, is a legally binding instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. It is an agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The text was finalised during an intergovernmental conference at the UN on 4 March 2023 and adopted on 19 June 2023. Both states and regional economic integration organizations can become parties to the treaty.\n\nThe treaty addresses four themes: (1) Marine genetic resources (MGRs), including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits; (2) area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs); (3) environmental impact assessments (EIAs); and (iv) Capacity building and transfer of marine technology (CB&TMT). The area-based management tools and environmental impact assessments relate mainly to conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity, while the marine genetic resources and capacity building and transfer of marine technology include issues of economic justice and equity.\n\nGreenpeace called it \"the biggest conservation victory ever\". The main achievement is the new possibility to create marine protected areas in international waters. By doing so the agreement now makes it possible to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030 (part of the 30 by 30 target). Though the agreement does not directly address climate change, it also serves as a step towards protecting the ecosystems that store carbon in sediments.\n\nThe treaty has 75 articles and its main purpose is \"to take stewardship of the world’s oceans for present and future generations, care for and protect the marine environment and ensure its responsible use, maintain the integrity of undersea ecosystems and conserve marine biological diversity’s inherent value\". The treaty recognizes traditional knowledge. It has articles regarding the principle \"polluter-pays\", and different impacts of human activities including areas beyond the national jurisdiction of the countries making those activities. The agreement was adopted by the 193 United Nations Member States.\n\nBefore the treaty can enter into force, it needs to be ratified by at least 60 UN member states. This process is likely to take some time. The former treaty, UNCLOS, was adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994. In 2023, UNCLOS is ratified by 167 states and the European Union; however, some states have yet to sign and ratify it.\n\nBackground\n\nThe world’s oceans are facing a severe decline in biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems due to threats related to climate change and the expansion of human activities, such as shipping, overfishing, plastic pollution and deep-sea mining. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a more cohesive ocean governance framework, since the existing framework is too fragmented and incomplete to effectively secure conservation and sustainably use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The High Seas treaty aims to address the regulatory gaps.\n\nThe areas beyond national jurisdiction compromise the 'high seas' (water column) and the ‘area’ (seabeds), making up about two-thirds of the ocean. The areas are currently regulated by different regional and sectoral agreements, such as regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs). However, they can only implement measures within their own respective mandate and cooperation is lacking. Additionally, only a few areas are covered, leaving the majority as good as unregulated. The remaining one-third of the ocean falls under national jurisdiction and is situated within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The exclusive economic zones extend 200 nautical miles (about 370 km) from the territorial sea baseline. The zones are established under UNCLOS, giving coastal states the jurisdiction over the living and non-living resources within the water and the seabeds.\n\nThe negotiations \nA new agreement under UNCLOS for areas beyond national jurisdiction has been discussed at the United Nations for almost 20 years. The United Nations began preparatory meetings in 2004 to lay the foundation for an Implementing Agreement to UNCLOS addressing governance and regulatory gaps. On 24 December 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 72/249 to convene an intergovernmental conference and undertake formal negotiations for a new international legally binding instrument under the UNCLOS for the conservation and sustainable development of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Between 2018 and 2023, diplomats have gathered at the UN Headquarters in New York City for negotiating sessions. There have so far been five sessions in total.\n\nDuring the first session in September 2018, the concept of 'Beyond National Jurisdiction' seemed to have a greater influence on positions taken than the direct concerns regarding 'Biodiversity' itself. \n\nIn the second session March/April 2019, it became clear that the principle stating that the new BBNJ agreement \"should not undermine\" existing institutions could be a hindrance, impeding progress towards achieving an effective instrument. \n\nThe third session in August 2019 evolved around the dichotomy between ‘the freedom of the seas’ and ‘the common heritage of mankind’ principles. \n\nThe fourth session was originally scheduled for 2020, but it had to be postponed until March 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the session, a lack of political will was observed, as states continued to object to substantive, key issues for a new treaty.\n\nThe fifth session took place in August 2022 and significant progress was made, but it was not possible to reach consensus on the final treaty text. It was therefore agreed to suspend the session and resume it at a later date. It was resumed in February/March 2023, and the final text was agreed upon, after almost two decades of work. With the words \"the ship has reached the shore\", Rena Lee, the president of the intergovernmental conference, announced the final agreement. A further resumed fifth session was held on 19 June, where the treaty was adopted. The treaty opened for signature in New York City on 20 September, a day after a summit on the Sustainable Development Goals. Signatures will be open for two years from 20 September 2023.\n\nThe content of the treaty\n\nMarine genetic resources (MGRs), including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits \nMarine genetic resources (MGRs), including the fair and equitable sharing of benefits is the first element mentioned in the treaty. Among other things, marine genetic resources can enable production of biochemicals that can be used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food supplements. The economic value of the resources is for now unclear, but the potential for profits has created an increased interest in the resources exploration and exploitation among stakeholders. \n\nDuring the UN negotiations it has been a contentious point whether or not marine genetic resources should apply to ‘fish’ and ‘fishing activities’. If not, it would be likely to impact the ability of the High Seas treaty to address its objective, since fish are a major component of marine biodiversity and play an essential role in the functioning of marine ecosystems, according to some experts. However, the final treaty text states that the provisions about marine genetic resources do not apply to ‘fish’ and ‘fishing’ in areas beyond national jurisdiction. \n\nThe part about fair and equitable sharing of benefits has also been a point of dispute in the negotiations. In the end it was agreed upon to regulate non-monetary as well as monetary benefits. Furthermore, an access and benefit-sharing committee will be established with the purpose of providing guidelines for the benefit-sharing, and ensuring that this is done in a transparent, fair, and equitable way.\n\nArea-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs) \nArea-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs) are recognized as key tools for conserving and restoring biodiversity. They can be used to protect, preserve and maintain certain areas beyond national jurisdiction. Marine protected areas offer a degree of long term conservation, and are already established in some areas. However, the protection level of biodiversity varies a lot and the protected areas only cover a small proportion of the areas beyond national jurisdiction. Area based management tools can be used for short-term and emergency measures and to address a specific sector.\n\nThe process to establish a tool or a protected area is as follows. First, a part under the High Seas treaty has to submit a proposal for an area-based management tool or a marine protected area. The proposal has to be based on the best available sciences and information. It will be made publicly available and transmitted to the Scientific and Technical Body to be reviewed. Hereafter, relevant stakeholders have to be consulted. The proposal has to be adopted by consensus - or if this is not possible, three-quarter majority of the representatives present and voting. The decision will enter into force within 120 days after the voting, and will be binding for all parties of the treaty. However, if a part within the 120 days makes an objection to the decision, an opt-out is possible.\n\nAfter the treaty text was finalised, it has been reported that the treaty through marine protected areas will protect 30 pct. of the oceans by 2030 - a target adopted at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in December 2022 - however this is not the case, according to experts. The treaty can help to implement the 30 by 30 biodiversity target in the oceans, but it will a require a lot of action by states.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) \nEnvironmental impact assessments have the potential to predict, reduce and prevent human activities affecting marine biodiversity and ecosystems. While the institutional and legal framework for environmental impact assessments is well established in areas within national jurisdiction, it is less developed in areas beyond. Under the treaty, participating parties are obliged to conduct environmental impact assessments when a planned activity may have an effect on the marine environment, or when there is insufficient knowledge about its potential effects. In such cases, the party possessing jurisdiction or control over the activity is required to conduct the assessment.\n\nThe treaty also includes provisions for Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs), which are assessments that are more holistic and focused on long-term environmental protection compared to the more specific focus of environmental impact assessments. Parties under the treaty have to consider conducting a strategic environmental assessment for plans and programmes related to their activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction, but are not obliged to conduct one.\n\nCapacity building and the transfer of marine technology (CB&TMT) \nCapacity building and the transfer of marine technology concerns the equitable access to research conducted in international waters and enabling cooperation and participation in the activities outlined in the agreement. Different types of capacity building and transfer of technology are mentioned in the agreement, such as sharing of information and research results; develop and share manuals, guidelines and standards; collaboration and cooperation in marine science; and develop and strengthen institutional capacity and national regulation or mechanisms.\n\nTechnology plays an important role in the implementation, making capacity building and technology transfer essential for the enforcement of the treaty. A key focus is to support developing and geographically disadvantaged states in implementing the agreement. \n\nFurthermore, a capacity-building and transfer of marine technology committee will be established, in order to monitor and review the undertaken initiatives, under the authority of the Conference of the Parties.\n\nInstitutional Setup \nThe treaty introduces a new institutional framework in part VI about 'Institutional Arrangements', including the Conference of the Parties, the Scientific and Technical Body, the secretariat and the clearing-house mechanism.\n\nThe Conference of the parties (COP) will have its first meeting one year after the treaty enters into force, at the latest. The rules of procedure and the financial rules will be adopted at the first meeting. The Conference of the Parties will review and evaluate the implementation of the High Seas treaty. The Conference has to take decisions and adopt recommendations by consensus - or if it is not possible to reach consensus after all efforts have been exhausted, adopted by a two-thirds majority of the parties present and voting. The Conference will also have to promote transparency in the implementation of the agreement and the related activities. Five years after the treaty enters into force, the Conference of Parties has to review the treaty. \n\nThe Scientific and Technical Body will be composed of members nominated by the parties and elected by the Conference of the Parties, serving as experts and in the best interest of the agreement. The need for multidisciplinary expertise has to be taken into account in the nomination and election of members. The Scientific and Technical Body will among other things provide scientific and technical advice to the Conference of the Parties, monitor and review area-based management tools and comment on environmental impact assessments.\n\nThe secretariat is responsible for providing administrative and logistical support to the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies. This includes tasks, such as arranging and servicing the meetings, as well as circulating information relating to the implementation of the treaty in a timely manner.\n\nThe clearing-house mechanism will work as an open-access platform, facilitating the access, provision, and dissemination of information. It will promote transparency and facilitate international cooperation and collaboration. The mechanism will be managed by the secretariat. \n\nIn addition, the treaty establishes an 'access and benefit-sharing committee', a 'capacity-building and transfer of marine technology committee', a 'finance committee on financial resources' and an 'implementation and compliance committee'. However, these are not mentioned in the section about institutional arrangements.\n\nSee also\n2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference\nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nHigh seas fisheries management\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nUN delegates reach historic agreement on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters (UN News, 5 March 2023)\nAgreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (19 June 2023)\n\n2023 in international relations\nUnited Nations treaties\nProposed treaties\nMarine conservation\nLaw of the sea treaties\nOpen environmental policy proposals", "unikey": "High Seas Treaty", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "The_negotiations", "The_content_of_the_treaty", "Institutional_Setup", "See_also", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["The world’s oceans are facing a severe decline inbiodiversityand degradation ofecosystemsdue to threats related toclimate changeand the expansion of human activities, such asshipping,overfishing,plastic pollutionanddeep-sea mining.Consequently, there is a pressing need for a more cohesiveocean governanceframework, since the existing framework is too fragmented and incomplete to effectively secure conservation and sustainably use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.

kaye 2004 point to the difficulties of conducting eias in abnj ma et al 2016 and argue that compliance can be achieved through economic incentives blasiak and yagi 2016 academic output deals with the economic benefits of mpas when spillover effects for fisheries spurring selfinterested implementation blasiak and yagi 2016 as well as the commercial and ecological benefits of mgrs the ocean genome blasiak and yagi 2016 blasiak et al 2020 apart from incentives monitoring and control are identified as crucial for compliance blasiak and yagi 2016 altvater et al 2019 to deal with noncompliance the literature discusses the possibility of a compliance committee drankier et al 2012 durussel et al 2017 gjerde et al 2019 it also recommends compensation payments into a rehabilitation or liability fund to enshrine the noharm and polluterpays principles in law long 2019 the role of science science has a significant place in each of the package elements of the future bbnj treaty knowledge about the ocean and its ecosystems is still limited with a majority of marine species being new to science rabone et al 2019 marine research is therefore needed in order to understand the worlds ecosystems rochette and bille 2008 moreover marine genetic compounds have been used to develop products for the pharmaceutical biofuel and chemical industries blasiak et al 2018 it is widely argued that scientific and other forms of knowledge ought to contribute to decisionmaking and the implementation of policies van dover et al 2016 gjerde et al 2019 gownaris et al 2019 and that scientific cooperation is needed hardendavies and gjerde 2019 rabone et al 2019 marine scientific research for exploration and exploitation marine scientific research msr is intrinsically linked to marine genetic resources which can either be part of samples or the object of study unclos guarantees the freedom of scientific research on the high seas unclos art 87 under certain environmental standards and restrictions despite uncertainty concerning monetary benefits from mgrs blasiak and yagi 2016 hardendavies 2017b yu 2019 most of the literature expects promising economic gains to be derived from mgrs nurbintoro and nugroho 2016 scovazzi 2016 van dover et al 2016 beckerweinberg 2017 current literature on the relationship between msr and mgrs is biased toward a preference for keeping the status quo ie allowing free and open access to mgrs in order not to impede scientific research and developments of new products a small share of the literature mentions access to otherwise restricted areas through msr in the ats case li 2018 and the threat of overexploitation of marine biodiversityincluding mgrsthrough or in the name of research kaye 2004 it recommends introducing a duty of care when collecting mgrs and restricting access to vulnerable marine ecosystems such as ebsas and mpas voigthanssen 2018 or standards and criteria for responsible sampling activities eg in form of a code of conduct yu 2019 many scholars however emphasize the opportunity provided by the bbnj agreement to strengthen bestpractice mgr access sharing and transparency broggiato et al 2014 2018 collins et al 2019 rabone et al 2019 the sharing of information regarding planned research activities type purpose scope and timeline and the monitoring and regulation of impacts as well as the sharing of research results are viewed as useful tools to prevent environmental harm as is reporting on research and exploration activities in international waters hassanali 2018 sciencepolicy interfaces for ocean protection as much as science is needed to explore and exploit the marine environment it also lays the foundation for efficient ocean protection including the identification and creation of high seas abmts including mpas dias et al 2017 mossop 2018 scientific evidence can inform effective mpa establishment to maintain and restore populations increase resilience of the ecosystem and provide socioeconomic benefits gownaris et al 2019 a literature review by gownaris et al 2019 shows that such benefits can only be achieved if mpas are appropriately sited strongly protected and effectively managed given that their establishment has in the past not always relied upon best available science the quality of mpas varies significantly gownaris et al 2019 large scale mpas larger than 30000 km2 seek to meet quantitative global targets set by the cbd and sustainable development goal 145 however their contribution to biodiversity conservation has been debated davies et al 2017 it has been argued that quality goals including equitably and effectively managed wellconnected and ecologically representative networks of mpas will not be met oleary and roberts 2018 since the best available science is needed to identify mpas various scientists have published their findings with the aim to contribute to effective mpa establishment oleary et al 2012 ban et al 2014a selig et al 2014 evans et al 2015 dias et al 2017 gjerde et al 2019 gownaris et al 2019 their publications contribute to the bbnj process by providing guidance on suitable sites for mpas ie those with a high biodiversity value thatregardless of their wellknown prestige ecosystemsare lacking in comprehensive mpa coverage selig et al 2014 dias et al 2017 scientific studies highlight the policy relevance of biogeographic classifications rice et al 2011 gjerde et al 2016 point to certain deepsea habitats in need of protection johnson 2019 and to over 76 million km2 of unprotected abnj that have already been identified as important and could act as a starting point for the bbnj process gownaris et al 2019 a geospatial analysis of existing abmts in deepsea environments seeks to inform ecosystembased management on the high seas menini and van dover 2019 bbnj authors point out that the 1972 world heritage convention does not include international waters but science has identified various sites in need of protection laffoley and freestone 2017 to prevent the designation of mpas in areas of low biodiversity value and support conservation objective criteria must be used such as the presence of pelagic seabirds which indicate greater marine biodiversity dias et al 2017 or the occurrence of prestige sponges on tropical seamounts ramirosanchez et al 2019 a combination of vme taxa records and predictive habitat models can provide scientific evidence to support sustainable management avoid the adverse impacts of exploitation and suggest new sites for mpas serving as the basis for ebsas and large vmes nomination ramirosanchez et al 2019 one part of the bbnj literature examines lessons learnt and bestpractice examples of the use of best available science in decisionmaking case studies of the ospar and camlr scientific committees show that scientific advice is often disregarded or wrongly implemented and that input from social science is completely missing although it is regarded as essential for the design of effective conservation measures de santo 2018 thus advocates of giving strong decisionmaking powers to a future bbnj scientific and technical body call for a politically highly influential design de santo 2018 increasingly there are calls to include other forms of knowledge into policymaking across all package elements including traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples and local communities dunstan et al 2016 ridings 2018 voigthanssen 2018 johnson et al 2019a scott 2019 humphries et al 2020 and the perspectives of resource managers interest groups de santo 2018 civil society actors and the private sector kraabel in press this part of the bbnj literature points to existing instruments see tables 4 5 including the aarhus convention with its general principles and approaches of public participation transparency and information availability de santo 2018 the faos 2009 international guidelines for the management of deepsea fisheries in the high seas criteria for vme identification based on the best available scientific knowledge and expert judgment johnson et al 2018 the camlr scientific committee de santo 2018 scientific advice for decisionmaking in ospar and the northeast atlantic fisheries commission neafc by the international council for the exploration of the sea ices de santo 2018 and the permanent commission for the south pacific cpps with its climaterelated scientific research across the region durussel et al 2017 scientific cooperation scientific expertise combined with capacity building supports the global communitys understanding of how the ocean is changing bax et al 2018 scientific research may be seen as a vehicle for benefitsharing through scientific and technological capacity building hardendavies and gjerde 2019 it is argued that capacity development and technology transfer toward sustainable ocean use have to focus on actionable information requiring emphasis on elements of the ocean that are most relevant to the global community such as fisheries and living habitat bax et al 2018 research on science diplomacy grants science an opportunity to give way to more pragmatic discussions of scientific capacity development and technology transfer rather than to focus on an ideological divide in the negotiations hardendavies 2018 and to engage actors on arctic issues kraabel in press under the future bbnj agreement international marine scientific research can generate knowledge technology transfer can be used to share this knowledge and capacity development enables the application of knowledge in practice hardendavies 2018 suggestions include participation in research programs and the exchange of scientists ridings 2018 the sharing of knowledge about activities that affect marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction including research and extraction is crucial for the conservation and sustainable use of bbnj ridings 2018 can give greater access to patented genetic resources and strengthen research capacity and support the conservation of wild stocks humphries 2018 scientific capacity building enables global monitoring management and adaption to ocean change bax et al 2018 mossop 2018 research on the bbnj negotiations highlights the link between the cbtt element and all other treaty topics mgr access and utilization monitoring and enforcement of abmts and the evaluation of eias de santo et al 2020 new instruments of the arctic council namely the scientific cooperation agreement and the agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central arctic ocean cao include key provisions for scientific cooperation and can be regarded as bestpractice examples kraabel in press digital technology for implementation of the bbnj agreement digital technology plays a role for each of the package elements advances in technology and increased demand have added stressors on the marine environment oleary and roberts 2017 resulting in biodiversity loss as well as the destruction of prestige marine ecosystems oleary and roberts 2018 oleary et al 2020 scientific research on mgrs is heavily dependent on new technology to take samples in the deep sea broggiato et al 2018 and retrieve genetic sequence data rabone et al 2019 online databases provide worldwide access to data and genetic material including for developing countries that were not initially involved in the access of the mgrs in situ namely at sea simultaneously digital technology can support ocean conservation measures by identifying marine biodiversity occurrences and threats novel genetic technologies offer opportunities to conserve the ocean genome blasiak et al 2020 it therefore plays a significant role as regards abmts and mpas satellite tracking combined with open and near realtime accessibility will assist the protection of highly migratory marine vertebrates sequeira et al 2019 marine and aerial autonomous systems satellitebased remote sensing telemetry and systems combining automatic identification systems ais with satellite tracking can predict highseas fishing effort and assess the potential exposure of coastal regions to adjacent fishing pressure popova et al 2019 bbnj authors also examine the spatial ecology and drivers of the global distribution of the highseas longline fishing fleet by using newly available ais data to predict fishing effort distribution crespo et al 2018 as regards the interconnectedness of the ocean one way to identify mpas that take into account migratory connectivity is to establish mobile mpas informed by satellite data maxwell et al 2020 partnerships with the military or industries with access to crucial technologies to study or manage remote ocean areas including remote sensing technologies can provide new resources for the conservation and monitoring of abnj gjerde et al 2016 technology will also be needed for mpa surveillance purposes and compliance with the bbnj agreement rochette et al 2014a rowlands et al 2019 studies by bbnj authors that are based on monitoring control and surveillance mechanisms used by rfmos argue that the new instrument could be an opportunity to introduce ais technology for monitoring control and surveillance on the high seas which would improve biodiversity conservation and management in international waters and enhance compliance dunn et al 2018 digital technology allows for near realtime monitoring of fishing vessels popova et al 2019 new technologies include vessel tracking systems eg the vessel monitoring system vms and ais which facilitate the surveillance and monitoring of marine fisheries even in remote waters crespo et al 2018 bbnj authors point out that currently not all vessels are required to carry ais devices and regulations vary according to vessel type size nationality and fishing location crespo et al 2018 mpas larger than 100000 km2 require improvements in satellite monitoring to detect violations rowlands et al 2019 the role of technology in the implementation of the bbnj agreement underscores the importance of the cbtt package technology transfer can facilitate access to satellite databases such as ais to track the location of fishing activities and increase the management capacity of states and rfmos dunn et al 2018 in this way it can support developing states in managing and monitoring fishing activities and impacts bax et al 2018 for an effective implementation of high seas abmts the involvement of a range of stakeholders will also be crucial including the fisheries industry and scientific community for instance data collection and sharing might demonstrate the added value of mpas and generate selfinterest in their implementation blasiak and yagi 2016 with the help of ais data governance gaps can be identified abmts monitored and the states and rfmos management capacity strengthened dunn et al 2018 discussion and conclusion the following section discusses the results of the bbnj literature review it also offers some critical reflections on the corpus and the authors findings and recommendations we identify two important gaps that will need to be addressed in future research on the effective conservation of marine biodiversity in abnj firstly research on sciencepolicy interfaces in bbnj governance and secondly linking the bbnj process to the need for transformative change closer interplay between science and policy is a must the findings and recommendations from the scientific community publishing on bbnj issues show that there is a need for a stronger interplay between science and policy and a systematic identification of windows of opportunities for a more efficient uptake of science into the bbnj process and later treaty implementation rose et al 2017 this encompasses the need for 1 formalized processes to facilitate sciencepolicy interfaces in the bbnj negotiations and 2 an independent international expert body representing multiple scientific disciplines expertise from various regions and diverse knowledge forms to ensure the inclusion of science and knowledge for the implementation of the treaty this literature review has revealed the willingness of the bbnj scientific community to contribute to the negotiations and shape their outcome as shown by its readiness to provide relevant scientific data and recommendations concerning the new instrument our findings indicate that the community is concerned about how the new treaty might shape the conservation and use of bbnj the corpus of normative papers mostly calls for a strong and ambitious agreement concretely the voice of science in bbnj affairs is calling for a more holistic ecosystembased and precautionary perspective to ocean governance that takes into account ocean connectivity and climate change impacts while the bbnj scientific community is pointing to marine biodiversity threats and offering possible solutions some of these calls are opposed by policymakers involved in the bbnj negotiations the current draft of the bbnj treatywith only one further igc plannedhas so far only incorporated the requirements defined by the bbnj scientific community to meet the treatys objectives to a limited extent moreover parallel political international processes on abnjrelated issues such as climate and biodiversity conferences of the parties cops or negotiations of the isa will also have to be connected if a holistic solution is to be found our findings also indicate that the bbnj scientific community needs to expand and diversify the literature sample of this review mainly consists of academic output by authors affiliated with europe 46 oceania 21 and north america 20 but lacks input from asia 8 latin america 4 and africa 1 while authors have a variety of academic backgrounds law is the most prevalent discipline throughout the sample with more than half of bbnj authors from that discipline information from participant lists and sideevent programs of bbnj negotiations shows that 35 of the 99 authors were directly involvedattending at least one of the three intergovernmental conferences igcs5 either as observers from universities or nongovernmental organizations or at the negotiation table within national delegations which influences the interrelation between negotiations and academic output with the limitation of looking explicitly at peerreviewed academic literature in english the main voice of science is that of authors and research institutes from the global north providing scientific findings as well as suggestions regarding the emergence development and implementation of the agreement given that our sample only includes scientific literature explicitly referring to the bbnj process there is a large body of marine and climate science literature missing from this analysis that may be relevant for the negotiations this reveals the need to further encourage links between marine scientific research and the ongoing bbnj process recent science and knowledge should be brought to the decisionmakers negotiating table such as research on deepsea environments and the characteristics of marine species in this regard potential communication barriers need to be bridged to identify the significance of the findings and results need to be connected to the political realities at hand for the policymakers to perceive science as relevant this could inform policymaking regarding access to and utilization of mgrs the identification of abmts including mpas and the need for eias since there is a shortage of bbnj research originating from the global south we recommend facilitating cooperation to guarantee their inclusion in the scientific community the cbtt element of the negotiations can significantly contribute to this aim scientists working on topics related to areas further than 200 nautical miles away from the shore on marine species migrating into those areas or on genetic material from these areas are encouraged to link their research to the political bbnj process to make their work policyrelevant and engage in the sciencepolicy interfaces moreover policymakers are encouraged to reach out to experts working on the abovementioned topics even if these are not aware of or involved in the political process in this way the bbnj scientific community could grow and include other forms of knowledge relevant for the bbnj negotiations in this regard science and knowledge can notably shape the applicability of treaty provisions regarding the processes of how to govern mgrs establish abmts including mpas conduct eias and ensure cbtt yet we need future research on designing sciencepolicy institutions by identifying the social relevance of science and knowledge for the international community when seeking to regulate global commons research on effective sciencepolicy interfaces emphasize the need for salient credible and legitimate informationbase in policymaking cash et al 2003 however perceptions of saliency credibility and legitimacy can differ in certain political situations within particular political and cultural settings lidskog and sundqvist 2002 this underlines the importance of understanding the different values and norms behind the production and interpretation of science and knowledge jasanoff 2004 especially in international negotiations where representatives from around the world are expected to jointly agree on the way forward while literature exists on such social relevance in the climate and biodiversity fields beck et al 2014 vadrot 2020a research on effective sciencepolicy interfaces in bbnj in this regard is still lacking and constitutes significant potential for the protection of marine global commons transformative change for bbnj objectives while literature in our sample exemplifies the need for an ambitious bbnj treaty based on precaution and recognizes the need for a holistic ecosystembased approach to ocean governance it tends to limit itselfwith a few exceptionsto a narrow interpretation of the law of the sea while the bbnj treaty will indeed be an implementing agreement of unclos and should not undermine its provisions the dramatic acceleration of environmental degradation in the ocean should encourage us to think beyond existing legal and institutional structures and to acknowledge that the institutions we have established to tackle the loss of marine biodiversity are embedded in political and economic contexts literature from our sample seems to recognize the need for transforming the institutional and legal conditions for ocean protection however no connections have yet been made to the ongoing debate on transformative change within the intergovernmental sciencepolicy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes authors of the first global ipbes assessment concluded that global biodiversity loss could only be reversed by addressing both direct and indirect drivers and by introducing transformative change into our societies ipbes 2019 the underlyingeconomic sociocultural demographic political institutional and technologicalindirect drivers behind the direct drivers are the root causes of biodiversity loss in our societies diaz et al 2019 transformative change would entail a fundamental systemwide reorganization across technological economic and social factors making sustainability the norm rather than the altruistic exception diaz et al 2019 using this ambitious frameworkwhich already guides debates within the cbdto govern bbnj affairs would open up a new pathway toward the effective conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity thus we propose that future research by the bbnj scientific community should concentrate on exemplifying the kind of transformative change that would be needed and how indirect drivers of marine biodiversity loss can be considered in the new bbnj treaty and its implementation as scientific findings on ocean connectivity and the interaction between the ocean and the climate show existing political and legal structures cannot guarantee the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity the traditional way of drawing borders in the marine environment and the desire to privatize and nationalize marine space and resources does not account for such interconnections and is failing to ensure governance aims for marine biodiversity academic literature from the social sciences may help us bring together the ongoing bbnj debate and transformative change vadrot et al 2018 this includes research on our international system economy politics and structural factors that led to the current state of the oceans in need of protection and regulation especially the politics behind some of the tensions that we see in the negotiations would benefit from research on the negotiation dynamics themselves including struggles over environmental knowledge vadrot 2020b while the ocean lays mostly outside of national jurisdiction still states are the actors that will decide on the future of marine biodiversity as shown in the literature political and economic interests have in the past prevented marine protection in spaces that from an ecological point of view were identified as vulnerable a change in these structures would require a critical view on the status quo of international negotiations the critical appraisal of the limits and the future of multilateralism consideration of diverse knowledge forms and the imagination for new ways of governing areas that belong to all vadrot 2020b alternative ideas wyborn et al 2020 on using and sharing ocean resources including other forms of knowledge such as local and indigenous knowledge and philosophical insights into the question of humankinds right to own the ocean and its resourcescould help us arrive at alternative solutions that have so far not been sufficiently considered these could greatly enrich international policymaking options and broaden the scope of debate given its focus on the potential economic value of mgrs and its aim to counterbalance inequalities between the global north and the global south the bbnj literature has failed to consider the intrinsic value of marine biodiversity although conservation and sustainable use are discussed at length in the debate on how the oceans resources may be efficiently used and how an equitable sharing of benefits may be guaranteed the fact that biodiversity has a value in itselfwithout being monetizedis only touched on by few authors gjerde et al 2019 hardendavies et al 2020 ethical considerations whether and how to explore and exploit marine life and reflections on who has decisionmaking power to govern ocean activities fall short in current scientific debates as well as in the negotiations themselves these ethical questions however need to be addressed in the light of governing a global commons bbnj outlook the bbnj literature is quickly growing and we observe a significant increase in publications while we approach the nextplanned to be finalnegotiation round of bbnj recent publicationsonly accessible to us after completion of the systematic reviewcover important and timely issues related to diverse elements of the bbnj treaty regarding the package element mgrs this includes valuable insights on stakeholder perspectives on access and benefit sharing for mgrs collins et al 2020 and the consideration of digital sequence information as a marine genetic resource lawson and rourke 2020 concerning the abmts package and more specifically marine protection recent publications include the identification of priority areas for protection in abnj visalli et al 2020 the importance of the protection of high seas coral reefs wagner et al 2020 scientific and legal considerations for dynamic abmts crespo et al 2020 and a network of seamount mpas marsac et al 2020 as regards to eias new research evaluates the prospects for effective environmental assessment under the new instrument and

fourth and planned to be last igcthere is a significant willingness of stakeholders including state and nonstate actors to keep the momentum and stay engaged in discussions around bbnj this can be seen in extensive and active participation by state delegates in online webinars and dialogues organized by individual state actors and civil society as well as in semiformally organized intersessional work by the un secretariat to engage delegations in diving deeper into unresolved issues in all package elements involvement in discussions on textual work interest in clarifications on bbnj issues and collaboration among bbnj stakeholders over the past months show the motivation of state delegations to be engaged in the multilateral dialogue and offer hope for the upcoming formal negotiation round  that will decide over the future of marine biodiversityto take the calls from the scientific community into account ongoing intersessional work and engagement with scientists and the civil society until the next igc can serve consensusbuilding among state representatives insofar as it grants more time to discuss contentious issues and let the voice of science and civil society play a more central role it is also in this regard that our systematic literature review may enrich ongoing negotiations and serve stakeholders interested in the bbnj process and its diverse elements to navigate smoothly through the already existing research and recommendations that cover a broad range of issues and ideas scientists may identify new avenues for research and policymakers may find novel approaches already circulating among the bbnj community while intersessional online meetings and final multilateral discussions at the upcoming igc indeed offer the opportunity to design an ambitious agreement fit to fulfill its objectives it remains to be seen to what extent the voice of science will be heard during the bbnj negotiations data availability statement the original

shkodras lake a body of water that straddles albania and montenegro which is shown above gent shkullakuafp via getty images hide caption toggle caption gent shkullakuafp via getty images gent shkullakuafp via getty images after nearly two decades of planning and negotiations members of the united nations have agreed on an international treaty to protect biodiversity in international waters which cover nearly twothirds of the ocean the agreement finalized late saturday lays the groundwork for global collaboration to tackle the oceans persistent threats like biodiversity loss pollution and climate change i believe that this treaty is like a second chance for the ocean said gladys martínez the executive director of aida a group focused on protecting the environment primarily in latin america and has been involved with treaty discussions science one of bidens biggest climate change challenges the oceans the historic treaty is a major step toward the goal to protect at least 30 of ocean areas by 2030  a target president biden laid out for the us in 2021 and part of a broader land and marine conservation unled commitment known as 30x30 heres what to know about why this treaty matters right now international waters are largely unregulated the ocean is facing threats on multiple fronts commercial fishing operations span more than half the worlds ocean and have been detrimental to species and their habitats according to the world wildlife fund more than a third of all sharks rays and a sharklike fish called chimaera are at risk of extinction because of overfishing the organization also found that almost every species group in the ocean has encountered plastic pollution often swallowing or being entangled by it additionally manmade climate change causes the ocean to get hotter threatening marine life and coastal communities the salt microplastics have invaded the deep ocean  and the food chain national here is what scientists are doing to save floridas coral reef before its too late those problems are compounded by another dilemma right now international waters are largely governed by a fragmented patchwork of global agreements and organizations there was no way to coordinate between these kinds of organizations said elizabeth mendenhall a marine affairs professor at the university of rhode island who researches ocean governance so areas get overburdened overexploited they get more than they can handle because there isnt like a coordinated holistic perspective she added another issue is that there is no international body committed to preserving biological diversity in regions outside territorial seas or ground rules on accessing genetic resources found in international waters mendenhall said the treaty has four main objectives lisa speer director of the natural resources defense councils international oceans program told nprs a martínez on morning edition the biggest conservationrelated accomplishment of the new treaty is that it paves the way to establish largescale marine protected areas which the nrdc describes as the oceans equivalent of a grand canyon or yellowstone national park that means in about 30 percent of the worlds oceans damaging human activities like commercial fishing and oil gas drilling could be prohibited or limited and the science tells us that is the single most important thing we can do to enhance ocean resilience in the face of growing threats related to climate change speer said climate your next car may be built with ocean rocks scientists cant agree if thats good the treaty will also regulate countries and companies who can access and benefit sharing from the commercialization of marine genetic resources which can be useful for the creation of pharmaceuticals or cosmetics according to speer who was part of the un negotiating team ensuring those resources will be shared in a fair and equitable way was a major point of tension in the negotiations who gets to decide what happens in this global commons was a fundamental issue on the table during the negotiations she said similarly the treaty is aimed at making research conducted in international waters more accessible and inclusive especially for developing countries a fourth major component of the agreement is setting global standards for environmental impact assessments on commercial activities in the ocean these evaluations will also consider cumulative impact or combined and incremental impacts resulting from different activities countries will need to work together speer from the nrdc said that implementing the treaty is not only crucial for the waters outside national jurisdictions but also for the regions and countries within it its important because billions of people around the world rely on the ocean for basic needs  their food their jobs their income their sustenance culturally as well as economically she said after the yearslong effort to finalize the treaty it is now up to countries to decide whether they will adopt the treaty into domestic law for example the us has yet to ratify the un convention on the law of the sea which was the last international treaty on ocean protection signed over 40 years ago climate heres how far behind the world is on reining in climate change we have the text so we have to turn this text into our reality martínez from aida said

availability statementthe authors do not have permission to share dataabstractafter a two year delay caused by the covid19 pandemic the fourth intergovernmental conference igc4 in the negotiations for a new un treaty to address the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bbnj took place in march 2022 this meeting differed substantially from previous igcs in terms of process with much of the discussions occurring in informal informals or offtherecord meetings open only to delegates and registered observers additionally inperson participation was extremely limited and observers only had access to web broadcasts ie no inperson interactions with delegates a draft text of the treaty was circulated in advance and provided the basis for discussion and negotiation at the meeting this paper examines igc4 in line with previous analyses of the first three igcs tracing the process and outcomes to date aiming to understand the factors and players that are building a new bbnj agreement key themes explored include marine genetic resources mgrs areabased management tools including marine protected areas abmtsmpas environmental impact assessment eia and capacity building and transfer of marine technology cbtmt some progress toward consensus has been made buoyed by intersessional discussions but several sticking points remain with regard to definitions content and processes enshrined in the draft treaty and a fifth igc is scheduled to take place from 15 to 26 august 2022keywords unclos bbnj high seas marine genetic resources mpas environmental impact assessment1 introductionafter a long hiatus due to the covid19 pandemic the 4th session of the intergovernmental conference igc4 of the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bbnj negotiations convened from march 718th at the united nations headquarters in new york the bbnj process intends to produce the third implementing agreement to the united nations convention on the law of the sea unclos and must be fully consistent with the framework convention  equitable access and the ability to deal with difficult political topics were common concernsaccess concerns persisted in igc4 although igc4 took place inperson the covid19 pandemic shaped its modalities in ways that affected transparency a mere three weeks before negotiations began president rena lee held successive briefings with representatives of intergovernmental igos and nongovernmental organizations ngos to share information about access member states were limited to 2 people1 in the negotiation room and no observers including from igos or ngos would be allowed this decreased the possibilities for academic research including onsite inperson interviews and ethnographic observations and importantly interventions however a webex video link was provided to all registered participants and although this did not allow participation via verbal interventions observers were allowed to submit written statements and text proposals the evening before each session and crucially even the informal informal sessions would be observable via video link this represented a significant improvement to transparency over igc3 where igo and ngo representatives had to determine among themselves who would get only 10 seats 5 for each group within the informal informal rooms  in contrast igc4 was almost entirely composed of informal informals although in practice these ran essentially the same way as working groups they were not streamed via un web tv and were only virtually accessible to registered participants via webex negotiation leadership requested that observers not report details of who said what during these informal informals this is intended to enhance the possibilities for compromise giving coalitions and delegations the freedom to express where they might be flexible without concern for political repercussions at home however this modality makes it very difficult for researchers to convey what is actually happening at negotiations with a broader audience in this paper we do our best to share information about the progress of negotiations without violating the request of the leadership to not divulge too much information we therefore refer to issues and topics that were discussed in a general manner and not specific to any individual state or coalition any specific naming of countries or coalitions reflects positions that are publicly available on the bbnj website which includes text proposals circulated as conference room papers as well as statements voluntarily uploaded by delegations and the oral reports of the facilitators2 3 direction not detailigc4 had a notably different tenor and tone to previous sessions interventions focused on both the revised draft text and sets of questions formulated and circulated by the leadership during the session this approach had a flexible feel  for example midway through the igc delegates asked president lee to circulate questions the night before and she graciously obliged although many interventions included detailed comments on and proposals for the text similar to igc3 there was also a return to more general comments about the design of the agreement as president lee often repeated were looking for direction not detail states signaled their agreement with one another more often even taking the time to list particular coalitions and delegations they agreed with this included more qualified comments about text proposals they consider favorably or could look on positively as delegations shared their positions and opinions they also noted their degree of flexibility on an issue as per president lees request this approach may serve both cooperative and particularistic ends on one hand it signals and boosts preferences around which consensus is forming on the other hand highlighting groups that agree with you and indicating your willingness to be flexible on some issues can be understood as a means of boosting the credibility of both the speaker and their stated preferencesthis change in tenor left participants and observers with an undeniable feeling of progress although at least one additional igc will be needed to finalize the agreement scheduled for august 2022 the earth negotiations bulletin summary of negotiations noted that many participants lauded the productivity of igc4  shortly thereafter the ipcc released part of its sixth assessment report which emphasized the critical need for conservation of 3050 of land freshwater and ocean areas these developments may have encouraged states to try to do more quickly and align themselves with other agreements under negotiation or implementation this urgency is especially evident in the high ambition coalition a commitment made by 20 states and the european unions 27 member states at the february 2022 one ocean summit to swiftly conclude the bbnj treaty in 2022however urgency to conclude an agreement cannot create consensus it may therefore be that the positive feeling at igc4 represents a false sense of progress rather than actual significant progress toward a final treaty two alternative explanations should be taken into account in order to temper the optimism about completing treaty negotiations in 2022 first the format of negotiations could explain the apparent degree of movement the revised draft text3 had been streamlined relative to the first draft considered in igc3 such that interventions were less laden with precise references to specific options and alternatives in the draft text the informal informal format generated more backandforth exchanges and facilitators were more likely to pivot in response to the direction of discussions second the agenda was circumscribed and arguably the most controversial topics were not even covered at igc4 except obliquely as one facilitator noted nothing has been agreed until everything has been agreed and we are a long way from that in short it is easier to build and express consensus on direction than detail and indeed there are still a number of ambiguities and omissionsas well as incomplete provisions in the draft text the following sections consider each of the four main issue areas and the topic of institutional arrangements in turn as discussed during igc4 this enables us to assess the progress of negotiations in each area evaluate the likelihood of consensusbuilding on key topics and analyze the factors that are influencing trends in the design of a bbnj agreement4 elements of the bbnj package41 marine genetic resourcesi want to remind everybody of my favorite word in all its permutations  you can flex you are flexible you have flexibilityi hope to hear that word a lot in all permutations president rena lee at the start of the mgrs workstreammgrs remain one of the most contentious issue areas for three reasons first the topics of access and benefit sharing are riven with ideological positions concerning the acquisition and status of property seen especially in the opposition between the concepts of common heritage and free market enterprise the g77china coalition continues to insist that the common heritage of mankind chm principle is the underlying legal and moral principle for mgrs while technologically advanced countries emphasize the need to not impede or discourage research and development by private entities in the background is the shared knowledge that patents associated with mgrs are held by a small number of dominant private and national actors 4 1 second the institutional arrangements proposed to manage mgr access and benefit sharing vary widely in their degree of regulatory requirements even if the ideological dispute over guiding principles was resolved there would still be a need to establish clear rules for storing regulating and monitoring mgr use  many states are unenthusiastic about the degree of complication and intervention necessary to achieve preferred outcomes related to mgrs especially compared to existing marine scientific research practices  all of these patterns were evident at igc4 and much of the core debate was centralized on the definition of terms in article 1 these fundamental issues suggest that the mgrs part of the bbnj agreement may be the most difficult to achieve consensus on411 access vs collection president lee took advantage of an early finish to cbtmt discussions to begin with an hour of mgr discussion on day 2 of the negotiations due to the inability of the previous facilitator to attend igc4 president lee ran the mgr workstream herself beginning with the examination of article 10 of the revised draft text which concerns collection andor access to mgrs early statements noted significant movement in the intersessional period including the circulation of texts yet major disagreements persist about whether the bbnj agreement should regulate access to or collection of mgrs major developing state coalitions expressed support for access while a large number of advanced developed states supported collection including text proposals by the eu and us a small number of states preferred to use both and a small number said they were agreeable to either as long as the definition was precise one state with substantial investment in advanced oceanographic research said they could not support any regulation or limitation of mgr access or collection which they argued would be inconsistent with unclos two developing states argued forcefully against this position with one saying that unclos was based on very limited knowledge should not be held sacred and cannot remain steady given the dynamic nature of the ocean the other developing state pointed out that unclos contains both the chm and freedom of the seas principles and the maximalist tendency towards freedom of the seas is the basic reason overexploitation has occurred and therefore not as golden as we present it412 notification vs permitting the modalities for regulating accesscollection are typically discussed as a notification or permitting scheme with the latter representing a more onerous requirement to seek out and receive approval before acquiring or utilizing mgrs from abnj 21 29 during igc2 developing country coalitions such as the pacific small island developing states psids favored a permit or license scheme as a means to ensure effective monitoring management and review  the basic difference in approaches was evidenced by the small number of text proposals submitted on article 12 despite the draft provision not being part of the official discussion during igc4 the draft treaty article as well as a proposal by clam maintains a focus on ensuring that ipr does not restrict benefitsharing the proposals by the eu and uk take the opposite approach and include revisions that would shift towards ensuring that benefit sharing does not contradict or undermine the existing system of ipr these differences in emphasis seem slight but represent different directions for the benefit sharing provisions which can also be seen in the debate in article 7 about whether this section should promote or ensure benefit sharing of mgrs while the g77china coalition unequivocally support ensure developed countries are more likely to support the idea of promotion in the revised draft text for igc5 article 7 says promote three times and no longer uses the word ensure this suggests that the draft text on benefit sharing is evolving in the direction favored by developed states414 kicking the can down the road during igc4 there was a notable trend towards shifting important decisions to the cop especially as concerns benefit sharing at the stage of utilization or commercialization of mgrs this approach may make it easier to build consensus during the bbnj negotiations but creates a weighty and contentious agenda for the cop this model has been used in ocean governance before setting up the structure and framework for decisionmaking and access rights in the treaty but deciding the specific rules and modalities later would mimic the relationship between unclos and the international seabed authority which is just now formulating the rules for benefit sharing from mineral resources almost two decades after its establishment however many developing states are concerned about what delayed decisionmaking would mean for the actual prospect of benefit sharing one small developed country made a powerful statement about how kicking such important decisions to the cop would not actually make the negotiation process easier but rather extend that process into another forum the cop where meetings may not be as regular and focused on this issue compared to the bbnj process42 abmts including mpas we have been able to see directions that could lead to consensus because you have all engaged in a dynamic way responding to proposals and demonstrating the presidents favorite word   facilitator renée sauvéat the start of the abmtsmpas workstreamin the time elapsed since the igc3 the global community has moved towards a new post2020 global framework for biodiversity conservation under the un convention on biological diversity cbd aiming to protect 30 of the planet by 2030 known as the 3030 commitment this target adds some pressure to the bbnj abmts discussion with respect to establishing effective high seas mpas while the jurisdictional scope of the cbds provisions to protect biodiversity is limited to areas within national jurisdiction the cbd does have an influence on the wider oceans regime and it governs the behavior of its parties with respect to processes and activities undertaken in abnj related to biodiversity protection4 specific contributions from cbd processes include the creation of criteria for identifying sensitive areas involvement in regional workshops focused on mpa designation and establishment of global targets for biodiversity protection  on one hand regional processes can be especially efficient in terms of target development implementation adaptation followup and review 5 31 on the other hand the existence of multiple competent sectoral organizations suggests the need for a cooperative initiator to coordinate resolve conflicts and encourage action by existing bodies 43 environmental impact assessments our work has been extremely successful and thats why we have the longest text in the document now we have to sort out our differences  facilitator rene lefebvre at the beginning of the eia workstreamit became clear at igc4 that while there was much done on the topic of environmental impact assessments eias controversy remained on the best way to proceed various models were held up as potential blueprints for the bbnj eia guidelines most notably article 206 of unclos there were also vociferous discussions about when the need for an eia would be triggered with some favoring a single trigger that would result in an eia becoming necessary with others favoring a tiered approach that would take into account the needs of particularly vulnerable areas unlike other issue areas where ideological disagreements dominate the discussion and divide states the topic of eias is characterized by three main themes how and how much to rely on existing mechanisms who will be assigned what decisionmaking authorities and whether there should be special rights for adjacent states andor special procedures for vulnerable areas although the eia issue area does not tap into major ideological divisions that shape for example the mgrs discussion it does involve fundamental questions about what it means to be an implementing agreement of unclos431 triggers and standards in terms of the design and implementation of the bbnj agreement the first major question is when and how an eia should be conducted each of these points were the subject of heated debate at igc4 the first when an eia should occur generally featured a discussion on potential triggers for an eia that is what criteria should be used to determine whether or when an eia was necessary most delegates agreed that the trigger if anything should be the level of potential impact and not the type of activity because of the should not undermine proviso in the mandate of the negotiations it is generally understood that activities with preexisting governance regimes such as fishing and seabed mining in the area would not be subject to new eia processes  among the countries that were interested in establishing an objective trigger for eias the question revolved around what that trigger should look like and whether there should be only one trigger or if a tiered approach of some kind was needed to account for special circumstances some of those who favored a single trigger pointed to unclos article 206 as a guideline this article reads when states have reasonable grounds for believing that planned activities under their jurisdiction or control may cause substantial pollution of or significant and harmful changes to the marine environment they shall as far as practicable assess the potential effects of such activities on the marine environment and shall communicate reports of the results of such assessments in the manner provided in article 205 this threshold of substantial pollution or significant and harmful changes does include subjective terms specifically the adjectives substantial and significant but it has the virtue of already being agreed to by most of the states participating in the bbnj negotiations some states however argued that this standard is too low and does not reflect more modern approaches to environmental protection these states often point to an alternative in the antarctic treaty systems madrid protocol which offers both a stricter standard and a tiered approach to the trigger for eiasarticle 8environmental impact assessment 1 proposed activities referred to in paragraph 2 below shall be subject to the procedures set out in annex i for prior assessment of the impacts of those activities on the antarctic environment or on dependent or associated ecosystems according to whether those activities are identified as having a less than a minor or transitory impactb a minor or transitory impact or c more than a minor or transitory impact the countries arguing for a single trigger suggest that eias are only needed when major impacts were expected an approach justified by the desire to avoid unnecessary delays in proposed activities as well as a fear of overwhelming any bureaucratic process set up to handle the eias those who advocate for the tiered approach argued that activities likely to have a minor or transitory impact would be subject only to a screening and those with more than a minor or transitory impact should be subject to a full eia these parties believed such an approach to be a valid compromise for all parties as one could avoid bureaucratic backlogs but also improve environmental protection there was also debate over whether particularly vulnerable areas needed extra eia guidelines or whether these areas should be considered on a case by case basis altogether an eia process with two stages two different thresholds and special consideration for certain areas would be significantly more complicated to implement compared to a statedetermined process that relies on the existing unclos threshold432 role of the scientific and technical body this led into a discussion about the scientifictechnical body stb and what its role would be with regard to eias some delegates indicated a preference for the stb to define relevant triggers and standards for eias others strongly preferred a statebased approach there were also a number of moderate positions that would assign the stb a limited advisory function regarding eitherboth definitions and determinations of eias there is general agreement among participating delegates that an stb serves a role in providing guidance for eias but several delegates feared that any role beyond recommendations would undermine existing regional bodies and instruments these arguments were forwarded by developed states such as the eu japan and the us in the explanations attached to their written proposals opposition to assigning a decisionmaking function to an stb on eias stemmed from a wariness that the body might affect the commercial prospects of a given state or private actor on the other hand several developing states were open to a more decisive role for the stb if it included regional representationthose who opposed stb decisionmaking sometimes proposed assigning such functions to the cop to avoid the lowest common denominator effect of allowing states to make all eia decisions several different approaches were proposed by delegates some of which are compatible with the idea of the stb retaining a degree of authority some delegates were comfortable with stb decisions advised by the cop while others preferred the other way around cop decisions with stb advice others emphasized that cop guidance should support stateled decisionmaking on eias all of these dividing lines predate igc4  as such the issue of cbtmt is not only important to strengthen the resilience and security of vulnerable states but support their activities in terms of the planning evaluation implementation and followup of other areas of the bbnj package15 16 for these reasons the developing states have been able to credibly argue that strong cbtmt provisions are critical to an effective treaty441 mandatory versus voluntary cbtmt has been the most stagnant area of negotiations in that there has been very little movement towards consensus since igc1 36 united nations general assembly 2017 resolution adopted by the general assembly on 24 december 2017 72249 httpundocsorgenares7224937 vadrot alice bm arne langlet ina
