kmeinkemlivecomminneapolis  up is down black is white and hell has frozen over in the minnesota winterthe detroit lions are division champslets say that one more time the detroit lions are division champsthe lions knocked off the minnesota vikings 3024 on sunday at us bank stadium securing their first nfc north crown since the north became a thing in 2002 even the tampa bay buccaneers had won their division more recently and the bucs havent been in their division in 20 yearsthey hadnt won a division title of any kind since taking the old nfc central in 1993 a 30year drought that was the longest in the league they finished last in 12 of those seasons since nearly as many as the rest of their division combinedonly three players on the 53man roster  guard graham glasgow long snapper jake mcquaide and backup quarterback teddy bridgewater  were even on the planet the last time this team won a titlethen along came dan campbell and brad holmesthe lions captured the imagination of the nation by winning eight of their final 10 games last season and dreamed big while cleaning out their lockers after the memorable finale in green baydivision champs thats obviously the goal star receiver amonra st brown said that day if youre division champs youre in the playoffs we want to make the playoffs we want to be division champsnow they areand they arethe lions improved 114 with the victory and have gone wiretowire to capture the north plus the home playoff game that comes with it they tentatively hold the no 2 seed on their side of the bracket pending whatever happens with dallas later in the day detroit finishes the season by traveling to dallas on saturday night for a primetime showcase that will have enormous seeding implications before wrapping up this historic campaign with another game against minnesota at ford fieldthe vikings 78 are also among the leading candidates to face detroit in the first round of the playoffs presenting a unique  and difficult  situation where the teams could square off three times in four weeksthe lions roared to a 3021 lead in the fourth quarter on long scoring drives that ended in a 1yard touchdown catch by amonra st brown and a 3yard touchdown run by jahmyr gibbs his second time finding the end zone on the day but the vikings never went away tacking on a field goal on offense before getting a huge stop on defense that gave minnesota the ball with a chance to take the lead in the final minutes of the fourth quarteredge rusher romeo okwara looked like he might have killed the lastminute threat when he rocked nick mullens for a sackfumble but johnson cominsky made a critical mistake when he failed to jump on the ball instead of trying to scoopandrun the lions only needed to acquire possession to win the game and when the ball bounced out of cominskys hands minnesota had another shot to take the division race to another weekgo ahead admit it thats the sort of blunder that has haunted the lions forever and if they lost this game with tough matchups against dallas and minnesota looming to end the season well things were starting to feel a little lionsyone play later mullens connected with justin jefferson on a 28yard pass that moved minnesota onto detroits side of the 50gulpbut this time the lions came through  and this time it came courtesy of ifeatu melifonwu who has been a revelation since cracking the lineup three weeks ago he sacked mullens twice earlier in the game then picked him off near the goal line in the final seconds to secure detroits first division title in 30 yearswith that the lions have officially gone wire to wire in a division they had never won and while they have two important games remaining for seeding purposes theyve already secured the first home playoff game in the history of ford fieldmission accomplishedlets get to some more observations now heres an interesting question when ceedy duce returns in the next week or two what if its not ifeatu melifonwu who goes to the bench like how can you possibly send that guy to the bench after what hes done in three weeks as a starter he had a sack that was nearly a sackfumble early last week against denver finished with two quarterback hits overall two passes defended plus delivered a careerhigh nine tackles that was a breakout performance and it didnt compare to his impact in minnesotamelifonwu finally ended the game by picking off nick mullens deep over the middle with 49 seconds left and minnesota on the move he also sacked mullens twice on blitzes one of which forced a fumble get this hes now the first defensive back in team history with multiple sacks in the same gamethere is a case to be made melifonwu is playing better than kerby joseph who has struggled to live up to his breakout rookie campaign from a year ago joseph was beaten deep twice on the first drive against minnesota setting up the vikings first score he did pick off mullens twice later in the game including on a desperation heave on thirdandlong in the fourth quarter but was also flagged for a ridiculous unnecessary roughness when he lit up justin jefferson on a secondandlong bomb late in the fourth quarter he plays reckless and his performance has been uneven all season dont be surprised if you see the lions at least consider finding a way to keep melifonwu on the field when duce returns to the lineup which should happen very soon in the biggest moments of the higheststakes game of the season amonra st brown shined most like youd expect anything else the former fourthround pick has smashed record books in his three years in detroit and just added another 12 catches for 106 yards and one goahead touchdown that pushes him across the 100catch mark for the second time in his threeyear career  something only one other player has managed in an entire career in franchise history and that player wasnt even calvin johnson but herman moorebut st brown is way more than just a stat stuffer hes at his most lethal in key situations particularly on third down and when the lions suddenly found themselves trailing in the third quarter st brown racked up five catches for 53 yards in that frame alone one scored a goahead touchdown while another went for 24 yards on third down moving the chains on a drive that wound up going 14 plays and finished with another jahmyr gibbs touchdown run that extended detroits lead to 3021 and gave them just enough cushion to hang on the lions insisted the tj hockenson trade was in the best interest of the organization and they would have pulled the trigger even if they would have been 51 instead of 15 at last years trade deadline boy were they right hockenson has played really good ball in minnesota racking up the most catches by any tight end in the league and the most yards of anyone not named travis kelce but they also replaced him by spending a secondround pick on sam laporta who has gone on to become the most productive rookie tight end in franchise history he added another three catches against minnesota bringing his season total to 74 second among all rookie tight ends in nfl history keith jackson holds the alltime record at 81given what they would have had to pay hockenson to keep him in detroit  and the cheap rookie contract that now controls laporta for the three years beyond this one  that trade is looking like another home run by brad holmes speaking of homerun trades by holmes laporta was acquired with the pick detroit added in the trade back in the first round of this years draft a trade that also net them jahmyr gibbs at 12th overall who is now rolling toward the finish line as one of the most explosive running backs in the league he added a leaguehigh 11th run of 20 yards against minnesota finished with 100 yards from scrimmage overall and scored twice one of which extended the lead to 3021 with 1107 left of course gibbs also had a fumble in the first half he might not be perfect but week in and week out hes pretty damn good these days gibbs now has 13 games with 50 yards from scrimmage this season tied for third most by any rookie in franchise historydetroit rookies now account for 20 touchdowns overall a new franchise record that had been shared by the rookie classes in 1989 which was headlined by barry sanders and 1980 which was led by billy sims not to be the bearer of bad news but michael badgleys second game as the lions new kicker was a bit shaky he split the uprights on a 37yard field goal but knuckled in a pointafter try and had another blocked he remains on the practice squad and has one elevation left detroits kicker situation remains a situation to monitor heading into the postseason brian branch is one of the best rookie defensive backs in the league but he opened this pivotal game by making two crushing mistakes on backtoback plays first getting flagged for defensive holding in the end zone on a thirddown stop to open the game then dropping a nick mullens pass that hit him in both hands on the very next play but branch atoned for his mistakes well picking off a fourthdown pass later in the half separating mullens from the football on a crushing sackfumble on the very next drive plus breaking up a pass for kj osborn on the final drive of the gamelatest detroit lions newssee what celebrities showed up for detroit lions big playoff winjared goff is the coldblooded killer

threw three interceptions for the first time since those very dark final days with the los angeles rams he threw two more balls into the hands of chicago defenders that were droppedthis was his worst game since in two years it could have been so much worsebut he didnt flinch and delivered when it mattered mostwith the lions facing a 12point deficit in the final 4 minutes goff heaved a 32yard touchdown bomb to jameson williams that drew detroit within one score then was nearperfect on an 11play drive that led the lions to chicagos 1yard line with 26 seconds leftto get that final yard the lions sent david montgomery onto the field to hammer the final nail into his old teams coffin and thats exactly what he did barrelling into the end zone for a touchdown that sent detroit to a wild 3126 win on sunday against the bearsthe lions improve to 82 for the first time since 1962 and just the fourth time in franchise history they are now a halfgame behind philadelphia 81 for the top spot in the nfc pending whatever the eagles do against kansas city 72 in a super bowl rematch on monday night footballthey now lead the nfc north by two games over the minnesota vikings 64 who face the broncos in denver tonight on sunday night football detroit has won seven straight games over the division overall a franchise record and will look to make it eight straight when it hosts the green bay packers in four days on thanksgivingbut man it was not easythe bears are one of the worst teams in the league but the lions played one of their worst games of the season against them goff opened the game with backtoback interceptions added another as the lions fell behind by double digits in the third quarter and could have two more that were droppedwill harris was flagged for pass interference in the end zone leading to a touchdown brian branch was flagged twice on thirddown stops one of which came on thirdand15 and led to a field goal kerby joseph blew a tackle on thirdand12 leading to another field goalthe lions still managed to take a 1410 halftime lead on a touchdown pass to amonra st brown just 11 seconds before intermission but gave away the momentum immediately coming out of the break they went threeandout on offense allowed a field goal on defense then craig reynolds fumbled the ensuing kickoff justin fields turned that into a 39yard touchdown pass to dj moore getting behind jerry jacobs and the lions trailed againthe game continued to spiral out of control as goff threw a third pick on a tipped pass and suddenly a fourpoint lead turned into a 12point deficit and fans that have serenaded this team from coast to coast were booing the quarterback and playcalls then the quarterback responded throwing a 32yard bomb to jameson williams that drew detroit within 2621 with 306 left then the defense joined in forcing a threeandout by stuffing two runs and defending a bomb down the field goff retook the field in a fivepoint game and was sublime he couldnt connected with williams on another deep shot then completed five of his next six passes to lead detroit all the way to the 1yard line montgomery chipped in four touches for 44 yards along the way and then reported back into the game once detroit was at the goal line and the former bears back  who left chicago because he was sick with the losing  hammered in the goahead score in a frenetic ford fieldyes players are coming to detroit now when theyre sick of losingand these days theyre winning more often than ever since 1962 lets get to some more observations what happened to you jared goff hes been one of the best quarterbacks in the league this season and one of the best quarterbacks at protecting the football making the fourthfewest turnoverworthy plays heading into the weekend on sunday he threw backtoback picks to open the game added another in the third quarter and had a fourth dropped that could have gone for six points the other way this is the first time goff has thrown multiple picks since oct 23 of last year and the first time hes thrown three picks since sept 29 2019 while he was still with the rams hes just been so good at tightening up after picks and had a nice little run of touchdown drives going after picks this season but the giveaways piled up against chicago and were the difference as the bears pulled ahead 2014 in the third quarterof course tip your cap to goffs steeliness under pressure in the final minutes he had played his worst game in years and still delivered backtoback touchdown drives in the final minutes to come all the way back for the win thats good stuff from one of the leagues best quarterbacks and make no mistake hes the face and voice of that locker room hes been through a lot and went through a lot on sunday and persevered through it all after montgomery plowed into the end zone for a 2926 lead in the final seconds aidan hutchinson sealed the dramatic win by taking down justin fields for a sackstrip the ball bounded through the back of the end zone for good measure adding two points on the safety craig reynolds also lost a fumble in the third quarter giving chicago a second straight possession coming out of the break the bears had already scored a field goal to draw within 1413 and then added a 39yard touchdown pass to dj moore to extend it to 2014adding injury to insult reynolds suffered an injury on the play and did not return hes the no 3 running back on the team and a trusted agent for dan campbell and ben johnson the lions are in good shape with david montgomery and jahmyr gibbs at running back but losing reynolds for any length of time is a blow to the depth at that position and as the injuries to montgomery and gibbs have shown depth is required at that position something to watch as the packers loom in just four days on thanksgiving one guy who didnt struggle was brian branch who might have played his best game since suffering the ankle injury that sidelined him a couple weeks in the first half of the season branch dropped running backs donta foreman and khalil herbert for 6yard losses apiece plus fields for a 2yard loss branch now has three games with three tackles for loss something no rookie defensive back had done even twice since 1999those thirddown penalties were backbreakers though extending drives that had been stopped both of which led to points branch is one of the best young cornerbacks in the league but those mistakes have to be cleaned up  shoutout to jameson williams who might have put together his best game as a passcatcher thats not saying much of course but both of his catches were monsters with detroit still trailing in the first half williams caught a 12yard pass over the middle on third down goff turned that into a touchdown pass to amonra st brown with just 11 seconds left before the break and what proved to be detroits only lead but with the lions trailing 2614 in the fourth quarter williams gave detroit another shot by getting behind the defense for a 32yard touchdown suddenly the lions found themselves in a onescore game despite the turnovers running back jahmyr gibbs ran for 36 yards and one touchdown extending his streak of games with a touchdown run to four that ties for the longest streak by a lions rookie ever matching kevin jones 2004 and barry sanders 1989 against his old team montgomery finished with 76 yards and the winning score rookie offensive lineman colby sorsdal started for the injured jonah jackson at left guard his most noteworthy play was a firstdown holding penalty that backed detroit behind the sticks and led to goffs second interception of the day the lions breakout season has made them a destination for alist celebrities this season including legendary rapper eminem nba star devin booker and
