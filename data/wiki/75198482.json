It is an in-name-only remake of the 1986 film A Better Tomorrow featuring different characters and a different story.\n\nPlot\nTriad member Tong Chun and his gang attack rival triad boss Black Ox in a movie theater, but Black Ox uses his girlfriend as a human shield and escapes. Outside he his shot three times by Big Lobster, who brags of his feat to Tong Chun but is shot in the back by Black Ox. Tong Chun fires the fatal shot at Black Ox and takes Big Lobster to the hospital, where the police demand his help with an ongoing case. At a meeting with the police the next day, he learns that the Hong Kong police are working with the FBI to frame him as drug dealer in an attempt to rid Hong Kong of undesirables before its upcoming handover to China. Lobster Tsui recovers in the hospital but returns home to find that his wife has locked his daughter Little Lobster in a cage with the dog and is sleeping with Bill, another triad member. During a fight, Bill accidentally kills Big Lobster's wife before being pushed out a window to his death by Big Lobster. The police charge Big Lobster with the murder of his wife, but Tong Chun enlists the aid of Barrister Wong, who capably defends Big Lobster at trial and obtains his release.\n\nBlack Ox's men attack their rivals in a restaurant, but Tong Chun and Big Lobster kill them off and manage to survive as well as save the injured Lui Wei. Back at his headquarters, Tong Chun is arrested over a significant amount of drugs that have been planted there. Lui Wei sends Holland Boy, who kills several officers while helping Tong Chun escape, angering Tong Chun, who feels this makes him look guilty. Lui Wei sends Tong Chun and Chiu to hide out in Mainland China, where Holland Boy kills Chiu and attempts to kill Tong Chun on Lui Wei's orders to cover up for Lui Wei's own drug smuggling activities. Tong Chun survives and escapes to Vietnam after sending Chili a message that Lui Wei has betrayed them. Chili attempts to kill Lui Wei herself, but is caught and disfigured by Holland Boy.\n\nTwo years later, Tong Chun has returned to Hong Kong without any ID and is working as a cook. His boss Fred Simon's son Duke Simon is kidnapped for a ransom by thugs working for a triad named Panther, so Tong Chun and Fred seek help from Big Lobster, who has become a powerful triad member in the meantime. Big Lobster's men quickly rescue Duke and apprehend one thug who cut his ear, but Big Lobster follows his sworn older brother's advice and lets the man live. Tong Chun advises Big Lobster that Lui Wei has been helping him advance in the criminal underworld in order to later use him as a scapegoat for his drug dealings the way he did to Tong Chun, so Big Lobster confronts Lui Wei about the case Lui Wei is building against Big Lobster with the FBI and says that he is splitting up with Lui Wei. Tong Chun finds Chili, who has become a heroin addict due to the pain she still feels from her time being tortured by Holland Boy. Big Lobster's place is raided by the police on a tip from Duke, who is secretly an undercover cop, but they do not find what they are looking for. Big Lobster's place is then raided by Holland Boy and his men, who kill Big Lobster as well as his daughter Little Lobster in front of Duke.\n\nAt the police station, Lui Wei tells the police that he wasn't there at the time of the murders, and Barrister Wong throws coffee on him instead of helping him. Lui Wei goes into the restroom to clean up, where Tong Chun shoots him. The police handcuff Tong Chung, and Lui Wei reveals that he was wearing a bulletproof vest, then leaves laughing. Duke arrives and has his weapon stolen by Tong Chung, who escapes by holding Duke at gunpoint. Tong Chung pursues Lui Wei and ultimately kills him with the help of Duke.\n\nCast\n\nLau Ching-wan as \"Big Lobster\" Tsui\nCheng Yee-kin as Tong Chun\nWong Man-tak as Duke Simon\nYau Suk-ching as Chili\nLam Kwok-bun as Lui Wei\nNgai Sing as Holland Boy\nJim Wong as Barrister Wong\nPui Chun as Fred Simon\nWong Pak-man as Detective But\nChan Chi-fai as Bill Tung\nLeung Pui-chi as Ting Tong\nChing Tung as Chiu\nLo Meng as Black Ox\nFung Chung-yee as Little Lobster\nGary Mak as Uncle No. 5\nYip Choi-nam as Assassin\n\nRelease\nThe film ran in Hong Kong theaters from July 14 to July 27, 1994.\n\nReception\nReviewer Joseph Kuby of cityonfire.com gave the film a rating of 9/10, writing, \"This film is tragic, heart-felt, horrific and harrowing without being too sappy, schmaltzy or saccharine-saturated.

ben lam kwok bun james wong jim paul chun pui lee siukei lo meng collin chou ernest mauser running time 104 min by joseph kuby underrated heroic bloodshed gem return to a better tomorrow is usually looked down upon just because its directed by wong jing who receives some fairly biased reviews and is an extremely underrated director  hes actually one of the best of all time but its actually one of the best films to come from the heroic bloodshed genre a genre kickstarted by john woo but the term however was coined by rick baker meaning films which contain violence and heroic pathos im not sure what the critical reaction was in hong kong but the failure of the film cemented the fact that the heroic bloodshed had seen its last day kind of like what ratts 1990 album detonator did to pop metal and it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for this unique genre of film or really a subgenreamalgamation of the action and gangster genres return to a better tomorrow was made for two reasons of course wong jing wanted to see how much mileage the heroic bloodshed still had left to cover both artistically and commercially whilst the film flopped at the local box office it still showed that wong can direct drama if he wants toand direct it well may i add but the film proved to be influential in terms of how seriously the critics took ekin cheng as an actor also the film proved to be influential in not only establishing and succeeding at launching ekin cheng as a fullfledged action icon ala heath ledger or better yet ryan reynolds but it showed audiences that he could play a convincing triad chinese mafia gang leader which was vital for the success of andrew laus young  dangerous films whose first installment was made two years after rtabt im assuming jings gangster thriller must have had some cult following afterwards because really ekin was notably seen as pop singer first and actor second so the idea of seeing ekin play a tough heavy was akin to seeing justin timberlake play tony montana in a remake of scarface speaking of remakes this film is sort of like a remake to a better tomorrow but because its directed by wong jing its automatically referred to by hauteur critics as a ripoff for those who havent caught on  its not a sequel while the film does bear some similarities to woos seminal masterpiece jings film is in a league of its own which deserves to be looked at in its own arena rather than looked down upon and on its own terms in the same way john woos bullet in the head shouldnt be quickly written off as a deer hunter ripoff coincidentally rtabt shares a similar plotpoint to bith in regards to one of the main characters taking heroin after going throw a harrowing experience only to be rescued by two past friends which brings us to the second reason why wong jing decided to helm this film john had referenced god of gamblers in a brief tongueincheek homage for his breezy yet bright as in smart not just in the perky sense action caper once a thief so wong wanted to throw a friendly yet featurelength nod to woos legacy this was done between john woo and quentin tarantino as quentin had his gangsters in reservoir dogs look like the ones in a better tomorrow 2 so john had payed back the favour with the earcutting scene in hard target as a referential florid gesture towards the similar scene in quentins debut film this game of exchanging injokes can be played even further as wong jing referenced reservoir dogs in high risk starring jet li from lethal weapon 4 and unleashed fame and referenced pulp fiction in his comedy classic sixty million dollar man starring stephen chow of shaolin soccer and kung fu hustle fame so now it seems that its quentins turn to reference wong jing return to a better tomorrow plays on the familiar themes of the heroic bloodshed genre loyalty male bonding friendship honour betrayal high calibre shootouts revenge redemption and sacrifice rather than just simply retreading wellworn themes wong looks at each facet carefully and tries to decipher new elements of which can be added and ones which can be given a fresh spin for instance usually the female character in one of these films is a very passive and sexually repressed person whereas chingmy yaus character is a very feisty individual with a strong sense of sexuality the acting is solid all round with performances that may not be oscarworthy but certainly not bottomofthebarrel either the villains in particular are rather seedy scathing sleazy scornful yet memorable you really want them to get some form of comeuppance the action sequences here are very well done the scope and scale of the story doesnt and isnt meant to allow for the epic action sequences seen in hard boiled as this is a crime thriller than an allout action film which merely alludes to the insandouts of the crime world and the usual daytoday business of that sordid kind of employment therefore its best not to expect an allout action affair though the action setpieces are smartly handled with skillful precision and care if theres anything which should be immediately apparent about wong jing is that hes certainly one of the worlds best action directors as his ideas vision and the way he puts it on the screen is simply a marvel to behold he sure knows how to stage an action sequence he sets the stage and plays up the mood nicely especially during the hotel action sequence wong even tries to oneup john by having ekin using dual shotguns instead of dual pistols and theres one particular sequence involving powerful revolvers and a lorry which really is the cherry on the cake even on the basis of action sequences alone wong jing could never be seen as a bad or terrible director theres far more worse directors out there action or otherwise not just ones who are plain outright bad but ones who maybe be okay or good but just not as good as wong jing yep there is worse this film is tragic heartfelt horrific and harrowing without being too sappy schmaltzy or saccharinesaturated the melodrama isnt as heavyhanded as john woos original which is the one thing which gives jing more of an advantage and the action has just as much bite but most importantly with this being a crime thriller no feelings are spared no punches are pulled and there are no compromises  something which reflects the true nature of the world of crime not everyone in life has a happy ending and wong jing certainly makes sure of that here it may not please people who want and expect things to be sanitized politically correct with a happy hollywood ending and an overall glamourized feel thematically not just stylistically but then it would be a copout to the realistic nature of the subject matter the truth is it pays to be a criminal simply put there is no way out no matter which side you are on thus its pretty much like war very few filmmakers would have the courage to show the death of a child on screen whilst its not done as graphically as john carpenter in the original assault on precinct 13 the subtlety of the way wong jing handles it shows an interestingly artistic and poignant side to him but at the same time revealing that hes someone with quite a lot of nerve verve and audacity a very derringdodaredevil mentality which is very common throughout jings repertoire albeit with much detriment to the critics the violence in this film is very offputting maybe not as gutwrenchingly realistic as something you may see elsewhere like full contact but certainly unsettling and uncomfortable hard boiled it isnt the film astonishingly was cut in hong kong because of the x rated material probably either due to language nudity and violence so the fact that the film still manages to shock is saying something about the original versions extremely explosive content in this version people are pulverized and though its not exactly as grotesque as something seen in raging bull or rocky the results are disturbingly close so who knows what the original was like though wong jing has shown far more sinister acts of violences such as the torture scene in the big score and the fetus removal scene though we dont see it actually happening in god of gamblers 4 the return its alluded to that chingmys character goes through abuse by men in this film and with this being a wong jing film it wouldnt be a surprise if it was sexual violence of a highly explicit nature in some ways its easy to see where the cuts were made also if you look at the trailer some dialogue scenes were trimmed as well  taking away some of the films depth and emotional punch just for the sake of delivering some trivia these are some of the many others dialogue scenes removed from the film 1 a conversation between michael wong and ekin cheng 2 an argument between parkman wong and his superior 3 scenes from chengs childhood ie his first killing as a child in one of the films death scenes wong jing utilizes a technique that was used by chang cheh john woos mentor and main source of influence but not by john woo himself which proves that wong jing is as driven with initiative as he is with influence this technique of chang chehs is one that was used to good effect in the men from the monastery  basically when one of the heroes dies the colour of the screen changes into a single colour or monochrome wong jing even borrows a technique much used by ringo lam and wong kar wai in their movies in which the camera is very shaky think blurovision during an action sequence admittedly something which even some of tsui harks directorial status had done this as well when he made the blade not that its a bad thing it just depends on the way its done and if credit is given something wong was never adamant to mention in fact the reason why ive given this a 9 than a 10 is a bad acting turn by michael wong and slightly misguided directing on wong jings behalf when mikes character goes berserk over the death of one of the main characters before dissolving into a cheesy fight sequence with a typical action movie score which derails the film in a way which the car chase sequence in bullet in the head had almost derailed that particular film wong jing may be considered a hack by most but people who carefully analyze his filmography with analretentive precision and go through an extreme multitude of others will come to realize he is anything but wong jing is someone whos capable at the very best at making classic films even masterpieces which can mix genres and obtain both artistic  commercial success the fact that his most highestgrossing film god of gamblers 4 the return aka the return of the god of gamblers was one that was said to be critically acclaimed according to the authors of the essential jackie chan sourcebook is a testament to this besides all filmmakers go through bad patches in terms of quality and quantity its just its obvious with some directors than it is with most if i had to find a nonchinese directorial comparison with wong jing it wouldnt be roger corman and certainly not john waters i feel wong is the chinese equivalent to john carpenter  both have proven to be very daring even groundbreaking directors who have done practically almost every subgenre in their genres of choice horror for carpenter and action for wong just like john jing has gone through a bit of a rough patch recently  churning out films that are average and no real indicator of his true talent but take my word for it wong jing is one of the most creative filmmakers around and surely without a doubt one of the best filmmakers of all time he may not be as brilliant as orson welles steven spielberg george lucas martin scorsese and tsui hark but wong at his best when given the right push money and time is a great director  uk based film fanhong kong movie club owner  this is an applicable comparison because the one thing ratts album and wong jings film have in common is that both are classics of the genre but timing meant that commercial success fell short of expectations had both been released earlier on they would have received their dues commercially and critically  coincidentally produced by wong jing joseph kubys rating 910 by ben poppel this movie was a very interesting to say the least it had the better tomorrow title slapped on it to sell more tickets while there were some surprisingly good shootouts in the film i still dont think it quite lived up to the name and what is up with all the slow mo in the film i just dont understand why directors think they have to slow the movie down during dramatic fight scenes it rarely ever works to any advantage while the cover art for the film was good it was kind of false advertising because it showed michael wong on the front and he didnt show up till almost an hour into the film that is alright he didnt need to be in the film anymore than that anyways ok enough about bashing the film  despite some minor flaws this was actually a pretty good movie for the most part the two main characters ekin cheng and the almost always flawless lau ching wan were superb in their kind of reversal of power roles they established throughout the film i was really surprised by ekins acting  it was pretty good almost better than his young and dangerous roles chingmay yaus part in the film was also fairly good but kind of left us wanting her to go away towards the latter half of the movie as she turned into a drug addict the cute little girl who was the daughter had some very memorable and shocking scenes in the movie what got me was how everything molded together  story characters setting action and triad themes to make for an above average hk production this movie wont be on many top ten lists or become a movie to watch over and over but it is a pretty fun ride the first time through if you want to watch this movie ignore the title and dont expect much then you may find it entertaining  otherwise you may just think of it as a bunch of wong jing crap good but not great ben poppels rating 710 this entry was posted in chinese golden harvest news reviews and tagged chingmy yau colin chou ekin cheng

jing reviewed by andrew skeatesapr52017 cast  crew despite the tantalising title this flick has nothing to do with john woos genre defining classics but is rather a cheap cash in from the relentless wong jing conveyor belt return to a better tomorrow rtabt tries to emulate the themes and stylish action of woos a better tomorrow films but despite a couple of lively action beats and one or two decent performances its just a case of seen it all before and seen it done better ekin cheng is big shot triad badass chun who has hundreds of loyal followers a hot finance chingmy yau and seemingly all of hong kong at his feet chun plans to leave this life behind but his controlling boss has other ideas framing chun for some major drug smuggling fleeing into hiding on mainland china with what he believes to be allies he is soon double crossed again when they attempt to take his life going into hiding on his own for several years chun waits to return to settle the score rescue his finance who has fallen on hard times and team up with a former follower now a big shot triad in his own right lobster lau chingwan to take revenge rtabt certainly has all the right ingredients to be a slick and snazzy slice of heroic bloodshed lots of gunplay lots of talk of honour lots of cool posing but unfortunately doesnt quite mix into a tasty whole while kicking off in violent style with some 90s style slomo action and a couple of decent gunfights proceedings soon turn turgid as lobsters backstory takes precedence crappy wife lovable kid he wants to rise the ranks of chuns posse meaning dull drama takes over in fact come the third act jing seems to throw in every type of drama he can think of in order to give the film some grit so we get family strife drug addiction broken relationships cancer and in one of the more extreme moments child killing mixed with all the gunplay action and the justcanthelphimself bit of wong jing comedyslapstick shenanigans rtabt is a bit of a hodgepodge of well everything still while it doesnt all cohere into a satisfying whole there are some entertaining bursts to be found in this low rent mid90s guns and gangsters tale there is some style to the photography courtesy of cheng siukeung lau chingwan full alert gives a lively performance though appears to be in a different film to everyone else likewise collin chou flashpoint is great fun as the completely deranged platinum haired oddly named assassin holland boy and should have had more screentime and jing does manage to orchestrate a couple of full blast gunfights one in a restaurant another in a hotel before going into bonkers action overkill for the finale not as exhilarating as it should be but entertaining in fits and starts the genre certainly produced a lot better during this era but if one is a fan of wong jings assembly line rip offs then give it a whirl author recent posts follow meandrew skeatesto tell you the truth i dont think this is a brains kind of operation
