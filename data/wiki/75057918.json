According to the UN, the Israeli military gave a 24 hour deadline for the evacuation, while an Israeli military spokesperson did not specify a deadline and said the IDF understood an evacuation would \"take time\". The order came one week after a surprise offensive on Israel from Gaza was mounted by Hamas. By 14 October, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians evacuated northern Gaza. Palestinians have described the depopulation of northern Gaza as the \"second Nakba.\"\n\nPaula Gaviria Betancur, UN special rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, condemned the forcible evacuation order as a \"crime against humanity and a blatant violation of international humanitarian law.\"\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called on Palestinians to leave the northern part of Gaza, including Gaza City, saying: \"The camouflage of the terrorists is the civil population. Therefore, we need to separate them. So those who want to save their life, please go south.\"\n\nBackground\nTensions escalated when Hamas launched an offensive on Israel. Israel responded with a series of airstrike attacks on Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) issued a warning to residents in the northern regions to evacuate. The United Nations initially considered this evacuation order impractical to execute safely due to the significant number of people it affected.\n\nResponses\n\nUN response \nIn a statement, the UN  warned of \"devastating humanitarian consequences\" of displacing 1.1 million Palestinians. Shortly after the evacuation orders were issued, UN facilities, including UNRWA, were instructed to move to Rafah.\n\nHamas response\nHamas officials rejected the warning and urged those in affected areas to ignore the order and stay in their homes. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs told residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and to stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation.\"\n\nInternational organizations\nDoctors Without Borders issued a statement calling the order to evacuate \"outrageous\" and \"an attack on medical care and on humanity\" and condemned the Israeli order \"in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nThe World Health Organisation released a plea \"appealing to Israel to immediately rescind orders for the evacuation of over 1 million people living north of Wadi Gaza\" arguing that its extremely difficult to move patients in critical care, medical supplies are depleting and that \"the four Ministry of Health hospitals in south Gaza are already beyond capacity\". Similar statements were issued by UNICEF and IRC. The WHO expressed concern about the evacuation order sent to the al-Quds Hospital in Gaza.\n\nAccusations of war crime and Israeli humanitarian claims\n\nIsrael's evacuation order was characterized as a forcible population transfer by Jan Egeland, the Norwegian former diplomat involved with the Oslo Accord. A \"forcible transfer\" is the forced relocation  of a civilian population as part of an organized offense against it and is considered a crime against humanity by the International Criminal Court. In an interview with the BBC, Egeland stated, \"There are hundreds of thousands of people fleeing for their life — [that is] not something that should be called an evacuation. It is a forcible transfer of people from all of northern Gaza, which according to the Geneva Convention is a war crime.\" UN Special rapporteur Francesca Albanese warned of a mass ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Raz Segal, an Israeli historian and director of the Holocaust and Genocide Studies program at Stockton University, termed it a \"textbook case of genocide.\"\n\nOn 13 October 2023, a draft document prepared by Israel's Ministry of Intelligence proposed moving 2.3 million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Egypt's Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe call for north Gaza residents to head south of the battle zone was characterized by a former Israeli officer as a \"Humanitarian Exodus\" to save as many lives as possible. On October 15, Israel's chief military spokesman accused Hamas of trying to use civilians as human shields and issued a new appeal to Gaza residents to move south of the battle zone.\n\nAn IDF officer told the New York Times that instead of the \"roof knocking\" policy, Israel is issuing mass evacuation orders and leaflets stating that \"anyone who is near Hamas fighters will put their lives in danger.\"\n\nOn 21 October 2023, the Israeli army dropped more leaflets in Gaza with the message: \"Urgent warning! To the residents of Gaza: your presence to the North of Wadi Gaza is putting your lives at risk. Anyone who chooses not to evacuate from the North of the Gaza Strip to the South of the Gaza Strip may be identified as a partner in a terrorist organization.\"\n\nAttempts of blocking Palestinian evacuation\n\nAttacks\nOn 13 October 2023, multiple bombings targeted Palestinians attempting to leave northern Gaza City killing 70 people, mostly women and children as coinciding with an evacuation directive from Israel, urging more than a million residents from northern Gaza to move to the southern part of the territory; and 200 people were injured. Hamas issued a statement accusing Israel for bombing civilians. In return, Israel directly accused Hamas of blocking Palestinian evacuation, in order to use them as \"human shields\". The party behind the bombings is still unknown due to the nature of the explosion.\n\nOn 30 October, Israeli tanks blocked the roads connecting Gaza City to southern Gaza and reportedly fired on civilian vehicles complying with Israeli orders to evacuate. In one instance, a tank at Netzarim attacked a car and a bus, killing three people.\n\nAgitation against leaving by Hamas\nOn October 13, Gaza mosques broadcast messages telling Gaza Strip residents to not evacuate. \n\nReportedly, the IDF said that as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians began moving south, many were getting stuck in traffic caused by roadblocks that Hamas set up on Saturday, October 14th.\n\nInternational efforts to open humanitarian corridor\nDespite international efforts to open a humanitarian corridor for civilians, there has been no success in reaching a deal. Egypt has been involved in discussions to provide humanitarian aid, but did not have any safe evacuation corridors set up as of October 11.\n\nSee also \nEvacuations during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war\n2023 Israeli ground operations in the Gaza Strip \nOctober 2023 Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip\nEvacuation in the Soviet Union \nEvacuation of East Prussia\nOutline of the 2023 Israel–Hamas war\n\nReferences\n\n2023 Israel–Hamas war\n2023 in the Gaza Strip\nEthnic cleansing in Asia\nHistory of the Gaza Strip\nSociety of the Gaza Strip", "unikey": "Gaza Strip evacuations", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Evacuation_of_northern_Gaza", "Attacks_on_evacuees", "Southern_Gaza", "Refugees", "Responses", "Accusations_of_war_crime", "Israeli_humanitarian_claims", "See_also", "Notes", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Tensions escalated whenHamaslaunched an offensive on Israel.

The hospital director had told Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor he had sent an appeal to aid groups about the children after being forced to evacuate and leave them behind by IDF forces.Two independent forensic pathologists reviewed the raw footage for NBC News saying that the advanced stages of decomposition of the dead infants is consistent with the roughly two weeks from the time the infants would have been abandoned to the date the video was shot.\n", "Both Hamas and the IDF accused each other of preventing the evacuation of Palestinians from northern Gaza.

the precise details of any such a deal however remain unclear five to six times a day im working on how i can be helpful in getting the hostages released and have a period of time where theres a pause long enough to let that happen he said a top administration official on middle east issues brett mcgurk is in the region this week and will be heavily engaged in the ongoing negotiations to get the hostages out a white house spokesperson said thursday israeli officials have refused comment on any potential deal hamas officials have signaled an openness to a deal to release hostages last month the group released four hostages  two americans and later two older israeli women about 240 hostages are thought to remain in captivity in gaza since they were kidnapped from israeli towns and kibbutzim across the border during the oct 7 hamas attack on israel that left 1200 people dead israels offensive into gaza in response to the attack has killed at least 11470 palestinians according to health officials in gaza us officials believe that several americans are among the captives including a 3yearold toddler hamas says israeli airstrikes have killed dozens of hostages middle east crisis  explained israelhezbollah fighting forces people in southern lebanon to flee violence  again on thursday the israel defense forces announced that soldiers had recovered the body of an israeli hostage from a structure adjacent to alshifa hospital the sprawling medical complex israeli forces entered early wednesday the hostage a 64yearold woman named yehudit weiss was kidnapped on oct 7 from beeri a small kibbutz near the gaza border the israeli military said her husband was killed in beeri that day israeli media reported weiss had been diagnosed with breast cancer about three months before the hamas attack her family members told israeli media earlier this month israels military did not provide any details about when or how weiss died israeli soldiers remain inside alshifa hospital the largest and most modern hospital in the gaza strip many patients and staff are still inside the hospital aid groups and health officials in gaza said but the hospital is now inaccessible to ambulances and patients for weeks israel has said hamas used the hospital and a network of tunnels underneath it to store weapons and plan attacks hamas denies those allegations a hamas spokesperson said that dozens of palestinians had died in alshifa over the past several days and that dozens more had been killed as they tried to flee the hospital israel claimed no casualties among the patients doctors and civilians at alshifa a telecommunications blackout is complicating aid efforts the renewed telecommunications blackout has kept palestinians from being able to call for ambulances reaching loved ones and has hampered aid efforts as the humanitarian situation remains desperate aid groups told npr we regret to announce that all telecom services in gaza strip have gone out of service as all energy sources sustaining the network have been depleted and fuel was not allowed in paltel the palestinian telecom company said in a statement doctors without borders said its communication capabilities were very limited middle east crisis  explained doctors are among the many dead in gaza these are their stories the blackout comes at a moment when hospitals across northern gaza have shuttered because they lack fuel for electricity and enough medical supplies and as they face israeli evacuation orders these situations impede humanitarian and medical personnel from working safely and effectively the international committee for the red cross said in a statement even the potentially lifesaving act of calling an ambulance becomes impossible it hampers the ability of rescue teams and first responders to reach the wounded and injured without communications the un also cannot bring assistance into gaza or distribute critical aid within gaza israeli military urges evacuation of parts of southern gaza the blackout came one day after israels military dropped leaflets over a part of southern gaza where many palestinians have sought shelter the flyers ordered civilians in areas east of khan younis which is in southern gaza to evacuate to known shelters this includes people in the towns of al qarara khuzaa bani suheila and abasan according to the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs the order was an indication that israel may be poised to expand its area of heavy operations beyond northern gaza hundreds of thousands of people from the north of gaza have already evacuated to areas in the south some injured or sick walking for hours with the few possessions they could carry and sometimes amid active gunfire and bombings with israeli troops

health and living conditions of civilians there last week the international rescue committee issued a warning about the high risks of the spread of deadly cholera and typhoid in gaza because most of the population has no access to safe and clean water the un and other aid groups have objected to israeli proposals to create a socalled safe zone in gaza a temporary area where displaced civilians could safely gather and receive aid in a statement released thursday the heads of 18 international agencies said they would not participate in the establishment of a safe zone in gaza without the agreement of all warring parties and other conditions in place to ensure safety no safe zone is truly safe when it is declared unilaterally or enforced by the presence of armed forces wrote the group which included the uns humanitarian chief martin griffiths its human rights chief volker türk and its high commissioner for refugees filippo grandi more than 15 million people in gaza are estimated to be internally displaced according to the un that includes about 813000 displaced people who are staying in at least 154 unrun shelters  a number far more than what the facilities are capable of

northern gaza during a threehour evacuation window it had set on saturday the hamas terrorist organization exploited the humanitarian window that the idf provided to residents of the gaza strip to move southwards and the terrorists fired mortars and antitank missiles at idf troops who arrived and operated to open the route the israel defense forces said in a statement earlier saturday the military announced there would be a brief threehour window starting 1 pm local time until 4 pm for people trapped in northern gaza to travel on the road to southern gaza safely the israeli military said it would avoid hitting a main road heading south but emphasized that this was in no way a ceasefire hundreds of thousands of people still stuck in northern gaza had three hours to flee south but it appears few people if any were able to leave by the end of this window an npr reporter in gaza had not encountered anyone able to use this socalled safe passage several drivers there shared that it was impossible for anyone to make it through on the damaged street one driver told npr that he and his brother were heading south and found that the roads were not passable that there are holes in the

ground operation its been about a week since israeli troops pushed into gaza through a ground offensive and remained in the strip this military effort has mostly been focused in the north and has effectively cut the strip in half preventing aid from getting in or civilians from getting out the palestinian death toll from israels response to the oct 7 hamas attack is now at 9488 people in gaza  nearly 70 of them being women and children according to the ministry of health if any civilians were able to flee to the south of gaza during the window they could likely move no further than that once they arrived officials in gaza also closed the one available border crossing from gaza into egypt on saturday they said foreign passport holders will not be allowed to leave gaza through the rafah border crossing into egypt unless patients from the hospitals in gaza city and northern gaza are permitted to get to the crossing the crossing has been opened the past three days for

fulltext search max remarks unicef executive director catherine russells remarks at the un security council briefing on the protection of children in gaza as delivered 22 november 2023 unicef new york november 22 2023  excellencies thank you to ambassador nusseibeh ambassador zhang jun and ambassador frazier for bringing us together to speak about the worsening situation for children in the state of palestine and israel i would also like to thank this council for its adoption of resolution 2712 a text that acknowledges the disproportionate impact of this war on children by demanding that parties to the conflict afford children with the special protection they are entitled to under international law critically this resolution calls for extended humanitarian pauses and corridors in gaza  which i hope will be urgently implemented so that humanitarian partners can reach civilians in need  especially children unicef also welcomes the limited ceasefire agreement we are positioned to quickly scale up the delivery of desperately needed humanitarian aid in gaza but of course more resources are needed to meet ever growing needs but this is far from enough the war must be brought to an end and the killing and maiming of children must stop immediately excellencies before briefing you in more detail on the situation in gaza i would like to draw your attention to the plight of children in israel and the west bank since october 7th 35 israeli children have reportedly been killed while more than 30 are being held hostage in gaza like the secretarygeneral has said the agreement to release hostages is welcomed but much more needs to be done unicef will continue to call on parties to safely release all abducted children last week unicefs deputy executive director traveled to israel where he met with families of the child hostages they shared their anguish and deepening fear over the safety of their children i had planned to travel to israel and the west bank last week as well but i was advised by doctors to postpone my visit after sustaining injuries in a car crash en route to rafah our deputy executive director visited the west bank to assess the deteriorating security and humanitarian conditions there over the past six weeks 56 palestinian children have been killed while scores have been displaced from their homes we estimate that 450000 children in the west bank need humanitarian assistance unicef and its partners are providing mental health and protection support water and sanitation services and remedial education for 280000 children in the west bank turning to gaza i have just returned from a visit to the south of the territory where i was able to meet with children their families and with unicef staff on the ground i am haunted by what i saw and heard when i visited the nasser hospital in khan yunis it was teeming with people in addition to the patients and medical staff the hospital is sheltering thousands of internally displaced people they are sleeping on blankets along corridors and in the hospitals common areas while i was there i spoke with a 16yearold girl lying in her hospital bed she was badly injured when her neighborhood was bombed and the doctors told her she will never walk again in the hospitals neonatal ward i saw tiny babies clinging to life in incubators as doctors worried how they could keep the machines running without fuel during my time in khan yunis i also spoke with a unicef staff member who despite losing 17 members of her own extended family is working heroically to provide children and families in gaza with access to safe water and sanitation as a mother of four she is one of countless parents in gaza in constant fear for her family given the terrible toll this war has exacted on gazas children their fear is well founded more than 5300 palestinian children have been reportedly killed in just 46 days  that is over 115 a day every day for weeks and weeks based on these figures children account for forty per cent of the deaths in gaza this is unprecedented in other words today the gaza strip is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child we are also receiving reports that more than 1200 children remain under the rubble of bombed out buildings or are otherwise unaccounted for of note the number of deaths in the present crisis has far surpassed the total number of deaths during previous escalations for comparison a total of 1653 children were verified as killed in 17 years of monitoring and reporting of grave violations between 2005 and 2022 children who manage to survive the war are likely to see their lives irrevocably altered through repeated exposure to traumatic events the violence and upheaval around them can induce toxic stress that interferes with their physical and cognitive development even before this latest escalation more than 540000 children in gaza  half of its entire child population  were identified as needing mental health and psychosocial support today well over 17 million people in gaza half of whom are children are displaced we are particularly concerned by reports of increasing numbers of displaced children who have been separated from their families along evacuation corridors to the south or who are otherwise arriving unaccompanied to hospitals for medical care these children are especially vulnerable and they urgently need to be identified provided with temporary care and given access to family tracing and reunification services in addition to bombs rockets and gunfire gazas children are at extreme risk from catastrophic living conditions one million children  or really all children inside the territory  are now food insecure facing what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis we project that over the next few months child wasting the most lifethreatening form of malnutrition in children could increase by nearly 30 per cent in gaza meanwhile water production capacity has plummeted to just five per cent of its normal output with families and children relying on three liters or less of water per person per day for drinking cooking and hygiene at the same time water pumping desalination and wastewater treatment have all ceased to function because of the lack of fuel and sanitation services have collapsed these conditions are leading to disease outbreaks which could be lifethreatening for vulnerable groups like newborns children and women  especially those who are malnourished we are seeing cases of diarrheal and respiratory infections in children under five we anticipate that the situation could worsen as the colder winter weather starts to set in the public health risks in gaza are compounded by the virtual shutdown of the health care system more than twothirds of hospitals are no longer functioning because of the lack of fuel and water or because they sustained catastrophic damage in attacks moreover who estimates that at least 16 health workers have been killed and 38 injured while on duty hospital patients are being injured and killed or are dying from the lack of medicine and care last week unicef was part of an interagency mission that relocated 31 babies from alshifa hospital to the emirati hospital in the south of the gaza strip twentyeight of those babies are now receiving care in egypt hospitals should never be attacked or used by combatants and with thousands of displaced people sheltering in gazas health facilities i cannot emphasize this point enough we are also seeing devastating attacks on schools with close to 90 per cent of all school buildings sustaining damage nearly 80 per cent of the remaining school facilities are being used as shelters for internally displaced people but even these spaces where children and families have sought safety after fleeing their homes have come under attack this past weekend strikes on two schools including unrwas alfakhura school which was sheltering displaced people reportedly killed at least 24 people unicef condemns all attacks on schools across the state of palestine and israel parties to the conflict are blatantly committing grave violations against children  including killing maiming abductions attacks on schools and hospitals and the denial of humanitarian access but in gaza the effects of the violence perpetrated on children have been catastrophic indiscriminate and disproportionate and when the war ends the contamination by explosive remnants of war will be unprecedented with potentially tens of thousands of remnants scattered across gaza and beyond  a lethal threat to children that could last for decades inside gaza the war has also caused the largest ever loss of life for un personnel with more than 100 unrwa staff killed and in recent days a who colleague was killed along with her 6monthold baby her husband and her two brothers excellencies for children to survive for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver humanitarian pauses are simply not enough unicef is calling for an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage we are concerned that further military escalation in the south of gaza would exponentially worsen the humanitarian situation there causing additional displacement and squeezing the civilian population into an even smaller area attacks on the south must be avoided unicef is strongly opposed to the establishment of socalled safe zones no place is safe in the gaza strip and the proposed zones do not have the infrastructure or protection measures in place to meet the needs of such large numbers of civilians we also reiterate our call on the parties to immediately and fully respect international humanitarian and human rights law including the principles of necessity distinction precaution and proportionality we ask them to go beyond what the law requires  to protect children and the civilian infrastructure they rely on and to immediately and unconditionally release all civilian hostages held in the gaza strip especially children we call on the parties to abide by resolution 2712 and to provide safe and unrestricted humanitarian access to and within the gaza strip including in the north parties must allow the immediate entry of life sustaining supplies including fuel that are needed for trucking water desalination water pumping and flour production we must be permitted to bring in essential wash supplies tarpaulins tents and poles we also call on the parties to ensure the voluntary movement and safe passage for all civilians seeking emergency shelter and a safe place to stay to reopen repair and augment the capacity of all water lines into the gaza strip and to ensure that the water is safe and not contaminated excellencies the true cost of this latest war in palestine and israel will be measured in childrens lives  those lost to the violence and those forever changed by it without an end to the fighting and full humanitarian access the cost will continue to grow exponentially the destruction of gaza and killing of civilians will not bring peace or safety to the region the people of this region deserve peace only a negotiated political solution  one that prioritizes the rights and wellbeing of this and future generations of israeli and palestinian children  can ensure that i urge the parties to heed this call starting with a humanitarian ceasefire as the first step on the path to lasting peace and i urge you as members of the security council to do everything in your power to end this catastrophe

of the gaza strip have no telecommunications or internet services severely affecting emergency operations and access to information in the southern area as mentioned yesterday services have been temporarily restored the rafah governorate has become the most densely populated area in the gaza strip with hundreds of thousands of displaced squeezed into extremely overcrowded spaces and in dire living conditions the population density is now assessed to exceed 12000 people per square kilometer a fourfold increase prior to the escalation the suffering of displaced people is compounded by the

abedafp via getty images hide caption toggle caption mohammed abedafp via getty images mohammed abedafp via getty images israeli bombardment has killed thousands of civilians in the areas of the gaza strip that israel has ordered them to move to gaza health ministry death tolls show witnesses accounts satellite data and expert assessment gathered by npr show that israeli airstrikes and artillery fire occur daily in the areas israel has said are safer for civilians and have hit schools residential towers and overcrowded united nations refugee shelters amid its military offensive on gaza city and the northern gaza strip the israeli military has repeatedly dropped leaflets and sent messages telling residents they must leave their homes and evacuate to areas it claims are safer which are south of the wadi gaza wetlands middle east crisis  explained satellites and social media offer hints about israels ground war strategy in gaza families have risked journeys through the blasted landscape of destroyed buildings and corpses along the road that israel has designated as a humanitarian corridor through the war for the few hours each day that the road is open people carry or drag wounded loved ones they push wheelchairs with patients just out of surgery in hospitals that have now stopped working mothers pull along weary children who look around with blank fearful stares middle east crisis  explained map after a month of bombardments as much as a third of gaza city is damaged but what awaits palestinians who move south is still lifethreatening the evacuation areas are both heavily bombarded and in a dire humanitarian crisis as israels blockade of fuel and control of aid into the gaza strip leaves people searching for food and access to clean water israels use of the term evacuation for sending palestinians to southern areas is really problematic because it conjures up an idea of a safe route to a place of safety says caitlin procter a research fellow at the center on conflict development and peacebuilding at the geneva graduate institute but the reality is there is no safe place left in gaza for people to go more than 3600 people have been killed south of wadi gaza middle east crisis  explained israeli military hits gazas largest refugee camp israel has vowed to defeat hamas and force an end to its rule of gaza after the oct 7 attack in which hamasled militants killed 1200 people in israel and took more than 240 hostages according to israeli officials the israeli military says it will strike hamas targets wherever necessary so far israeli airstrikes have hit residential buildings bakeries hospitals and even united nationsrun shelters across the heavily populated gaza strip including in the south the israel defense forces press desk responding via whatsapp to questions from npr said on nov 9 that it is operating to protect the security of the state of israel after the hamas attacks middle east crisis  explained heres the available evidence of what happened at al ahli arab hospital in gaza it said it continues to request that all residents move south where it is considered to be safer than the northern gaza strip but it says because hamas has embedded itself in civilian infrastructure and operates across the entire gaza strip the idf will strike hamas wherever necessary earlier this week israels military dropped leaflets telling residents in parts of the southern town of khan younis they too had to leave their homes the idf did not respond to nprs request for comment on this further displacement of civilians the dangers for those fleeing south are evident from the high number of people killed there so far a total of more than 11800 people  of which more than twothirds are children women and elderly  have been killed in gaza since israel launched its military offensive last month according to gazas health ministry a map by the united nations humanitarian affairs office relying on the health ministrys data shows that more than 3600 people  roughly onethird of the total  were killed in areas where israel has told civilians in northern gaza to escape to satellite imagery shows an increase in damage to central and southern gaza since oct 13 loading the latest analysis of imagery from the european space agencys sentinel1 satellite shows a steady increase in the number of buildings destroyed in middle and southern gaza since the beginning of the conflict over 10000 buildings are likely to have been damaged or destroyed by airstrikes in these areas according to analysis by corey scher of new yorks cuny graduate center and jamon van den hoek of oregon state university as npr has previously reported the same satellite analysis shows extensive destruction in northern gaza according to scher and van den hoek the majority  94  of the damage to central and southern gaza appeared after oct 13 when the israeli military ordered the evacuation of northern gaza since oct 30 between 3400 and 4800 additional buildings have been destroyed or damaged in this socalled evacuation zone including in the heavily populated refugee camps of bureij and almaghazi on tuesday israeli airstrikes hit a densely populated residential area in khan younis killing at least 14 people several news reports have noted bombardments also hit residential buildings in the nuseirat refugee camp and deir albalah

military saying they had to leave their home and move south on oct 13 he and 16 relatives including his adult siblings and their children took what few possessions they could and went to stay with a cousin in khan younis in the south of the gaza strip eleven days later at night on oct 24 most of the family were sleeping when saqallah says death came in a multiple rocket attack saqallah says the walls of their apartment caved in on them and the apartment above in the threestory building was destroyed i started praying rubble fell on me my face was burnt he says saqallah says his 11monthold son was killed so was his sister her husband and their three children ages 12 8 and 6 months and so was his younger brother 18 and a cousin middle east crisis  explained a communications blackout in gaza is slowing aid as officials press for hostage deal saqallahs wife who was heavily pregnant was badly wounded when i carried her out of the building her arm was gone and her legs were just flesh he says doctors managed to save her and the baby girl that she has now delivered  named mariam after saqallahs dead sister saqallah 25 says baby mariam has given them a reason to live but they remain broken there is no emotion no life no feeling he says after everything that has happened and were sitting in the hospital now how do you want us to feel bombing has increased in places where israel told palestinians to flee an analysis by the civilian harm watchdog airwars shared with npr finds that in the first week after israel began telling civilians to move south the bombardment on these areas increased the increase was part of intensified airstrikes across the gaza strip enlarge this image palestinians flee to the southern gaza strip on salah aldin street in bureij gaza strip nov 10 fatima shbairap hide caption toggle caption fatima shbairap fatima shbairap the group parsed every report of harm to civilians south of wadi gaza in the first week after israel told civilians to go there including only those events they could geolocate airwars gathered 127 allegations of civilian harm between oct 14 and oct 21 you can see that the frequency and intensity of those allegations of the attacks south of wadi gaza really appeared to increase sanjana varghese a journalist who also works as an investigator at airwars says of the groups asyet unpublished analysis the strikes on the south were part of a pattern of increased israeli bombardment across the whole gaza strip varghese says many of the reported attacks airwars analyzed in the south were around civilian infrastructure including schools hospitals and restaurants calling this area an evacuation zone might technically be true says varghese but its not safe its not a place that people can go to and know that theyll be taken care of most attacks on un shelters have occurred in the south last sunday israeli strikes included an attack on a guesthouse for staff from unrwa the un relief agency that aids palestinians in the southern town of rafah on the border with egypt in this case the employees had just left the building and were not injured but in the past five weeks 102 unrwa staff have been killed  more losses than during any other period in its more than 70year history every day we get more confirmation of more colleagues killed says juliette touma unrwas director of communications based in amman its shattering its just shattering some 830000 displaced people are sheltering in unrwa schools and other buildings they live in cramped conditions sleeping in the schoolyards or in hallways in the most overcrowded shelters there are now over 600 people sharing one toilet unrwa regularly shares the coordinates of its centers with the israeli military and civilians come to the shelters hoping they are safe but even these have become targets over the last month unrwa says 64 of its facilities have been damaged including several in direct strikes it says the attacks have killed 71 people in its shelters and injured 563 more over half of the un agencys buildings that have come under attack are located south of the wadi gaza line unrwa says this shows that nowhere is safe in gaza not the north nor the middle areas or the south says touma civilians including children including women including men including unrwa colleagues have been killed across the board across the gaza strip donatella rovera an investigator with amnesty international with decades of experience covering conflicts tells npr the intensity of israels offensive on gaza is beyond anything weve seen palestinian officials in gaza say the fatalities so far include 4407 children 3137 women and 686 elderly people out of a population of 23 million rovera says the high number of dead shows that the israeli military is willing to carry out strikes on hamas targets despite the presence of many civilians this is why we get so many dead who are clearly noncombatants because they are children women older people people with disabilities rovera says israel claims that hamas militants are embedding with the civilian population and insists it has a right to carry out strikes in its effort to wipe out hamas philippe lazzarini the commissioner general of unrwa told an international conference on gaza in paris last week that thousands of children cannot be collateral damage most displaced palestinians are now in the south and have nowhere else to go unrwa says 70 of gazas population has been displaced in this offensive and most are now south of wadi gaza a tiny area only 16 miles long and between about three and seven miles wide at different points in this overcrowded area palestinians now struggle to find shelter food and water people are gathering wood from the rubble of buildings where possible to make fires to cook over they are searching for water even digging holes to try to reach it says procter of the geneva graduate institute procter lived in gaza and speaks regularly with people there we cant find food and we cant find water abu kareem a resident of rafah told npr this week and we dont have the water to shower even before this war gaza was dependent on aid to function after the oct 7 hamas attack israel imposed what it has called a total siege on the gaza strip blocking fuel and other necessities from entering some aid trucks have now started moving into gaza again but humanitarian groups say the deliveries are not enough to match the need meanwhile unrwa says diseases are spreading and palestinian telecommunications provider paltel said this week its cell towers in the gaza strip had stopped operating for the lack of fuel further cutting off residents from the outside world on friday it announced a partial restoration of services after receiving a limited quantity of fuel via unrwa to restart its generators ruth sherlock reported from rome daniel wood is based in washington dc abu bakr bashir reported from london where fatima alkassab also contributed to this

into the war hundreds of children have been reportedly killed and thousands more reportedly injured unicef is calling for an immediate ceasefire as 11 million peoplenearly half of them childrenhave been warned to move out ahead of what is expected to be a widescale military assault into one of the most densely populated places on earth children and families in gaza have practically run out of food water electricity medicine and safe access to hospitals following days of hostilities and cuts to all supply routes the situation is catastrophic with unrelenting bombing and a massive increase in the displacement of children and families there are no safe places said unicef executive director catherine russellan immediate ceasefire and humanitarian access are the top priorities to allow much needed aid to children and families in gaza we need an immediate humanitarian pause to ensure unhindered and safe access to children in need no matter who they are or where they are there are rules of war children in gaza need lifesaving support and every minute counts homes and critical infrastructure lie in ruin and over 423000 people have already fled their homes some have taken shelter

and staff south in just hours right now there is practically no way out of gaza for the civilian population unicef staff have continued to respond to the critical needs of children across the gaza strip but access is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous humanitarians have also been warned to move out of gaza city but unicef staff will stay in southern gaza to continue to provide support for children in need unicef has distributed nearly all its prepositioned supplies and worked to keep the only functioning desalination plant in the entire gaza strip running in muchreduced capacity the plant provides safe water for 75000 people but without fuel it could come to a halt soon medical supplies and medicines have also been provided to hospitals but given the number of injuries hospital beds and essential medicineincluding anestheticsare quickly running out a child is a child children everywhere must be protected at all times and must never come under attack said

less intensity than the north where its munitions have reduced more than half the buildings to rubblenow after days of hostageforprisoner swaps came to an end  the pause in hostilities also enabled hundreds of trucks of aid to enter gaza  israel is ready to turn its focus to the southon friday warnings to palestinians of imminent air strikes were delivered from the skies in the form of leaflets that fluttered down from israeli jets and of text messages received through a mobile phone network that israel toggles on and off the idf will start a crushing military offensive    for your safety

prisonersin gaza israel is now encouraging palestinians to flee to what it described as a humanitarian area  a 14 sq km plot on the southwestern coast of the strip but senior un officials have warned that crowding more than 2mn people into an area slightly smaller than heathrow airport cannot be accomplished unilaterallythere is no unilaterally declared safe zone in a war zone philippe lazzarini head of unrwa the un palestinian refugee agency told the financial times this week if we want to talk about safer areas we have to insist on stricter adherence to international humanitarian lawat least 1mn displaced people are already seeking sanctuary in public buildings under the protection of the un flag but this has not prevented more than 200 people killed in our premises said lazzarinihundreds more have been injured in un shelters with so many people forced into small areas more death and displacement is likely if israel moves on the south with the same intensity as it had in the north he added palestinians are under pressure to move again following israeli air strikes on the refugee camp in rafah  said khatibafpgetty imagesthe fear is there will also be a staggering number of people who might be killed especially with this density of population lazzarini warned now palestinians find themselves under pressure to move again om mohamed younes 38 fled northern gaza to the tal alsultan neighbourhood west of rafah earlier in the war she has been told she must leave but she hears bombs everywhere where should we go how can we live when theres no food no water to drink and its cold she asked describing her situation as one that cannot be endured by any humanmai youssef and her family of 11 are another group that fled south but the bombs continued to fall the shops were empty and she has received very little of the aid that the truce was supposed to let into gaza two months into her displacement she begged either to be let into egypt or for the mercy of death either they open up the crossing for us civilians to leave or we all die she said we left in search of safety but we havent found it death would be a million times more mercifulrecommendedisraelhamas warin maps israels forced evacuations in gazaher pleas touch on a growing fear that the humanitarian crisis will force palestinians to flee gaza into egypts sinai desert that possibility has been promoted by israels government but it provokes deep alarm in egypt abdel fattah alsisi egypts president spoke openly in october about his conviction that israels campaign was aimed not at destroying hamas but at pushing gazans across the border into his countryegypts foreign minister told the un security council this week that israel was trying to drive palestinians from their land by making life in the gaza strip impossiblefor many palestinians leaving gaza would only realise their greatest fear a repeat of the nakba or catastrophe that befell their people when the jewish state was born in 1948 some 750000 palestinians were forced to flee their homes and they and their descendants have been refugees ever sincemany say that fleeing again like their grandparents

middle east israel struck some areas it directed civilians to in gaza cnn analysis shows by jake tacchi cnn 7 minute read published 606 pm est thu december 21 2023 link copied obtained by cnn cnn  israel has struck at least three locations in gaza to which it had ordered civilians to evacuate since the breakdown of a fragile truce between israel and hamas earlier this month cnn analysis has found on december 1 the israel defense forces idf released a map of gaza  divided into 623 numbered blocks indicating areas the military would imminently strike and areas to which civilians should flee it was made accessible online via a qr code printed on leaflets dropped over the strip the map a vestige of the shortlived plan from the 1970s to rebuild gaza in the early years of israels occupation of the coastal strip was described by the idf as a safe way to preserve your security your lives and the lives of your families residents of gaza are told to please pay attention and check this map while following instructions of the idf through various media outlets said khatibafpgetty images however cnn analysis shows that idf instructions have  at times  been imprecise and confusing regular idf updates highlight numbered blocks in orange urging citizens to evacuate these locations and move to other areas labeled on the map but some of the messaging has been contradictory and concerns have also been raised over palestinians capacity to access the information due to power and telecommunication outages using videos and images shared online satellite imagery and local news reports cnn has verified three israeli strikes on areas where citizens were told to flee since the beginning of the fighting the idf has been imploring the civilian population to temporarily evacuate from areas of intense fighting to safer areas in order to minimize the risk posed by remaining in areas of intense hostilities the idf said in a statement in response to cnns reporting the idf also claimed that they struck the areas identified in this report after intelligence indication that these places were safehouses for commanders of the rafah brigade of the hamas terror organization the idf continues to operate against hamas infrastructure and terrorists wherever they are located in the gaza strip the statement continued strikes in areas civilians directed to on december 2 the idfs spokesperson for arab media avichay adraee posted evacuation orders on social media for citizens in parts of the gaza strip which the idf had dubbed a safe zone in the first month and a half of the war prior to the truce multiple images of the same location were shared  each with different locations highlighted on the map areas to the north and east of the city of khan younis are highlighted orange and arrows instruct residents to evacuate from these areas to almawasi  a 522 square mile coastal strip designated a safe zone by the idf  or to rafah gazas southernmost city aid organizations have raised concerns regarding the almawasi humanitarianzone with the world health organisations who directorgeneral calling it a recipe for disaster due to cramped conditions and lack of infrastructure or services meanwhile analysis shows strikes continued to hit rafah in the three days after adraees post three israeli strikes targeted locations in rafah cnn has found despite idf advice stating gazans should evacuate to rafah on the afternoon of december 3 a strike took place in rafahs elgeneina neighborhood footage filmed moments after the attack shows a large smoke plume rising from a location close to saddam street in rafah photographs and videos shared on social media and geolocated to a position matching the plume show a large crater and multiple buildings that have been damaged or destroyed local media reported at least 17 people were killed and dozens injured in the attack which struck the home of the albawab family later that night another airstrike hit the home of the aljazzar family in the altanour neighborhood of rafah footage captured in the aftermath of the attack shows individuals desperately searching for survivors in the wreckage one video shows a man his legs trapped under rubble being rescued by civil defense teams from palestinian civil defensefacebook cnn geolocated the footage to a house in rafahs altanour neighborhood and confirmed the strike using satellite imagery maxar technologies journalists in the area told cnn that 18 people were killed in the bombing  among them were journalist shaima aljazzar and her family cnn has not been able to independently verify the casualties cnn was also able to verify reports from the following evening december 4 that an israeli strike targeted a public water tower less than 400 meters from the aljazzar family home through analysis of satellite imagery it is possible to confirm the water tower was destroyed between december 3 and 9 there were also reports of at least three other airstrikes on locations in rafah on december2 3 and 5 but cnn was not able to independently verify these attacks confusing messaging about safe zones the idf also issued contradictory messages in the north of gaza which could have led people wrongly to believe they were in safe areas cnn analysis shows on december 2 adraee posted evacuation orders on social media for citizens in the northern gaza strip highlighting a number of blocks to the north of gaza city including large parts of jabalia refugee camp the graphic instructed peoplein these areas to evacuate your homes immediately through the haifa and khalil alwazir axes and go to the known shelter centers and schools in the aldaraj and tuffah neighborhoods and west of gaza city from israel defense forcesx adraee attached two inconsistent images to the instructions both showed the same area but the second image had a larger number of blocks deemed unsafe from israel defense forcesx this created confusing messaging where certain blocks were simultaneously presented as safe and unsafe for example block 720 is not highlighted in the first image but appears in the orange area in the second image block 717 which is partly highlighted in the first image appears squarely in the orange zone in the second image adraee published updated advice on december 3 in which only the image showing the wider shaded area was included cnn has verified two israeli strikes which occurred inside blocks which were not highlighted in the first version of the image  so according to its guidance should have been safe  after adraee shared the contradictory evacuation orders on the evening of december 3 a video appeared online which appeared to show a petrol station engulfed in flames it was released alongside reports that a petrol station in the altuffah neighborhood of gaza city had been hit by an israeli airstrike the video is shot at night making it hard to detect any significant landmarks however reports also claimed that the petrol station was located next to offices of the palestinian civil defense with this information cnn was able to locate a civil defense office and a petrol station sidebyside in the altuffah neighborhood satellite imagery of the area  provided by planet labs on december 4  reveals destruction and clear signs of fire at the location of the petrol station located in block 720 an area that was not highlighted in one of the posted maps the palestinian civil defense later released a statement saying that three members of itscivilian team had been killed and a number of others injured by the bombing planet labs planet labs on the same day local reports claimed that the alsalam mosque in the altuffah neighborhood had been targeted by israeli strikes satellite imagery of the area does not reveal clear damage to the mosque but there are signs of bombing in the surrounding area although it has not been possible to confirm the exact date of this attack  which hit block 717  satellite imagery analysis reveals the strike took place between december 2 and 9 in the days following adraees post correcting initial map the idf says that the maps are reflective of a commitment to ensuring all possible precautions to avoid causing loss of civilian life or injury adopting all available means but rights groups and international organizations have cast doubt on those claims the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ocha has raised concerns over the accessibility of the map for residents of gaza given power outages and telecommunications cuts data from the global internet monitor netblocks reveals that at times when the idf was providing evacuation orders for numbered blocks around gaza network connectivity in the rafah governorate was less than a fifth of peak levels in the khan younis governorate there were times when connectivity was recorded as zero it is unclear how those residing in gaza would access the map without electricity and amid recurrent telecommunications cuts an ocha briefing said related ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback ad feedback search log in my account settings topics

strike at the site of a rescue operation in northern gaza on saturday the idf said saturday that its fighter jets had struck operational headquarters used by hamas militants killing the head of the hamas aerial system in gaza city who the military claimed was largely responsible for directing terrorists during last weeks attack on israel the idf has said that it targets locations associated with hamas in the denselypacked enclave and that hamas leaders have already taken measures to protect themselves from airstrikes health workers refuse to evacuate images from gaza have shown a mass rush toward the south of the coastal enclave beginning friday civilians crammed into cars taxis pickup trucks and even donkeypulled carts roads were filled with snaking lines of vehicles strapped with suitcases and mattresses those without other options walked carrying what they could but not all are leaving some have stayed put in their homes telling cnn they feel nowhere is secure many others cannot be evacuated due to medical conditions health workers say several healthcare facilities in the north of gaza and gaza city say they will not comply with israels evacuation announcement which the world health organization has described as a death sentence for patients we are not willing to evacuate because we do not have the means to evacuate our patients we have around 300 patients at the

border crossing which connects gaza with egypt and is the only passage not controlled by israel could offer a sliver of hope for humanitarian aid eventually entering the territory as well as for

crossing point but its not open and there is no clear direction from the embassy said mai abushaaban a 22yearold from houston who is in contact with her family at the border they told everybody to be

department and the us national security council for comment said khatibafpgetty imagesfile the last remaining exit for gazans is through egypt heres why cairo is reluctant to open it canada had an agreement with israel to get its citizens out of gaza but there was violence around the rafah crossing and therefore the operation had to be canceled canadas foreign affairs minister mélanie joly said egyptian foreign minister sameh shoukry on saturday said foreign nationals would be allowed to cross if protocols were followed on the gaza side he also said israeli aerial bombardment had rendered roads on the gaza side of the crossing inoperable the rafah crossing officially is open on the egyptian side it has been open all along the problem with the roads is that its been subject to aerial bombardment therefore on the gaza side the roads are not in a state that can receive the transit of vehicles shoukry told cnns wolf blitzer egypt has tried to ship humanitarian aid to gaza but has not received the clearance to do so he added a senior jordanian official told cnn earlier this week that both countries were awaiting assurance that aid trucks would not be targeted by israeli airstrikes

airstrike 0244  source cnn jerusalem cnn  israeli strikes targeting hamas commanders and the militant groups infrastructure in the densely populated jabalya refugee camp in northern gaza have left catastrophic damage and killed a large number of people according to eyewitnesses and medics in the enclave the devastation wrought by the strike triggered fresh outcry over spiraling civilian casualties as gazans awoke to another communications blackout wednesday morning survivors and eyewitnesses spoke of apocalyptic scenes in the aftermath of tuesdays strike which tore a massive crater through the middle of the crowded camp i was waiting in line to buy bread when suddenly and without any prior warning seven to eight missiles fell an eyewitness mohammad ibrahim told cnn there were seven to eight huge holes in the ground full of killed people body parts all over the place he said it felt like the end of the world according to a statement by the israel defense forces idf the initial airstrike killed several hamas members including ibrahim biari whom it described as one of the hamas commanders responsible for the october 7 attack on israel which left than 1400 people dead and hundreds taken hostage the idf claimed the central jabalya battalion had taken control of civilian buildings and said collapsed tunnels were partly responsible for the scale of destruction caused by tuesdays strike hamas has claimed to have builthundreds of kilometers of tunnelsunderneath gaza which it has used to smuggle goods from egypt and launch attacks into israel hamas however strongly denied the presence of one of its leaders in the refugee camp hazem qassem a spokesman for the militant group accused israel of attempting to justify what he described as a heinous crime against safe civilians children and women in jabalya camp a second idf strike also hit the falluja neighborhood of the same refugee camp on wednesday the massive blast destroyed several buildings with video from the site showing a deep crater and people digging through the rubble searching for bodies anas alshareefreuters the civil defense in hamasrun gaza described it as the second massacre in two days the airstrike killed at least80people and injured hundreds more according to dr atef al kahlout the director of gazas indonesian hospital he told cnn more bodies were being dug out of the rubble and the majority of casualties were women and children the idf said the wednesday attack targeted a hamas command and control complex and eliminated hamas terrorists the united nations human rights office has said that the attacks on jabalya which is gazas largest refugee camp could amount to war crimes given the high number of civilian casualties and the scale of destruction it wrote on social media israels weeks long bombardment of gaza has killed at least 8700 people according to figures released by the palestinian ministry of health in ramallah drawn from sources in the hamascontrolled enclave women children and the elderly make up more than 70 of those killed the ministry said on monday the strikes continue amid increasingly urgent calls for ceasefire by the un and aid organizations and despite a un general assembly resolution backed by over 100 countries calling for a sustained humanitarian truce seventy united nations aid workers have also been killed according to the uns relief and works agencyfor palestine refugees in the near east unrwa juliette touma the agencys communications director told cnns becky anderson that one colleague was killed at home with his wife and eight children when his un car clearly marked as un was parked outside of his house in new york a united nations human rights official said he was leaving his job amid what he called a textbook case of genocide of palestinians in gaza craig mokhiber director of the uns new york office of the high commissioner for human rights wrote in his departure letter that he believes the us uk and much of europe is complicit in the bloodshed in gaza and that after witnessing what happened in rwanda bosnia and rohingya civilians in myanmar the un has repeatedly failed to stop genocide horrific scene eyewitness mohammad al aswad described a horrific scene in the aftermath of the strike on tuesday telling cnn that he ran to the refugee camp to check on family after hearing the missiles land children were carrying other injured children and running with grey dust filling the air bodies were hanging on the rubble many of them unrecognized some were bleeding and others were burnt al aswad told cnn by telephone cnn israels ground operation in gaza is underway heres what we know about the militarys movements people in the area were hysterical he added i saw women screaming and confused they didnt know whether to cry for losing their children or run and look for them especially since many children were playing in the neighborhood images from the scene showed a huge crater among rubble and damaged buildings palestinians and rescue workers are seen attempting to find victims some using their hands to scoop the detritus away casualty figures from the airstrike are not yet clear and the communications blackout in the strip has made it difficult to establish the full extent of the toll officials in hamasrun gaza as well as medics who treated the casualties say the attack caused hundreds of deaths and injuries jabalya is a densely populated refugee camp established shortly after the arabisraeli war of 1948 when hundreds of thousands of palestinians fled or were expelled from territory that encompassed the newly established state of israel and later denied return the camp is a crowded builtup area with houses shops and apartment buildings jammed up against one another the roads between them in many areas barely wide enough for a car to pass speaking to cnns wolf blitzer idf spokesperson lt col richard hecht accused hamas of hiding as they do behind civilians reminded that there are many innocent civilians in the camp hecht responded this is the tragedy of war and urged civilians to move south southern gaza has also seen lethal airstrikes and aid organizations have repeatedly warned that there is no safe place in the isolated enclave on wednesday two palestinian telecoms firms announced internet and communication network disruptions in gaza paltel said there was a complete interruption of all communications and internet services in the gaza strip while mobile phone services from the communications company jawwal were also down according to a company statement a scene no one can imagine at the indonesian hospital the nearest major medical facility to jabalya videos showed a long line of bodies lying on the floor of the hospital as well as large numbers of wounded people including children as doctors rushed to treat their injuries many of the injured could be seen receiving treatment on the floor because of the hospitals overcrowded conditions hospital head dr atef alkalhout estimated that scores had been killed in the blast what you see is a scene no one can imagine injured martyrs charred bodies in the hundreds said another doctor mohammad al rann all we can do is keep taking them in most of the injuries are from explosives and head injuries and amputations mohammed hawajreh a nurse withdoctors without bordersmsf at al shifa hospital in gaza said that some of the wounded also arrived at that hospital young children arrived at the hospital with deep wounds and severe burns they came without their families many were screaming and asking for their parents i stayed with them until we could find a place as the hospital was full with patients hawajreh said in a statement according to the hamascontrolled ministry of interior in gaza twenty homes were completely destroyed in the bombing blatant disregard for human life jabalya like other refugee camps in the strip is crowded with homes shops and apartment buildings where many roads between them are barely wide enough for a car to pass many palestinian refugees settled in the camp in the wake of the 1948 arabisraeli war after fleeing villages in what became the state of israel according to unrwa jabalya is the largest refugee camp in gaza says unrwa and is spread out across 14 square kilometers it has long grappled with overcrowding it is also among the poorest areas in the enclave and home to busy openair markets shortly after the blast israeli human rights organization btselem condemned israels weekslong aerial bombardment of gaza saying the scale of killing israel has and continues to wreak on gaza is horrifying in a statement released tuesday more than 8000 people have been killed so far more than half of them women and children entire buildings have collapsed with occupants still inside whole families have been wiped out in an instant this criminal harm to civilians is intolerable and the obvious needs to be stated again and again  not everything is allowed in war including war on hamas it said anas alshareefreuters the palestinian ministry of foreign affairs described the strike as a massacre referencing chilling documented scenes of children and women it has its bones in a largescale massacre carried out in full view of the world and under the pretext of selfdefense the statement added saudi arabia iran jordan and egypt have also condemned the strike with egypt accusing israel of breaking international law with what it said was theinhuman targeting of a residential area egypt considered this as a new flagrant violation by the israeli forces against the provisions of international law and international humanitarian law the ministry said i am sorry to those innocent men women and children in jabalia

multiple times throughout a white house briefing on the jabalya strike and on whether israel is doing enough to protect palestinian civilians national security council spokesman john kirby said the us has indications they are trying civilians have been killed to the tune of many thousands  we recognize that we observe that and were not accepting of any single civilian death in gaza he added that it is not the goal of israeli forces to go out and deliberately take innocent civilian life riyad mansour the head of the palestinian permanent observer mission to the united nationstold cnn on tuesday that the israeli strike on jabalya refugee camp was a war crime and should be referred to the international criminal court icc those who are responsible for giving the orders for that crime should hear something from mr karim a a khan from the icc international criminal court he said in reference to the icc prosecutor and if he has the courage and i hope he does we appreciate the fact that he came to rafah crossing and he made a statement there but it would be also nice to issue a warrant of arrest for those who are responsible for such crimes ground operation continues the idf on wednesday announced the death of another soldier bringing the total number of israeli soldiers to have died since the start of the ground incursion to 16 of that figure 15 were killed inside gaza

lives of the most vulnerable people like medical staff patients the wounded premature babies people with disabilities and the elderlyan unbearable human tragedy is unfolding in front of our eyes people call us day and night saying they are afraid to open their door for fear of getting killed and pleading for help to reach safety said william schomburg the head of the icrcs subdelegation in gaza as a humanitarian worker i feel frustrated not being able to respond to these calls as our teams lack basic security conditions to move in northern gazathe icrc is gravely concerned by the precarious and unsafe conditions under which civilians are evacuating men women and children waving white flags walk for dozens of kilometers without necessities like food and water past dead bodies lying on the streets at the same time the icrc teams in gaza and hotline operators receive numerous calls from displaced people searching for their family members it is paramount that members of the same family are not separated during evacuationsirrespective of the arrangements for evacuations safe zones or humanitarian pauses the parties to the conflict continue to be bound by their obligations under international humanitarian lawwhile civilians continue to move from the north to the south of gaza a hundred thousand displaced people lack essentials like shelter food water and hygiene items the situation is rapidly approaching a humanitarian disaster the southern area is not equipped to cater to the massive number of people arriving with nothing but the clothes they are wearing and the quantity of humanitarian aid coming in is largely insufficient the icrc reiterates its call for an unimpeded and regular flow of humanitarian assistancein the past weeks the icrc has stepped up its emergency response in gaza it deployed a surgical team and a significant amount of medical and other critical supplies to support medical facilities throughout the gaza strip the organization continues scaling up its support for emergency health carein the past days the icrc has also coordinated and in some cases accompanied convoys to evacuate hospital patients and displaced people from

between terrorists and civilians and taking all feasible precautions to minimise harm to civiliansin response to our investigation the united nations told sky news that it is already investigating 52

assigned to their neighbourhood and listen out for evacuation orders via social mediaquestions were immediately raised about how gazans who have suffered persistent internet outages would access the online map and how they could safely move between areas as instructedthe un has not officially recommended that gazans relocate to areas suggested by the idf as the zones have not been agreed with all

apparently unresponsive including three childrenthe spokesman for al aqsa hospital told al jazeera mubasher that 45 people were killed in the blast sky news has been unable to independently verify the

that the home had been housing between 70 and 80 people many of them displaced from elsewhere in the gaza stripdamage seen in satellite imagerythe neighbour attributed the bombing to an israeli aircraft as did a report by palestinian news agency wafaeyewitnesses reported a single explosion and footage verified by sky news shows that the damage was extensive the upper floor of the building had collapsed and its walls were blown out onto the street belowvisible damage to the musabeh home can also be seen in satellite imagery taken on 3 december and 6 december no remnants of munitions were available for sky news to conclusively determine whether the idf was responsible for the attacktwo experts told sky news that based on the footage available the damage was consistent with an airstrikeit was a large issues warnings urging people to relocate to a certain area and then nonetheless conducts further strikes there thats not really an effective advanced warningbut even if this warning scheme worked as advertised warnings are not enough israel still has to distinguish between civilians and combatants image palestinians charge their mobile phones from a point powered by solar panels in khan younis even receiving those warnings has been difficult intermittent internet and telecommunications outages have made it much harder for civilians across gaza to find and share information about safe areason 17 december connectivity was gradually restored after a threeday blackout the longest outage on record since the start of the present conflict according to cybersecurity watchdog netblocksbut not all gazans have mobile devices making access to the idf instructions impossible for many many people are having to communicate and share information by word of mouthskys gaza producer asked civilians how effective the map had been for evacuation ordersi talked with different people before about this issue and the thing is none of them have any idea of this map its really difficult and hard to understand it while there is no internet and cut off communication for many days so not everyone has access to the internet or calls so its really difficult for them during this situation she saidand even for those who do have access to phones israels official social media posts and evacuation orders have been confusing and contradictorysky news analysis of the idfs 22 evacuation orders between 1 december and 19 december shows that only nine have included maps of the area to be evacuated in all nine cases these maps have directly contradicted the written orders providedin only six of the 22 orders did the idf cite specific numbered zones in all six cases parts of the numbered zones were excluded from the static maps attached to the poststhis chaos and confusion could have killed me the idfs interactive map was presented as a hightech humane solution to conducting urban warfare in one of the most densely populated parts of the planetyet this map has never been updated to show areas being evacuated  gazans have had to rely on static maps published via social medianone of the evacuation orders have included any mapping of areas to which people can safely flee instead these areas have simply been namedin the four evacuation orders issued since 16 december that too has stopped gazans have been told where to flee from but not where they might flee tothe only safe area which the idf has mapped is a strip of coastline that israel has called the almawasi humanitarian zone it has provided rough sketches of this zone but has never marked it out clearly the two maps it has produced are when analysed in mapping software contradictory even when the orders are clear as in the recent orders for civilians to leave the north and head towards deir al balah it is often unclear how gazans are supposed to safely make the journeykamal almashharawi a lawyer from gaza city who recently fled the territory recently spoke to a friend in northern gaza who told him it was too dangerous to even open the curtains due to fighting outsidemr almashharawi was forced to flee the north himself after israel first ordered its evacuation on 13 octoberthis chaos and confusion could have killed me says mr almashharawi who is now in saudi arabiai was in khan younis at first and i thought that the ground invasion would start there so i had to go back to gaza city we hadnt heard of any bombing there we didnt realise its because the internet was cutmr almashharawi says that he subsequently arranged an evacuation from gaza city for himself and around 30 family memberson the safe passage i saw dead bodies on the ground those people read the instructions and followed the instructions and now theyre deadmr sunghay said the un was planning to publish a report on incidents in areas where the idf had told civilians to flee to including deir al balahif we are unable to prevent attacks and killings of civilians what will come next is accountability and for that purpose this work is extremely important he said be the first to get breaking news install the sky news app for free a spokesperson for the idf said since the beginning of the fighting the idf has been imploring the civilian population to temporarily evacuate from areas of intense fighting to safer areas in order to minimise the risk posed by remaining in areas of intense hostilitiesthe idf carries out this effort in a variety of ways including radio broadcasts a dedicated website in arabic millions of prerecorded phone calls and tens of thousands of live phone calls and millions of leafletswhile the idf makes these efforts to evacuate the population out of the line of fire hamas systematically attempts to prevent the evacuation of civilians by calling on the civilians to ignore

roof by the force of the explosionhow will this child continue her life after learning what happened to her familydays earlier on 1 december a temporary ceasefire had collapsed in preparation for an invasion of southern gaza israel published an interactive map which divided the territory into hundreds of small zonesthe map israel said would be used to give clear and precise evacuation orders to try to keep civilians in the densely populated gaza strip away from active combat zonesusing ontheground footage satellite imagery and mapping software a sky news visual investigation found that israels evacuation orders have instead been chaotic and contradictory and that a neighbourhood in deir al balah was hit one day after the idf said evacuees could flee thereour investigation comes after a separate strike in gaza was caught on camera by a sky news team it too came in an area that was supposed to be safeno safe place in gazaresponding to a request for comment on our findings the israeli army did not deny striking the musabeh homea spokesperson for the idf said the idf will act against hamas wherever it operates with full commitment to international law while distinguishing between terrorists and civilians and taking all feasible precautions to minimise harm to civiliansin response to our investigation the united nations told sky news that it is already investigating 52 similar incidents in areas where the israeli army told civilians it was safe to evacuate tothis is exactly why we as the un have been saying that there is no safe place in gaza ajith sunghay head of the office of the un high commissioner for human rights in the occupied palestinian territories told sky newschaotic orders after the temporary ceasefire israel faced growing international pressure to limit civilian harmthe idfs solution the interactive map with each zone having a unique numeric id image an image of the interactive map was then posted on the israeli armys website pic idf on 4 december idf spokesman daniel hagari told journalists that the map would indicate where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfirecivilians were told to learn the number assigned to their neighbourhood and listen out for evacuation orders via social mediaquestions were immediately raised about how gazans who have suffered persistent internet outages would access the online map and how they could safely move between areas as instructedthe un has not officially recommended that gazans relocate to areas suggested by the idf as the zones have not been agreed with all parties to the conflictone of the fundamental requirements of a safe zone is that all parties agree to a particular place to be safe said mr sunghayon 1 december the day hostilities resumed the israeli army began releasing evacuation orders image the deleted static map was the first grid map published by the israeli army pic idf musabeh home hit the musabeh familys neighbourhood is located

the musabeh home in deir al balah gaza strip 5 december 2023 footage of the incident verified by sky news including some which is too graphic to publish shows 11 casualties in total  nine of them apparently unresponsive including three childrenthe spokesman for al aqsa hospital told al jazeera mubasher that 45 people were killed in the blast sky news has been unable to independently verify the exact number of those killedpreliminary research carried out by airwars an organisation specialising in the verification of airstrike casualties found online tributes to one of those killed in the attack mohammad kamal abu musabeh and further posts about the injured infant layan information online surrounding the identity of those killed has been scarcea neighbour of the musabehs told al araby that the home had been housing between 70 and 80 people many of them displaced from elsewhere in the gaza stripdamage seen in satellite imagerythe neighbour attributed the bombing to an israeli aircraft as did a report by palestinian news agency wafaeyewitnesses reported a single explosion and footage verified by sky news shows that the damage was extensive the upper floor of the building had collapsed and its walls were blown out onto the street belowvisible damage to the musabeh home can also be seen in satellite imagery taken on 3 december and 6 december no remnants of munitions were available for sky news to conclusively determine whether the idf was responsible for the attacktwo experts told sky news that based on the footage available the damage was consistent with an airstrikeit was a large issues warnings urging people to relocate to a certain area and then nonetheless conducts further strikes there thats not really an effective advanced warningbut even if this warning scheme worked as advertised warnings are not enough israel still has to distinguish between civilians and combatants image palestinians charge their mobile phones from a point powered by solar panels in khan younis even receiving those warnings has been difficult intermittent internet and telecommunications outages have made it much harder for civilians across gaza to find and share information about safe areason 17 december connectivity was gradually restored after a threeday blackout the longest outage on record since the start of the present conflict according to cybersecurity watchdog netblocksbut not all gazans have mobile devices making access to the idf instructions impossible for many many people are having to communicate and share information by word of mouthskys gaza producer asked civilians how effective the map had been for evacuation ordersi talked with different people before about this issue and the thing is none of them have any idea of this map its really difficult and hard to understand it while there is no internet and cut off communication for many days so not everyone has access to the internet or calls so its really difficult for them during this situation she saidand even for those who do have access to phones israels official social media posts and evacuation orders have been confusing and contradictorysky news analysis of the idfs 22 evacuation orders between 1 december and 19 december shows that only nine have included maps of the area to be evacuated in all nine cases these maps have directly contradicted the written orders providedin only six of the 22 orders did the idf cite specific numbered zones in all six cases parts of the numbered zones were excluded from the static maps attached to the poststhis chaos and confusion could have killed me the idfs interactive map was presented as a hightech humane solution to conducting urban warfare in one of the most densely populated parts of the planetyet this map has never been updated to show areas being evacuated  gazans have had to rely on static maps published via social medianone of the evacuation orders have included any mapping of areas to which people can safely flee instead these areas have simply been namedin the four evacuation orders issued since 16 december that too has stopped gazans have been told where to flee from but not where they might flee tothe only safe area which the idf has mapped is a strip of coastline that israel has called the almawasi humanitarian zone it has provided rough sketches of this zone but has never marked it out clearly the two maps it has produced are when analysed in mapping software contradictory even when the orders are clear as in the recent orders for civilians to leave the north and head towards deir al balah it is often unclear how gazans are supposed to safely make the journeykamal almashharawi a lawyer from gaza city who recently fled the territory recently spoke to a friend in northern gaza who told him it was too dangerous to even open the curtains due to fighting outsidemr almashharawi was forced to flee the north himself after israel first ordered its evacuation on 13 octoberthis chaos and confusion could have killed me says mr almashharawi who is now in saudi arabiai was in khan younis at first and i thought that the ground invasion would start there so i had to go back to gaza city we hadnt heard of any bombing there we didnt realise its because the internet was cutmr almashharawi says that he subsequently arranged an evacuation from gaza city for himself and around 30 family memberson the safe passage i saw dead bodies on the ground those people read the instructions and followed the instructions and now theyre deadmr sunghay said the un was planning to publish a report on incidents in areas where the idf had told civilians to flee to including deir al balahif we are unable to prevent attacks and killings of civilians what will come next is accountability and for that purpose this work is extremely important he said be the first to get breaking news install the sky news app for free a spokesperson for the idf said since the beginning of the fighting the idf has been imploring the civilian population to temporarily evacuate from areas of intense fighting to safer areas in order to minimise the risk posed by remaining in areas of intense hostilitiesthe idf carries out this effort in a variety of ways including radio broadcasts a dedicated website in arabic millions of prerecorded phone calls and tens of thousands of live phone calls and millions of leafletswhile the idf makes these efforts to evacuate the population out of the line of fire hamas systematically attempts to prevent the evacuation of civilians by calling on the civilians to ignore the idfs requests in doing so hamas endangers the civilian population of gazathe data and forensics team is a multiskilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from sky news we gather
