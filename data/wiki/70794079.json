It took place on Saturday, June 4, 2022, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida and aired on WWE's livestreaming platforms.\n\nIn June 2020, WWE revived In Your House as a subseries of the NXT TakeOver series. In September 2021, however, the TakeOver series was discontinued after NXT reverted to being WWE's developmental territory. With the scheduling of this 2022 event, In Your House became its own event for NXT. Unlike the previous year's event, which also aired on pay-per-view (PPV), the 2022 event was only available via livestreaming, as beginning with Stand & Deliver in April, NXT's major events no longer air on PPV.\n\nEight matches were contested at the event, including two dark matches that were later streamed on Level Up. All five championships exclusive to the NXT brand were contested for; two were lost while the other three were retained. In the main event, Bron Breakker defeated Joe Gacy to retain the NXT Championship. In other prominent matches, The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed) defeated Pretty Deadly (Elton Prince and Kit Wilson) to win the NXT Tag Team Championship, Carmelo Hayes defeated Cameron Grimes to win the NXT North American Championship, and in the opening bout, The D'Angelo Family (Tony D'Angelo, Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo, and Troy \"Two Dimes\" Donovan) defeated Legado Del Fantasma (Santos Escobar, Cruz Del Toro, and Joaquin Wilde).\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nIn Your House was a series of monthly pay-per-view (PPV) shows that were held by WWE from May 1995 to February 1999. They aired when the promotion was not holding one of its then-five major PPVs (WrestleMania, King of the Ring, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble), and were sold at a lower cost. The branding was retired following February 1999's St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House event, as the company moved to install permanent names for each of its monthly PPVs. After 21 years, In Your House was revived in 2020 for WWE's NXT brand as a subseries of the NXT TakeOver series, being held annually in June. In September 2021, however, the TakeOver series was discontinued after NXT was rebranded as NXT 2.0, reverting the brand to being WWE's developmental territory. Despite TakeOver's discontinuation, the announcement of the 2022 event confirmed that In Your House would continue on as NXT's annual June event. It was scheduled to be held on Saturday, June 4, 2022, at NXT's home base of the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. It was the 30th event in the In Your House chronology and the third held under the NXT banner. Unlike the previous year, which also aired on traditional pay-per-view, the 2022 event was only available to livestream on Peacock in the United States and the WWE Network in international markets.\n\nStorylines\n\nThe card included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on the weekly television program, NXT, and the supplementary online streaming show, Level Up.\n\nAt the NXT special Spring Breakin' on May 3, Bron Breakker defeated Joe Gacy to retain the NXT Championship. Following the match, however, Breakker was attacked by hooded minions under the command of Gacy before being carried out of the building on a stretcher by the henchmen and dumped on the side of a road. The following week, Gacy offered an invitation to Breakker to join his movement. On the May 17 episode of NXT, Breakker declined. Gacy then offered Breakker a rematch for the title, adding the stipulation that Breakker would lose the title if he was disqualified due to him not being able to control his anger, making the match official for In Your House.\n\nDuring the NXT Stand & Deliver Kickoff pre-show, Wendy Choo cost Toxic Attraction (Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne) the NXT Women's Tag Team Championship. However, on the following episode of NXT, Dolin and Jayne won back the titles, due to NXT Women's Champion and Toxic Attraction leader Mandy Rose preventing interference from Choo. In the coming weeks, Choo kept targeting the stable, including an unsuccessful attempt at winning the NXT Women's Tag Team Championship. On the May 24 episode of NXT, after Choo attacked Rose after the latter's match, Rose accepted Choo's challenge for an NXT Women's Championship match, which was scheduled for In Your House in a Women's Championship Summit the next week.\n\nAt NXT Stand & Deliver, Carmelo Hayes lost the NXT North American Championship to Cameron Grimes in a five-way ladder match. At Spring Breakin', Hayes failed to win the title in a triple threat match also involving Solo Sikoa, who Grimes pinned to retain the title. On the following episode of NXT, Sikoa wanted another shot at the title, and Grimes said that he would get the match after Grimes defeated Hayes at In Your House. The next day, a match between Grimes and Hayes for the title was made official for In Your House.\n\nOn May 15, Pretty Deadly (Kit Wilson and Elton Prince) were scheduled to defend the NXT Tag Team Championship against The Creed Brothers (Brutus Creed and Julius Creed) at In Your House. Wilson and Prince last eliminated The Creed Brothers in a gauntlet match to win the vacant titles on the April 12 episode of NXT. On the May 31 episode of NXT, a further stipulation was added in that The Creed Brothers must leave Diamond Mine should they lose.\n\nIn April, Legado Del Fantasma (Santos Escobar, Cruz Del Toro, Elektra Lopez, and Joaquin Wilde) began feuding with Tony D'Angelo, the self-proclaimed \"Don of NXT\" and his \"family\". On the April 26 episode of NXT, D'Angelo revealed his associates to be Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo and Troy \"Two Dimes\" Donovan, after they cost D'Angelo his match. At Spring Breakin', D'Angelo and Escobar agreed to an uneasy truce. The following week, Escobar stated that AJ Galante was fair game in the war due to his interference in the peace talks. D'Angelo responded by kidnapping Toro in his car trunk and leaving the Performance Center. A match between Escobar and D'Angelo was scheduled for the May 17 episode. During the match, a brawl between Toro, Wilde, Lorenzo, and Donovan occurred at ringside, which allowed Escobar to strike D'Angelo with brass knuckles and give Escobar the win. The following week, after Donovan and Lorenzo's match, the two teams brawled. On the May 31 episode, the two teams agreed to a six-man tag team match at In Your House where the losing team would join the winning team's stable.\n\nReception\n\nDave Meltzer rated Cameron Grimes vs Carmelo Hayes and Legado Del Fantasma vs Channing \"Stacks\", Tony, and Troy both received 3.75 stars, the highest of the night. The lowest rated match of the night was Mandy Rose vs Wendy Choo, which received 1.5 stars. Elsewhere, the women's tag title match received 2.75 stars, Pretty Deadly vs The Creeds received 2.75 stars and the main event received the same rating as the Pretty Deadly match.\n\nAftermath\nNew NXT North American Champion Carmelo Hayes, with Trick Williams, opened the following episode of NXT, but was quickly interrupted by Solo Sikoa, who wanted a shot at the title. Grayson Waller interrupted, stating that nobody likes Sikoa, which is why they called him \"Solo\". Waller, Hayes, and Williams then laid out Sikoa, leading to a 2-on-1 handicap match pitting Sikoa against Waller and Hayes being scheduled for that episode's main event. However, after making his NXT return earlier that night, Apollo Crews teamed with Sikoa to defeat Waller and Hayes.\n\nWith Legado Del Fantasma (Santos Escobar, Cruz Del Toro, Joaquin Wilde, and Elektra Lopez) joining The D'Angelo Family (Tony D'Angelo, Channing \"Stacks\" Lorenzo, and Troy \"Two Dimes\" Donovan), they would accompany each other during matches with them usually losing. On the following episode of NXT, Escobar lost his match after he didn't want to use his crowbar against his opponent. On the June 21 episode (taped June 8), Escobar cost D'Angelo his NXT North American Championship match. This was Donovan's final WWE appearance, as he was released on June 12 due to a policy violation. On the June 28 episode, he was written off television when D'Angelo threw him off the bridge and into the water. D'Angelo thought that Donovan tried to steal his throne. At NXT: The Great American Bash on July 5, D'Angelo revealed that Escobar was hospitalized and the other members of Legado began working with The D'Angelo Family. Escobar returned on the August 2 episode of NXT, where he cost Lorenzo and D'Angelo their NXT Tag Team Championship match, signaling that their alliance has ended. A street fight between D'Angelo and Escobar was later scheduled for Heatwave, where D'Angelo won to end the feud and, as per the match stipulation, Escobar and the rest of Legado agreed to leave NXT if that happened.\n\nResults\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n2022 WWE Network events\nJune 2022 events in the United States\nWWE NXT\nIn Your House\nEvents in Orlando, Florida\nProfessional wrestling in Orlando, Florida\n2022 in professional wrestling in Florida", "unikey": "NXT In Your House (2022)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Production", "Aftermath", "Results", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["### Background\nIn Your Housewas a series of monthlyprofessional wrestlingpay-per-view(PPV)eventsoriginally produced byWWEfrom May 1995 to February 1999.

wrestling championship in new orleans louisiana photo courtesy ssgt jason m carter usmc  defense visual information center advertisement  photo courtesy journalist 1st class kristin fitzsimmons  us department of defense wrestling does have rules which well explain in more detail later however the rules are loosely defined and loosely enforced the skills of the wrestlers do not determine the outcome of the match instead writers work on plots and storylines well in advance and every match is another chapter in the story who wins and who loses is all in the script does that mean that wrestling is fake its true that the plots are predetermined and the moves are choreographed wrestlers arent really trying to beat up and injure each other sometimes the bitterest enemies in the ring are really best friends and the outlandish stories surrounding the characters are usually not true however simply calling wrestling fake is like calling an action movie fake when you see a movie you know that the actor didnt really jump a burning car over an exploding bridge but youre still entertained stunt people and special effects crews worked to make those scenes seem real and their work can be very impressive pro wrestling is like that most wrestlers are exceptional athletes who train for many hours each day to maintain their physical condition they practice for years to learn both the moves and how to execute them safely while still making it look dangerous they suffer many injuries sometimes severe their schedules are grueling theres certainly nothing fake about flying 20 feet

full postshow recording nxt enters a special episode as theyre down 42 this month year over year in ratings and after the latest round of cuts ive never had so little desire to consume the product and i have serious doubts this show can survive on usa for much longer before they tell it to hit the road i dont know what wwe thought would happen to morale and ratings with all these changes but they were foreseen by practically everyone shortly into the 20 era and theyre still occasionally acting surprised well lets see if they can build back some goodwill tonight a series of provocative shots of backsides exposed bellies and legs played hilariously pretty deadly were revealed they used their tag team championship belts to do some tanning next to a pool and ran down some of tonights matches 1 cameron grimes c vs solo sikoa vs carmelo hayes wtrick williams  triple threat match for the nxt north american championship carmelo and trick entered first and solo got a good pop to follow good reaction for grimes though still not as spirited as they were when he turned face but hadnt yet changed a large part of his persona alicia taylor handled formal intros though strangely she wasnt actually in the ring grimes reaction was actually mixed here and a solo chant got going hayes talked trash early and the faces peppered him with rights big back body drop from sikoa on hayes hayes bailed and the faces paired off grimes rolled up sikoa twice then a third time while rolling sikoa up in between each instance for two grimes hip tossed hayes into sikoa and hayes hit a rana hayes took over on offense on both guys with kicks then a springboard legdrop for grimes hayes got dumped again grimes hit a pk from the apron on hayes then a highcross body on sikoa he covered and hayes charged in to break it up grimes dominated briefly on offense until sikoa hip tossed him into a buckle he set up a charge but hayes took him out grimes hit his twisting slam on hayes and sikoa broke it up with a senton heading into splitscreen hayes controlled the break and sikoa charged in with a senton but hayes got his knees up grimes ran the ropes for some axhandles on hayes grimes lifted hayes for something but sikoa thrustkicked grimes and hayes followed through with a destroyer in the corner a contrived yet smooth spot saw sikoa powerbomb grimes who was suplexing hayes all three guys hit their feet and exchanged rights forearms turned to kicks and sikoa was able to stack up grimes in the tree of woe above a grounded hayes and he hit both with a hip attack powerbomb for grimes and then one for hayes atop grimes spinning uranage by sikoa on hayes and grimes flew in to break it up at two sikoa went up and grimes grounded him with an enzuigiri grimes went up and missed but landed on his feet and hit a rana on both poison rana for hayes who kicked out at nearly three hayes caught grimes on a cave in attempt and rolled him up for a very long two hayes went up but flew into a sikoa thrustkick sikoa hit a frog splash on grimes for the longest two youll ever see broken up by hayes sikoa caught hayes for a planned samoan drop but grimes hit a cave in from the top on sikoa and then covered for three the camera went to a reaction shot from a guy wearing a dakota kai shirt as am i winner cameron grimes at 1406 wellss analysis incredible triple threat i dont typically need them in my life but absences were explained and the work was relentless mandy rose greeted the workers at a tanning bed she got into her bed and closed the door over her wendy choo tiptoed in and turned the heat on mandy way up we caught it on video is that a gross misdemeanor or just a misdemeanor rose came out looking comically red and greeted the other members of toxic attraction who giggled at her appearance rose said lets go to the beach looking like only we can which such weird emphasis on the wrong words its hard to believe this is her first language nathan frazer was optimistic ahead of his match with grayson waller the evershrinking diamond mine met in their training room he stated he was the leader of diamond mine and no mention was made of malcolm bivens other than by the fans who chanted his name strong fighting to match the level of mandy roses acting chops talked down the creed brothers for their failures indi hartwell and duke hudson stood by lockers both looked sad in an acknowledgement of their major storyline being completely upended by the recent cuts indi played with her wedding ring hudson misreading the situation leaned in for a kiss and hartwell said oh hell no and hudson said you wish 2 nathan frazer vs grayson waller speedy reversals to open headlock takeover by frazer action went near a turnbuckle and both missed spots until frazer hit a shotgun dropkick waller bailed and frazer set up a tope but was thwarted as waller ran up the ramp frazer followed and waller got the better of him we were shown chase universitys contingent watching from the stands frazer tried a springboard but waller tossed him to drape him over the top rope and dump him out waller went and got a beach ball from the decorations up on the ramp and ripped it up to boos the match went to splitscreen frazer dumped waller with a dropkick but waller recovered and hit a charging frazer with a spinning heel kick then a legdrop for two waller stomped his feet in mockery of seth rollins and frazer recovered and dumped waller then hit a tope frazer rolled waller inside and went up and missed a shot but hit a superkick right after then another and waller grabbed the bottom rope to break the count frazer missed a phoenix splash he landed on his feet but waller flattened him and covered for two waller charged the corner where frazer moved frazer took waller up and waller shoved frazer off the top and hung him up waller posed and andre chase used an air horn and waller freaked out and also fell and hung up on the top frazer hit a phoenix splash and got the three count as vic mispronounced his name as frasier over and over and over winner nathan frazer at 1240 wellss analysis other than the overly contrived finish which they sort of got away with given wallers pinpoint fall and chases excitement this was pretty good action frazer moves around at lightspeed at all times and itll be interesting to see if he can work a slower pace effectively or if hell even be asked to fallon henley segment as i said on last weeks podcast i didnt recognize her at first away from briggs and jensen she likes to get rowdy but shes a simple country girl at heart she said shed show everyone what she could do in the breakout tournament all of legado del fantasma met with tony dangelo aj galante and his tag team goons santos escobar wanted to know why galante was there dangelo said he called the meeting so this doesnt escalate escobar said dangelo chose to play games and called out these two goofs attacking him he said playing games got them to this point dangelo said there was enough business to go around in nxt  enough pieces of pie escobar asked if there was a way to come together and do business dangelo said he doesnt sit back to anyone he asked escobar who he thinks he is escobar asked for a truce d said his consigliere galante said that peace is best for business escobar sent over an alreadypoured glass of wine

download or stream the full show postrecording natalya went for a surfboard stretch and hit ive always liked the visual of the surfboard stretch jade rolled out of it from the elevated position and hit a basement dropkick natalya pushed her away but jade just slapped the hell out of natalya natalya was mad and lifted her for a canadian backbreaker but jade turned it into an arm drag jade seems to be thinking through her spots here jade hit a running knee to natalya in the ropes then hit a tornado ddt using the ropes for a nearfall twocount jade climbed to the top rope but natalya met her with punches and climbed to the second rope for a superplex jade fought a bit and knocked her off but then jade rolled through she went for sliced bread 2 but natalya countered only for the sharpshooter to be turned into a rollup natalya hit her nattie by nature discus clothesline for a twocount natalya then suplexed jade into the ropes leg snapping on the rope natalya then hit a chop block to the left leg and then slammed the leg into the mat softening it up in the corner natalya went outside and slammed jades leg into the post will she go for the figure four on the post she slammed jades leg again into the post then broke the count before heading back out yes she went for the figure four but jade kicked her and then forced natalya into the post shoulderfirst back in the ring natalya was selling the shoulder as she went to suplex jade but jade hit an inside cradle for a twocount jade hit a stepup enziguri then using the rope to hit a double stomp on natalyas back for a twocount jades selling of the knee only happens after she hits moves rather than when shes moving as well she hit sliced bread 2 for a twocount and went for a jackknife cover that natalya turned into a sunset pin jade then went for and locked in the sharpshooter to natalya but just like when wrestlers did it to bret hart she easily broke the hold as joseph said the knee buckled on jade causing the break jade climbed to the second rope but got caught by natalya into the sharpshooter in the middle of the ring jade fought and cried out in agony but eventually and badly passed out winner natalya at 1410 sharpshooter after the match natalya approached jade and extended her hand they shook and hugged as the show ended hazelwoods take the ending just took me out of it because you could see jade talking to the ref about how much time they had left and then so suddenly passing out however that aside that was probably jades best match in nxt even if i cant buy most of her offense it helps when natalya is in there with you tatum paxleys best match also came with natalya for natalya she said she wants the nxt womens championship which she almost won against charlotte flair after paige made herraw debut what eight years ago now natalya nabbing that will mean like flair and banks and bayley theyll have won all of the modern wwe titles for women  not counting divas championship and she won that too who does she work next in this regard does she go straight for rose or someone like hartwell or nile hartwell makes more sense than nile and could begin a leelike finding yourself story for hartwell final thoughtsthis is the rare rare episode where there wasnt one match that was mens only with the mixed tag team match coming closest five of the six matches were womens matches which might be the most womens matches on any wwe show sinceevolution the breakout tournament matches went as expected both in terms of outcome and match length and im hoping there is more time dedicated to these matches net week and beyond im really high on lees character and his eventual singles push but quinns character is justrude and no one knows what run it straight means im very intrigued by whats next for strattonwaller and sarraychaseheyward as well as millers continued development coming off ofspring breakin this was about as good an episode as you could have hoped for

dont listen live download or stream the full show postrecording recap of last weeks show finishing with cora jade and natalyas embrace 1 cameron grimes  solo sikoa vs carmelo hayes  trick williams the heels entered first and hayes said sikoa needs to shut up because he doesnt have next hes got last the cwc fans in a rare and disappointing turn of events picked up the what chant sikoa and grimes in that order got separate entrances the heels attempted to rush the faces only to run into superkicks at the bell sikoa and williams were legal to open sikoa stomped williams and kicked him in the chest when he tried to get up body slam followed by another kick to the chest sikoa took williams to the face corner for a tag they took turns with some corner kicks and grimes hit a pk and covered for two grimes worked a brief chinlock then sent williams for a rope run blind tag by hayes who used both the rope and williams for a springboard crossbody for two tags to sikoa and williams sikoa dominated williams in a corner and hit a running hip attack sikoa cleared an interfering hayes but hayes got a kick in and williams took over then posed as the match went to splitscreen hayes worked a chinlock on sikoa with some torque he grounded sikoa then battered him to the heel corner sikoa dumped hayes who landed on his feet tripped sikoa then flew in for a springboard splash williams tagged in and missed a corner splash grimes made the hot tag and dominated both heels hitting his dual rana then a pk on the outside high crossbody for hayes grimes made his to the moon taunt in his corner and sikoa tagged himself in to the mild annoyance of grimes the heels briefly got the better of sikoa but sikoa beat them back sikoa set up a frog splash on hayes trick tried to interfere and grimes took him out with the cave in sikoa finished hayes with the frog splash handshake in the ring sikoa briefly held the north american championship belt before handing it over to grimes who held it high winners grimes  sikoa at 957 wellss analysis decent building block to the next two challengers  grimes will defend against hayes first but sikoa gets the next match no matter who comes out the winner clearly theyre not hiding that grimes will win and face sikoa barring a big swerve fun spirited match with good character work and setup for the future bouts mckenzie mitchell talked to tag team champions pretty deadly who briefly pretended to be afraid of the creed brothers before laughing and mocking the creeds they said they were two tasty snacks and one meal deal they also got in a little mockery of the viking raiders on their way out of the frame thea hail interview she said the nxt tryout was the hardest thing shes ever done she said she was pretty sure she was the youngest one there she said she was looking forward to her nxt career but theres one thing she has to do first graduate high school she said watch out nxt here i come she hit the last words with so much forced energy i couldnt stifle a laugh but she does have some good energy and i can see what they see in her potential 2 tatum paxley vs lash legend  womens breakout tournament quarterfinal match lash flew in with a strike for an early two paxley showed off her power and tried to lift legend on her shoulders but didnt succeed this time dueling chant was about 60 paxley paxley tried a rollup but legend cut it off with some kicks to paxleys thigh legend jawed with some frontrow fans in between some more strikes legend worked paxleys leg around her own head and paxley wriggled free and got a brief hope spot before legend took over paxley got back into it with a suplex then hit a standing phoenix splash sorta for two impressive movement but the impact really isnt there legend hit a pump kick out of relative nowhere to finish winner lash legend at 350 wellss analysis this tournaments booking is so baffling with the tournament being used to help stars that have already broken out break out further roxanne perez likely has a shot in the semis against legend but they could just be going for a third legendlyons match and squandering the tournament to get there tony dangelo stacks and dimes cut a brief promo on santos escobar basic heel work to add something to tonights likely main event special olympics segment clash at the castle was briefly hyped by the announcers im far from the first to say this but i absolutely love the poster for the event nxt live event hype it was all localized in the southeast but at least theyre on the road again mckenzie mitchell interviewed duke hudson who once again had the task of referencing his recent changes and struggles without the luxury of actually naming persia pirotta bron breakker disrespectfully walked through the frame and hudson asked what he was doing breakker just said hit my music then kept walking he then exited to the ramp suggesting that mitchell has for some reason chosen the gorilla position literally the worst possible place for privacy for her interviews bron breakker entered the ring and cut a promo on joe gacy he said gacy shouldve finished the job out in the field because now he wasnt just coming to beating him he was coming to put you unconscious that sounds like a steinerism joe gacy showed up on the perch with his two druids now in crimson robes breakker begged him to come down and gacy called out breakkers temper he said he could see the fire in breakkers eyes and said their journey together wasnt over he said breakker turned down the opportunity of a lifetime when he wouldnt join gacy but he wasnt a petty man he said hed give the fans what they want  a oneonone he called out all the things hed done to breakker and said he should be angry and he should lose control but hed better be careful  if he gets disqualified at in your house hell lose his championship he asked breakker how bad he wants it bron said youre on wellss analysis again a match for in your house was announced casually by a wrestler decent segment and a genuinely interesting development for their match that adds a lot of doubt on who will come out with the belt indi hartwell got a backstage hype segment shes on her own for the first time no tag partner no life partner she said she was calling her shot at mandy rose she said rose kicked her when she was down but itll be different when she tries to kick her when theyre standing face to face good fire from hartwell mckenzie talked to wes lee who said xyon quinn was ducking him he said when quinn is ready hell be easy to find nathan frazer walked into frame and said he had issues with quinn too lee said now wasnt the time because he has pent up aggression and wouldnt want to take it out on frazer frazer said in that case he looks forward to the challenge 3 the creed brothers julius  brutus wroderick strong  damon kemp vs the viking raiders erik  ivar julius hopped over ivar and kicked him back to open tag to brutus and the creeds teamed up to block ivar from the ring ivar regrouped with erik and made the tag dueling chant was 80 creeds at first but evened out quite a bit as this was clearly part of the loudest fan contest erik hit a hard forearm on a running julius and the raiders hit a tandem block quick pair of tags by the raiders erik covered after a hard ivar lariat on julius and got two julius got over for the tag and brutus got in some forearms and then did some brutal ground and pound deadlift german for erik ivar tried to interfere and brutus deadlifted him to the top buckle wow julius hit a dropkick to send ivar to the floor the raiders tried to regroup on the floor but brutus hit a brutus bomb cherry bomb to both of them heading into commercial brutus in actuality only nicked the raiders and seemingly took a harder fall to the floor than intended previous article next article related articles njpw battle in the valley report 113  lansdells report on ospreay vs okada moxley vs takagi more january 14 2024

lorenzo dangelo called out santos escobar saying he only got him with brass knuckles he said they better be paying close attention as stacks and two dimes take it to idris enofe and malik blade they showed escobar appearing behind them as they left 1 edris enofe  malik blade vs troy two dimes donovan  channing stacks lorenzo  tag team match im not really sure who is who but vic joseph said lorenzo began the match then tagged in donovan as they took it enofe donovan hit a big bodyslam for a onecount donovan two dimes tagged back in but ate a big dropkick after a unique leapfrog and duck under by enofe blade tagged in and hit a doubl axe handle to the left arm followed by a double bellytoback suplex for a twocount on donovan who joseph said was stacks is he confused now blade hit his own dropkick and im not sure who is who on the other team after josephs miscue enofe tagged in and they hit some good double team offense but dangelo distracted enofe even swiping at his legsin front of the ref joseph said donovan is now legal so ill go with that from here donovan hit a hard irish whip on enofe into their corner then tagged in lorenzo stacks cinched in a modified sitting arm lock as they showed legado del fantasma in the back escobar appeared then said its time to go to the ring stacks slapped enofe who slapped him back then they traded punches enofe was able to get the better of stacks with a leaping knee then tagged in blade who slipped on a springboard yet was still able to make some contact he clotheslined two dimes over to the outside then climbed the top rope for a crossbody on stacks for a twocount joseph is calling them by their nicknames and not their ring names blade hit a backslide and then a big leaping sunset flip for a twocount before hitting a leg lariattwo dimes took out enofe at ringside shoving him into the post stacks hit a big clothesline to take out blade but both men were down ldf appeared at ringside as two dimes tagged in and they hit a double punch and double running kick for the victory winner troy two dimes donovan  channing stacks lorenzo at 610 running double kick dangelo took a mic and yelled for ldf to get in the ring and do this they obliged as the men paired off with each other literally all of the nxt referees and some office people came out to separate the two groups wes lee was in the back with mckenzie mitchell who said she cant believe hes still standing here after what happened last week she asked about challenging sanga and he said he was running off adrenaline and even after that wore off he doesnt think he made a mistake and he took it as disrespect mitchell said she doesnt think sanga meant any disrespect and lee said maybe not to you and even though he and her are friends she just doesnt understand what its like lee was making his entrance as they returned sanga made his before the break 2 sanga vs wes lee  singles match lee tried using his speed into a headlock and sunset flip but sanga just tossed him then gave lee maybe the biggest biel ive ever seen lees ribs are taped sanga then gave headbutts to the back of lees head then worked the midsection he stepped over the rope and drove his boot into lees chest unique sanga went outside and draped lee on the bottom rope hitting a big uppercut and then a 126 elbow sanga reentered the ring brushed off lees attacks and hit a knee to the ribs he applied a hold to the midsection but lee hit some back elbows to break the hold he kicked the knee then punched and kicked the leg he hit a rolling capoeira kick to send sanga outside then hit some kicks through the ropes including a slingshot double stomp to the back he then hit a shotgun dropkick to sanga forcing him into the steps however sanga dropped him with one big slap across the chest then reentered the ring lee hit some kicks and an enziguri from the corner then climbed to the top sanga dodged and hit a massive clothesline that flipped lee sanga then hit a chokeslam that folded lee up like spike dudley for the victory winner sanga at 351 chokeslam after the match xyon quinn in his vampirechic leather getup and shades entered the ring he approached lee but sanga came in and tossed quinn away quinn tried a sneak attack but backed off as sanga had his arm around lee in the locker room cora jade hyped up rozanne perez about her semifinal match with lash legend they brought up perezs match with jenna waters i guess and how she took it to waters jade apparently hit waters with her skateboard too they cut to break hyping elektra lopez vs alba fyre hazelwoods take i still cant tell the difference between donovan and lorenzo but im guessing itll come with time remember when the crowd chanted which ones dash which ones dawson thats me right now with those two i wasnt overly impressed with them but its still early  and im a huge fan of enofe and his selling was great in the match ive said multiple times i would have lee keep losing singles matches that he doesnt shy away from until he finds that thing that separates singles wrestling from tag team wrestling and they were on the right track i just hope they dont put him in a team with sanga and sanga is just there to support him against quinn they returned with guru raj and someone i dont recognize telling bron breakker that they saw joe gacys guys in his locker room it was from earlier today breakker barged into the locker room breathing heavily then saw a polaroid on the lockers of his family from 20 years ago lopez was already in the ring as they cut back to the ring fyre made her entrance next and since i missed last week im not sure if her hair and makeup and gear are new or were there last week she blew out the fire on her bat as she walked to the ring 3 elektra lopez vs alba fyre  singles match they showed jade sitting front row hard camera side as the two locked up and went outside against the announce table lopez used her strength to throw fyre into the apron and then back inside fyre responded with a dropkick and kick for a onecount wade barrett said jade could watch in the back on a monitor like everyone else lopez responded by attacking the arm hitting a big arm wringer that sent fyre into the mat then rammed her shoulderfirst into the turnbuckle she pointed out jade before going after fyre fyre dodged attacks and hit some slaps to the chest then a superkick she went for her finisher but couldnt lift her with the damage to the left arm lopez hit a running knee into the corner but fyre then rolled her up for a twocount hit a superkick a glasgow kiss and climbed for the swanton fyre hit for the victory winner alba fyre at 253 swanton fyre quickly made her way up the ramp lopez exited the ring and knocked the popcorn from jades hand and berated her jade played it off like whatever they showed damon kemp in the back on the phone with someone the creed brothers and ivy nile appeared and kemp said management told him the match is off because roderick strong rolled his ankle julius said it doesnt matter how hurt you are you tape it up and compete a recipe for disaster really kemp said hes not here to get in the middle of anything and just here to follow orders brutus said pretty deadly always gets lucky but julius said their luck will run out at the next ple which the name of is escaping me right now they cut to break hazelwoods take another short match but what it should be with lopez still being so green she was better here but you could still see those spots where fyre had to coach her into doing sequences fyres presentation is great but i think she should change her finisher as she doesnt really land the swanton well the ple isin your house thanks to kelly for the quick tip they came back with an announcement forcrown jewel mitchell was in the back with fallon henley as mitchell said nikkita lyons had to withdraw from the tournament with an injury giving fallon henley a bye joshua briggs and brooks jensen were there as well tiffany stratton approached and berated henley for taking the easy way out and said henley didnt earn her spot henley said she earned her spot in everything shes done and said yeehaw bitch and told her to make the match official with management perez made her entrance first getting a full entrance legend was in the ring already damn 4 lash legend vs roxanne perez  semifinals match in the womens breakout tournament legend immediately rushed perez and threw her off after a wheelbarrow attempt perez hit a gobehind but legend picked the leg perez went for an arm drag and another but legend lifted her and hit an inverted suplex followed by a kip up legend lifted perez into a canadian backbreaker but perez slipped out only to eat some gut knees legend then lifted perez into a delayed butterfly backbreaker for a twocount legends power moves are looking good tonight legend went for another canadian backbreaker but perez countered into a sleeper legend after some struggle rammed perez into the corner perez followed with basement dropkicks to both knees then a running thesz press perez hit a running uppercut then another into the corner but legend caught her and basically hit a standing stroke jeff jarretts finisher legend went for a powerbomb but perez hit the sunset bomb for the victory i think joseph called it pop rock winner roxanne perez at 320 sunset bomb to advance to the finals of the womens breakout tournament mandy rose with toxic attraction was walking in the back and they discussed how indi hartwell calling her out was the biggest mistake of her life suddenly kayden carter and katana chance attacked them taking out the womens tag team champion as rose made her way to the ring hazelwoods take the first match went over six minutes but the next three didnt surpass four the two womens matches were short but probably needed to be with the inexperience of lopez and legend legend looked in my estimation the best she has in nxt tonight perez being the folly worked well with legends power offense perez is polished but the crowd doesnt seem to be behind her as much for some reason they never indicated if stratton would take lyons place or if its just a regular match with henley so its either going to be henely vs perez or the winner of henleystratton vs perez in the final hartwell made her entrance first as they returned looking confident it also seems like fightful select reported that strattonhenley is a semifinal match rose made her entrance next sans her cronies the camera work during her entrance isnot subtle at all 5 mandy rose c vs indi hartwell  nontitle match hartwell hit a shoulder tackle and wrenched the left arm lots of working the arm tonight rose hit the ropes then a back elbow and gut knee using the hair to slam hartwell to mat drawing admonishment from referee da brewer rose then worked hartwells left arm she whipped hartwell into the corner hit a running corner attack a snapmare and pk to the back for a twocount rose hit a series of body kicks to hartwell in the corner then shoulder thrusts hartwell reversed a whip and hit a modified snake eyes then some shortarm clotheslines she caught rose into a sidewalk slam for a twocount rose rolled outside as they cut to the first break during a match tonight the usa player briefly showed splitscreen before going to full commercial nxt

downloadstream the full postshow recording recaps from last week focused on gunthers fasttrack to an nxt title loss before his promotion heading into the ahem highconcept stuff with joe gacy harland and rick steiner 1 cameron grimes c vs solo sikoa  north american championship match good reaction for sikoa with a few boos mixed in given his opposition lots of people yelling to the moon as alicia taylor introduced grimes grimes took sikoa to a rope then rolled him up for two reversal and two for sikoa reset and cheers arm drag into an armbar by grimes quickly escaped into a head scissors by sikoa escape and an armbar by grimes to a corner another arm drag into an armbar by grimes grimes transitioned to an arm submission and sikoa finally powered out and hit a shoulder block and then another senton by sikoa quick reversals and grimes tried a cave in and sikoa slid away another reset solo chant the two shook hands grimes said i respect youbut your bloodline can kiss my grits to an ooooohhhh from the crowd sikoa fired up and beat grimes from corner to corner sikoa hit a lariat to clear grimes to the outside then followed and tossed him back stepup enzuigiri by grimes to send sikoa out followed by a pk and a rolling senton heading to splitscreen sikoa had grimes grounded but grimes hit an arm drag to break forearm exchange was won by sikoa charge into the corner by sikoa and a second charge missed grimes hit a rana then ran the ropes and hit a clothesline deadlift german got two for grimes solo chant as the crowd has been about 7030 in his favor grimes charged a corner and sikoa dragged him into the corner then hit a hip attack in the corner for a long two grimes blocked an attempt at a samoan drop and the two exchanged shots grimes missed from the top then hit his twisting slam for two grimes went for the cave in and sikoa lifted him for a samoan drop and covered for a very long two sikoa went up to the top and grimes followed sikoa pushed grimes off and then trick williams showed up and distracted sikoa who splashed him on the outside sikoa walked into a cave in for the grimes victory sikoa and grimes tried to fight off williams and a charging carmelo hayes but the fresh men won the exchange hayes grabbed the belt and then he and williams posed to hayes music winner cameron grimes at 1309 wellss analysis excellent tv match that really gave sikoa some believable nearfalls and probably was justified in having the interference as an out for him wild that the nxt audience have taken so completely to sikoa in such a small amount of time but if the worker is up to the task a nononsense badass usually works the screen ran down the five teams for tonights gauntlet match grayson waller  sanga spoke to the camera from backstage well waller spoke waller said he was going to stand there and look pretty while sanga earned his keep in the gauntlet match malcolm bivens and the creeds cut a promo on pretty deadly and the rest of the field brutus is finding some fire on the mic juliusis trying theres time bivens was awesome as always earlier today the creeds drew their gauntlet number from a tumbler a la the royal rumble julius picked the number looked at it and said we wouldnt want it any other way bron breakker headed to the ring in a tank and jeans he said joe gacy wanted to get his attention and he did he said his dad was home safe and sound now but gacy has some nerve messing with his family and especially his father a legend in the business he yelled that gacy should get to the ring and see who the big guy is when theyre standing in front of each other gacy showed up on the tron in front of a fire outside he apologized for not being able to be there gacy said now he understood why bron was so strong because rick took his beating like a man he said breakker may have freed his father but he left behind a memento his hall of fame ring he said a family can only be tested by fire and he tossed the ring into the flame and laughed hysterically that was it for the segment as the show awkwardly just transitioned to a video package on the womens division mckenzie mitchell interviewed toxic attraction as they held all their gold in their little cabana mandy rose said dakota kai had a lot of voices in her head but none were telling her that she would be taking the title backstage jacket time were firing up forsomething and von wagner attacked them and destroyed them with the environment robert stone walked into the frame smiled and said looks like theres no match tonight moments ago bron breakker told an interviewer to get the mic out of his face and he got in his car and drove off robert stone and von wagner were in the ring stone said it looks like jacket time ran out of time and well never see jacket time again because this is von wagners world and were just living in it ikemen jiro hit the ring selling pain in his side but got the better of wagner and said ikemen is pissed the match was on 2 ikemen jiro vs von wagner jiro got in a few more shots but wagner hit a hard lariat and some elbow drops irish whip and a fallaway slam by wagner wagner put up jiro in a bear hug but jiro escaped and got in a few more rights dropkick by jiro and a superkick jiro went up and hit a swanton bomb for two jiro kipped up but ran right into a big boot wagner hit his finisher once again the pretty woman from the crowd got wagners attention she pointed at wagner to cause more harm stone told him to ignore her wagner grabbed jiro and threw him from the ring into the front and second row of the crowd into a waiting sea of clear pc trainees winner von wagner at 256 wellss analysis just the right type of match to get wagner over further and also continues the tv feud between wagner and jacket time mckenzie mitchell interviewed nikkita lyons for about fifteen seconds at which point lash legend flew in with a boot to lay out lyons as she was cutting a promo on legend during the break ikemen jiro got some medical attention after the big spot pretty deadly  kit wilson and elton prince  had their vignette ahead of the gauntlet match they laid their act on thick and it was great we also saw them pick their numbers from the tumbler and they were thrilled id say just about everyone has figured out how this entire gauntlet will go now 3 dakota kai vs mandy rose c wjacy jayne  gigi dolin  nxt womens championship match kais introduction criminally happened during the break decent heat for mandy rose with a brief chant from the usual deep voices lockup was won by kai who took rose to a corner and shoved her repeatedly into the buckle mandy threw an awkward boot to lay out kai then hit a body slam and toxic attraction cheered huge for the small spot rose kicked kai in a corner then dragged kais face along the top rope body slam blocked and kai hit a crucifix that was slow as rose forgot to put her far arm into it corner rollup by kai for two arm drag by kai and another dropkick by kai rope run and jayne tried to mess with kai but kai dumped rose to the floor then splashed all three of toxic attraction as the match went to commercial and kai got a heros closeup previous

commentsquestionspwtorchnxtgmailcom if you dont listen live download or stream the full show postrecording 3 roxanne perez vs tiffany stratton  womens breakout tournament finals alicia taylor handled formal intros both got strong intended reactions perez worked a headlockearly stratton pulled her hair to break rope run and a trip by stratton she knocked down perez and posed perez worked a twisting rana and stratton landed on her feet dropkick followed by a trip by perez perez wrenched strattons arm a corner graphic promoted a handicap match between solo sikoa and grayson waller  carmelo hayes stratton worked perezs arm and grounded her adding a knee on the throat perez got some hope spots before stratton grounded her again roxy finally wriggled free she countered a slam into a rana and hit a corner forearm the two exchanged arm wrenches irish whip and a corner elbow by perez perez went up for a move in the corner and stratton tossed her to the outside the match went to commercial with no splitscreen stratton had an arm submission on roxy but roxy rolled stratton up to break stratton went back to the arm hold and perez unconvincingly teased a tap perez was able to roll up stratton again for two jockeying for position in the corner where stratton got the better of it and hit a somersault corner backsplash then covered for two roxanne tried a monkey flip and got turned around she did a little ground and pound then hit a tope on the retreating stratton she rolled stratton in and hit a russian leg sweep for two standing senton got two and stratton went into a crucifix for two powerslam by stratton got two stratton tried to go up and perez held on stratton tried a moonsault that mostly missed and perez hit pop rox to finish after the decision cora jade hit the ring to celebrate with perez winner roxanne perez at 1219 wellss analysis they got more comfortable near the end but this was slow and clunky almost all the way through i dont know if the two just dont click or what was happening but it just wasnt sharp toxic attractions music hit to throw cold water on the segment mandy rose labored through some mic time and mockingly said perez should be proud of herself she told her to enjoy the moment because its all downhill from here she said if she thinks perez is going to cash in this contract on her shes got a better chance of just going to raw or smackdown or just hanging it up she told her not to bother she started going after jade verbally and jade went at her a brawl erupted indi hartwell hit the ring to even the numbers and the faces took over to cheers backstage bodhi hayward had been attacked andre chase checked on him and he confirmed he was attacked by pretty deadly mckenzie mitchell tried to interview wendy choo and tiffany stratton intervened she wouldnt let wendy have any mic time so choo tossed her drink in her face stratton threw a tantrum 4 andre chase vs pretty deadly elton prince  kit wilson handicap apparently chase hit the ring and cleared house early numbers caught up to him and pretty deadly dominated him in their corner they had chase on the mat and bodhi hayward attempted to crawl to the ring thea hail stopped him and then went to the face corner herself to cheers her appearance fired up chase who got the better of wilson and he did his chaseu taunt and stomp immediately after prince made a blind tag and the two hit their finisher well they at leastteased a moment of intergender action winners pretty deadly at 316 wellss analysis more of an angle than a match pretty deadly gets their heat back sort of though i suspect their time in nxt is fairly short at this point backstage tony dangelo and his two goons ran into carmelo hayes and trick williams they had an awkward exchange and d called hayes son and warned him to stay out of his way alba fyre entered ahead of her match 5 alba fyre vs tatum paxley quick reversals to open paxley rolled fyre up for two waistlock takedown by fyre and a crucifix for two reset paxley shot in for a takedown and a two count fyre hit a knee strike to paxleys jaw for two fyre reversed an irish whip and paxley went hard to the corner gory bomb by fyre she went up paxley rolled a bit further away fyre shrugged and just hit her flying senton from farther away to finish as fyre left up the ramp legend laid her out but the camera cut away before anything could come of it winner alba fyre at 238 wellss analysis sentons look like they make very little contact more often than not and someone as stiff and mean as fyre should have a better finisher backstage diamond mine commiserated roderick strong did some damage control edris enofe and malik blade applauded as they entered the room they made a challenge julius faked a threat against them and then smiled and shook hands with them and agreed to a match after blade and enofe left strong took them to task for agreeing to the match saying its not christmas he said he was going to allow them one mistake as champions and that was it strong left and the rest of diamond mine watched him go a vignette narrated by an italian woman hyped the debut of giovanni vinci the former fabian aichner thats roughly the same as turning an interesting american name into john smith 6 solo sikoa vs carmelo hayes  grayson waller wtrick williams solo said as bad as he wants to kick some asses right now he brought someone who feels the same way apollo crewss music hit to turn this into a tag match sikoa and hayes opened but hayes tagged waller before the anticipated pairoff sikoa dominated with power he took down waller with a headbutt and tagged crews who came in with a rolling senton he held waller in a delayed suplex and the crowd counted to 30 before he hit it vic said this was crews first nxt match since 2016 sikoa tagged in and hit a diving headbutt to wallers midsection and covered for two crews tagged in again rope run and a back elbow by waller blind tag and hayes flew in with his twisting ddttype move he postured a little and tagged waller back in waller stomped crews in the corner then slammed him and flexed he took crews to the heel corner and tagged and he and hayes took turns striking crews hayes jawed at sikoa and went back to business crews tried to power his way to his corner and melo thwarted him until crews hit a thrustkick waller tagged and sikoa made the hot tag hip attack by sikoa the heels bailed and crews hit them both with a plancha as the match went to splitscreen previous article next article related articles njpw battle in the valley report 113

report august 9 2022 winter park fla at the capitol wrestling center aired live on usa network report by kelly wells spookymilk pwtorch contributor nxt commentators vic joseph wade barrett tonight

commentsquestionspwtorchnxtgmailcom if you dont listen live download or stream the full show postrecording last weeks recap centered on the fourway for the vacant womens tag team championships trick williams promoted the rounds match hell be part of tonight and wes lee had a short counter as well cora jade zoey stark and tony dangelo all got a moment to promote their matches the gimmick of the segment was that each wrestler would cover the camera with their hand at the end of their segment and the edit would reveal the next person decent idea 1 nikkita lyons vs kiana james james perhaps the owner of the most hamfisted gimmick on the brand faces the most confused gimmick on the brand lyons is still doing all the lipsynching and the roar despite how bad her entrance remains both wrestlers shoved the other to start lyons swatted james then missed a charge and james thumped her on the back of the knee with a stomp james wrenched lyonss leg over the apron then tried again but got shoved lyons charged james at the steps but james moved and lyons sold the bad knee back inside james worked the knee of lyons by cranking her leg around jamess own lyons tried to get back into it with forearms and kicks german suplex by lyons was better than in the past corner splash by lyons who covered for two james broke by grabbing a rope james tried to roll up lyons and use the ropes but got caught lyons hit a spin kick and her splits finisher to win after the match james brained lyons with her briefcase winner nikkita lyons at 411 wellss analysis lyons is improving albeit slowly in the ring whats strange is that her entrance is a laughable mess and her splits finisher doesnt look like it causes any impact but theyre plowing through with both like they arent things to work on the match was free of sloppy moments which was no given with these two at this stage of their careers so it should be considered a win the creed brothers and apollo crews were watching film from last week roderick strong showed up to ask why they were together the creeds wanted to know where roddy was last week roddy said his absence was a test and the creeds called him a liar the scene devolved until a match was made pitting crews against strong for tonight backstage lash legend accosted malik blade and talked his ear off aboutnothing really 2 wes lee vs trick williams wtrick williams  british rounds match alicia taylor explained the rules of the match both guys had boxing gloves on so it isnt exactly the same as the usual round one began dancing around to start williams begged off to his corner a couple of times lee backed away from a few shots and the two connected a few times williams took down lee for some ground and pound why the gloves back to their feet the two exchanged shots williams took lee to a corner for repeated shots and lee reversed and did the same williams struck a few more times but lee took williams apart and was about to knock him out as the round ended after the twentysecond rest period ended both guys threw their gloves off lee dumped williams and hit a plancha lee tossed williams back inside and hayes held back lee long enough for williams to get a pump kick in he covered for the three to win the second round the twenty second rest period started and the match went to splitscreen during the break time expired on the third round with no decision rendered round four started without commercials trick had put on one glove most likely loaded trick reversed an irish whip williams missed a few shots and lee managed a crucifix for the win to tie 11 williams struck with his loaded glove to knock lee out after the decision and for some reason wasnt disqualified the fifth round started and williams hit big moves for lastmoment kickouts by lee vertical suplex then another by williams cover for two williams covered again and again williams missed a spin kick and got hung up on the top rope so lee nailed him with an enzuigiri lee threw body shots and a european uppercut bulldog by lee lee threw on his glove threw a big haymaker and got the win at two falls to one with no sixth round necessary winner wes lee at 1242 including rest periods wellss analysis the boxing bits werent particularly thrilling but at least the gloves figured into two important spots competent match that feels like it could be a lot more down the road as williams continues to improve andre chase was talking to arianna grace about something she had a problem with apparently she got hit with a football to the face from thea hail hail showed up and got super excited chase told them to settle their differences with a match tonight grace said she was thinking more about a lawsuit and chase threw a fit and cursed as usual hail jumped up and down and overacted a lot carmelo hayes came out to talk about his north american open challenge lsat week where he turned back nathan frazer hayes stared at the tron as nathan frazers music played angle on hayes as giovanni vinci appeared behind him and posed to the camera he said he would take care of nathan frazer when the time was right but in the meantime he asked for hayes to open up the challenge again for heatwave hayes said they could do it at heatwave but hell put him on a tshirt he was wearing a shirt made to look like wes lee crying the two started to go at it and refs broke them up hype segment for jd mcdonagh vs bron breakker both guys sat and created soundbytes in between shots of them brawling over the past few weeks set to music the segment ended with mcdonagh smirking as breakker looked at his bloody hand during the contract signing last week lash legend was still boring malik blade about her previous matches as edris enofe showed up and got trapped in the same situation 3 thea hail wandre chase vs arianna grace hail took down grace a couple of times with tosses grace caught and darted hail into a corner then rammed her face intoit again judo throw by grace followed by her shoving hails face into the mat hail covered up as grace went for some ground and pound the audience was cheering a lot for hail hail threw a kick to the back of graces head for a moments respite but grace went to an armbar grace continued to grind against hails face with her arm hail stood up with grace on her back then slammed backward to finally break hail tookdown grace with chops then hit a corner splash and another basement dropkick by hail followed by a neckbreaker she shook the ropes and yepped like ultimate warrior hail hit a standing moonsault sort of for two hail threw a right and the ref got in between them grace used the opening to hit wasteland which obviously thrilled wade barrett winner arianna grace at 348 wellss analysis this company has a bundle of energy whos naturally lovable in hail and whether its her ties to the defineddown chase u or not having anyone in her corner yet shes now 01 as they desperately try to force nikkita lyons down our throats as a babyface conqueror comparisons to alexa bliss could be natural for thea hail and like bliss i think she has real potential thats thus far untapped the match came together decently though graces offense will get smoother cameron grimes and solo sikoa talked in the back sikoa tried relating to grimes as he worked his bad knee grimes gave a basic okay solo in the end and sikoa watched him walk off 4 apollo crews vs roderick strong the announcers mentioned diamond mine not showing up in strongs corner headlock takeover by strong reversed into a wristlock by crews wastlock standing switch and a waistlock takedown by crews crews tried a front chancery but strong escaped and yanked crewss arm headlock takedown by strong crews used a headscissors to take control and roddy twisted around to escape and swatted crews on the back of the head strong begged off in the corner as crews charged reset crews yanked strongs arm and slapped at his head a few times to cheers and one guy being sure to be heard booing strong grappled crews to the mat crews escaped rope run and crews hit a dropkick then threw some corner shots and a chop then another roddy threw a forearm to crewss back followed by his wonderful backbreaker the two exchanged shots and chops another backbreaker by strong strong charged crews in a corner crews shoved him off then went up for a flying move but strong dropkicked him out of the air crews went to the apron and the two fought for position roddy spilled to the apron and tried something there strong couldnt manage a sunset flip from the apron so he instead yanked crews from the apron to take control heading into commercial strong controlled with a neck hold he released when crews didnt tap and crews hit a delayed suplex crews went high but strong shoved him off the top strong worked an abdominal stretch grounding crews crews threw body blows and strong charged and missed in the corner repeated lariats by crews laid strong out crews kipped up and was mostly cheered secondrope blockbuster by crews got two this is awesome chant crews hit a german suplex then held on for a second strong fought off a third with elbows but he unwittingly jumped into a third anyway crews covered for two strong dumped crews to the apron then hit him with a flash knee strong went to the apron and nailed crews with a backdrop crews landed poorly after clipping himself on the rope on the way down back inside roddy covered for two boston crab by strong crews escaped and shoved off strong who bailed to the outside then ran in and charged right into a powerslam by crews crews tried a gorilla press but strong caught him with a backbreaker strong jumped at crews who managed a lungblower crews nailed strong with his finisher winner apollo crews at 1527 wellss analysis no surprise that this was one of the best matches all year on nxt tv of course both guys have the inring part of things figured out its the work outside of the ring that continues to need development back to legend blade and enofe enofe finally tried to stop legend from talking and she threw a minifit pretty deadly showed up and took her side and said not to worry  theyd mop the floor with them next valentina feroz and yulisa leon complained to sanga about their loss last week and asked for advice katana chance and kayden carter showed up and said theyd be fighting champions and when the time was right theyd be ready for them the champs left sanga said leon and feroz remind him of chance and carter who never gave up and now theyre champions he said next week they can join him to find balance the creeds and damon kemp watched film to find whatever apollo crews warned them about during their eightman roderick strong stormed in and demanded to know where they were during his match brutus quipped it was a test you passed julius got in strongs face and said he was going to watch the film again to be sure but if he was right hed be dealing with someone real soon santos escobar vs tony dangelo  the final accord the two met outside at a table both made sure the other came along d said he was the boss and he dictates things escobar said d must know by now that it wasnt going to work d said escobar could do the hard work in his ivory tower with his pride but look where it got him d said he called the meeting to get escobars head on straight because it was still up his ass escobar said the only reason d is the don is because he sent ciampa packing he said there would be one final match next week  d wins and escobar leaves nxt d said if he wins he also keeps escobars sheep if escobar wins everyone is free dangelo made it a street fight ugh they made the deal and shook hands d told escobar to say goodbye to his legados a drone shot watched the two step away from the table good work by both guys here tiffany stratton went to her dressing room where she entered and wendy choo was behind her with nightvision goggles she turned off the light and beat stratton with a chair then turned on the light and left so choo is back to committing crimes again 5 edris enofe  malik blade vs pretty deadly elton prince  kit wilson enofe and blade made quick tags early to dominate prince prince fought off blade and wilson managed a european uppercut for two prince tagged back in for a tandem lungblower for two pretty deadly did their roll tide taunt and posed outside the ring behind them josh briggs brooks jensen and fallon henley showed up their poor feelings apparently hurt they stood outside the ring and enofe managed a flying elbow on wilson for two broken up by prince prince shoved a chair into the ring but he got laid out on the outside wilson tried to use the chair and briggs took it from him but wilson shoved enofe into the chair and it also hit the rednecks on the rebound fallon henley checked on her boys and lash legend jumped and assaulted her winners pretty deadly at 436 wellss analysis some decent action at times but a ton of moving parts to move stories forward cameron grimes tried to leave the building and someone tried to rile him up he fought the urge to fight with the help of the doorman joe gacy and dyad showed up and gacy asked where grimes was going grimes said he was going home gacy said to who and grimes looked at him and left gacy laughed a video package recapped the tag fourway last week gigi dolin and jacy jayne narrated about losing and said when you lose something so big you can either wallow or rebel jayne went to a record store and talked about her love of rock music while picking up a copy of zeppelin iv dolin went to a bar downed a drink and threw the glass down im not sure what the scene was to signify but it was well produced and the women spoke their lines well mckenzie mitchell wearing a hair extension that went below her midsection tried to interview apollo crews grayson waller showed up and got into his face and they jawed their way to a probable match next week waller is in a weird position where his appearances almost all involve him interrupting someone else 6 zoey stark vs cora jade vic tried to introduce mandy rose on commentary but wade took over this experiment didnt go overly well next time jade shoved stark who blocked jade to the mat rollup by jade and another two by stark arm drags by stark and jade begged off into the ropes jade stomped stark and covered for one the announcers almost completely ignored the match as they talked about roses reign waistlock takedown by stark then another and the crowd went into a loud dueling chant that was probably 6065 stark springboard senton by stark got two jade stopped a charging stark by grabbing her hair and she threw her to the mat as the match went to splitscreen previous article next article

welcomed us to the show 1 valentina feroz wyulisa leon vs arianna grace grace took feroz down to the mat early as feroz rolled through grabbing the arm of grace grace would use her power to drop feroz onto the top rope and applied a tight sleeper hold feroz rolled up grace for a near fall to escape and hit a lou thesz press mounted with punches and a spear for the comeback grace kicked the arm of feroz attempted a scoop slam but was caught in a backslide by feroz who picked up the pinfall victory valentina feroz defeated arianna grace via pinfall in 415 the commentary team hyped sloane jacobs as in action after the break johns ramblings nice win for feroz over grace both ladies looked smooth in there as their development continues 2 sloane jacobs vs sierra st pierre the commentary team put over jacobs recent appearance in the nxt breakout tournament as she hit st pierre with a dropkick early followed by a side headlock jacobs hit a crossbody for a near fall before taking st pierre down once more with another headlock st pierre responded with punches to the face of jacobs and applied a chinlock st pierre sent jacobs into the corner and hit a forearm before jacobs countered with a double arm suplex followed by a knee strike clothesline and a flapjack for the win sloane jacobs defeated sierra st pierre via pinfall in 454 the commentary team hyped the main event johns ramblings a showcase win for sloane jacobs and for an originally unannounced opponent sierra st pierre got in more offense than i expected that she would have the crowd was into this one providing us with dueling chants 3 dante chen vs ikemen jiro tie up by both men as chen took the early advantage before jiro countered with a roll up for the near fall both men traded pinfall attempts to a stalemate chen hit a lungblower and followed up with a shoulder block on jiro to take control chen continued to work on the upper body of jiro driving him to the mat as jiro attempted to escape jiro responded with a series of jacket punches and a springboard splash on chen for a two count chen dropped jiro onto his knee but jiro fought through and hit the knee to the face of chen to finish it ikemen jiro defeated dante chen via pinfall in 701 johns ramblings another week another loss for chen but expected if they are rebuilding ikemen jiro after the departure of kushida jiro doesnt connect with me personally
