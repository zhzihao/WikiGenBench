The regular season began on March 11, 2023 and was originally scheduled to end on September 30, 2023, but got postponed to October 3, 2023. The playoffs began on October 6, 2023.\n\nThe league took two breaks during the regular season, during Holy Week and during the Philippines' co-hosting of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\n\nThis season features 29 teams, with five teams returning to the league alongside two expansion teams: the Negros Muscovados and the Quezon Huskers.\n\nThe opening ceremonies took place at the Quezon Convention Center in Lucena, Quezon. The 2023 MPBL All-Star Game was held at Bataan People's Center in Balanga, Bataan, where the North Division beat the South Division for the first time with a score of 99–91.\n\nOKBet continued to be the league's title sponsor up until the regular season. In October 2023, Nexus88 Gaming became the new title sponsor of the league, with Arena Plus also becoming the league's official sportsbook partner.\n\nTeams\n\nTeam changes \n\nThis season featured two expansion teams: the Negros Muscovados making its first regular season appearance after competing in the 2021 Invitational, and the Quezon Huskers making its first league appearance altogether. Five teams also made their return to the league, which includes the Bicol Volcanoes, Bulacan Kuyas, Iloilo United Royals, Parañaque Patriots and Pasay Voyagers. This increased the total number of teams from 22 teams in 2022 to 29 teams in 2023.\n\nEvery returning team is allocated to its previous division, while both Negros and Quezon are placed in the South Division. The Rizal Golden Coolers were realigned back to the North Division.\n\nArenas \n\n Notes\n  Only used for the 2023 Preseason Invitational.\n  Despite the presence of the Manila Stars, the arena was not used by the team during the season.\n\nName changes\n The Batangas City Embassy Chill temporarily changed its name to Batangas City Tanduay Rum Masters during the 2023 Preseason Invitational.\n The Imus City Bandera changed its name to Imus SV Squad before the 2023 Preseason Invitational.\n The Bacolod Bingo Plus changed its name to Bacolod City of Smiles before the start of the season.

The tournament ran for one week from February 21–27, 2023 at the Lagao Gymnasium in General Santos, the home arena of the GenSan Warriors.\n\nThe tournament was won by the Zamboanga Family's Brand Sardines after beating the Nueva Ecija Rice Vanguards in the final game with a score of 88–80, with Dexter Maiquez winning MVP honors.\n\nOpening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony was held on March 11, 2023 at Quezon Convention Center in Lucena, Quezon. Rapper Andrew E. and singer Marcelito Pomoy were both among the performers to kick off the regular season. Like previous seasons, a muse contest followed wherein some teams took part in.\n\nThe first game was between the Rizal Golden Coolers and the Bataan Risers, while the first home game featured the two expansion teams this season, with the Quezon Huskers hosting the Negros Muscovados.\n\nRegular season\n\nFormat \nThe 29 teams play in a single round-robin format, playing one game against all other teams in the league for a total of 28 games. In each gameday, a series of games is played in a designated home arena, with the home team usually playing in the final game.\n\nThe top eight teams in each division will advance to a four-round, single-elimination playoffs, playing in best-of-three series in the first three rounds, and a best-of-five series in the National Finals, with homecourt advantage alternating between the higher seeds of each series in the first two rounds.\n\nPostponed and cancelled games \n The Bacoor City–Bataan and Quezon–Marikina games, originally scheduled for September 22, 2023 at Marikina Sports Center, were postponed due to health concerns brought by volcanic smog. Both were then postponed to October 3, 2023, while the venue remained unchanged.\n The Laguna–Manila game, also originally scheduled for September 22, 2023, was later cancelled due to it having no effect on playoff standings.\n\nStandings\n\nNorth Division\n\nSouth Division\n\nResults \n\nNot all games are in home–away format. Each team plays every team once. Number of asterisks after each score denotes number of overtimes played.
