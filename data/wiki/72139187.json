{"id": 72139187, "key": "Aliens: Dark Descent", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens%3A%20Dark%20Descent", "text": "Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time tactics video game developed by Tindalos Interactive in collaboration with Disney's 20th Century Games and published by Focus Entertainment. Set in the Alien universe, the game was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on June 20, 2023. It received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\nGameplay\nThe Dark Descent story is set in the year 2198, 19 years after the events of the original trilogy films. It is a real-time tactics video game played from a top-down perspective. Players need to issue commands to a squad of four colonial marines, who must battle the Xenomorphs and rogue agents from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. The game features five starting character classes, each with their own unique weapons and abilities. While combat happens in real time, players can briefly slow time to a crawl in order to issue commands or set up an ambush. Players are encouraged to explore the moon station, discovering short cuts and deploying motion trackers which allows players to track alien movements. They can also use a welder to open locked doors, and can weld doors shut as they retreat from one room to another. The changes to level layout are permanent. Welding a door may stop the Xenomorphs from advancing, but it may also block the player's route in subsequent visits.\n\nBetween missions, players can upgrade and customize their marines. Players need to maintain not only the physical health but also the mental health of these characters. Each character has their own mental traits. Their combat performance may be affected if they were put under too much strain. They may miss their shots, behave irrationally, or even sabotage the player's mission. Squad members may die permanently after being attacked. Players can evacuate during a mission to prevent losing the entire squad. According to the developer, each mission in the game lasts \"anywhere between 20 minutes and an hour\".\n\nStory\nIn the year 2198, on the moon of Lethe, the USS Otago prepares for a shakedown. Meanwhile, at Pioneer Station, a shuttle, the Bentonville, drops off cargo. A mysterious infiltrator releases its contents: deadly Xenomorph aliens, which begin to massacre the crew. Noticing Bentonville's cargo weight discrepancy, Deputy Administrator Maeko Hayes recommends the ship be detained but her supervisor McDonald refuses. Hayes encounters the aliens in the docking bay, trying to weld the doors shut. As the shuttle leaves, McDonald and the control staff are attacked and impregnated by facehuggers. Narrowly escaping, Hayes realizes more Xenomorphs are in Bentonville's remaining cargo and reluctantly activates the Cerberus Protocol, a Weyland-Yutani planetary quarantine procedure using armed satellites. Bentonville and a freighter, Baldrin, are destroyed with all hands while the Otago is crippled. Hayes is extracted by Sgt. Jonas Harper and his squad of Colonial Marines to the crash-landed Otago, where he takes command and deputizes Hayes as his Intelligence officer. The Marines enter the Dead Hills settlement, killing a Xenomorph Queen under the colony. After scouting the Berkley's Docks spaceport for parts to repair the Otago, the Marines encounter Darwin Era, an anti-Weyland-Yutani cult who revere the Xenomorphs as a higher stage of evolution. Upon returning, Hayes admits to Harper that she activated Cerberus; despite this, they continue to work together. Hayes also works with chief medical officer Bookard, Weyland-Yutani xenobiologist Becker, chief engineer Corrigan, ship psychologist Kabiri, and armory head Sgt. Martinez to find materials and personnel in the field to bring to Otago.\n\nHarper traces the origin of the Xenomorph containers to Olduvai, Lethe's main Trimonite refinery. In its mines, they encounter Guardians: modified cultists who are ignored by the Xenomorphs along with discovering the cult is taking people to the Cassandra Project. Harper briefly reminces on this \"Cassandra\", before Joseph Marlow, Darwin Era's leader and a former Weyland-Yutani scientist, addresses the Marines directly, inferring that Cassandra is working with him. Hayes, originally planning to use the Otago's last escape pod as a beacon to send out a distress call, instead uses it as an improvised missile to rescue the Marines just before they are overrun. Returning to the Otago, Harper discloses to Hayes that Cassandra is his daughter from his time on Lethe, as he was born on the planet. The Otago is directly attacked by Xenomorphs, but the Marines fight them off; Harper, who gets painful flashes and visions when Xenomorphs are nearby, begins to fall ill. Director Barbara Price, Weyland-Yutani's head of operations on Lethe, contacts the Marines and informs them that Cerberus is entering Phase 2: full nuclear sterilization of Lethe. The Marines storm Pioneer to try to stop Cerberus and kill another Queen, but it is too late to stop Cerberus. With little time, the Marines rush to repair Otago's hull, hypersleep chambers, and boost power to its energy shield to break the blockade. Price offers an atmospheric processor's power core, as well as looking for Cassandra and rescuing her from Marlow, in exchange for being allowed access to Otago.\n\nThe Marines raid the processor, stealing its core, killing another Queen, and recovering an APC, but Harper steadily weakens. The Marines then salvage a hypersleep gas-mixer chip from the USCSS Monterro, an old M-class vessel used during a prior rebellion against Weyland-Yutani for which Harper was present. A Guardian sneaks onboard Otago to persuade Harper to join Darwin Era, revealing that Marlow is using Cassandra for a project allowing communication with the Xenomorphs using her innate telepathic connection to the alien's hivemind, a trait that Harper shares with her and is the cause of his visions and failing health, before the Chestburster erupts from him and kills him. Harper confronts Price, who has dispatched men to find Cassandra, led by former Marine Theo Stern, in the Tantalus underground laboratory but Price had lost contact with them. The Marines infiltrate the lab and recover Stern, who joins the Marines, but they find from old footage that Cassandra has already been moved elsewhere to a new location and they narrowly escape the lab's self-destruct. During the escape, they capture Marlow who divulges that Price is playing them; she destroyed Tantalus and left Stern to die to tie up loose ends. Unable to get Cassandra's location from Marlow, Harper kills him after discovering that it to be a Synth recreation of the real Marlow, before falling unconscious.\n\nMeanwhile, back on Otago, Becker, working with Price to erase his debts to the company, cripples the ship's defenses and releases a Xenomorph Warrior that emerged from the captured Guardian, which kills Bookard while Weyland-Yutani commandos arrive to capture the ship. Hayes narrowly fends off the mercenaries with the ARC, though it is ruined by the commandos gunship; Becker gets the drop on her and holds her at gunpoint, but is killed by the Xenomorph. Hayes manages to lure the Xenomorph into the ship's reactor when it restarts, frying it and securing the ship. With Harper in critical condition and Kabiri unable to effectively treat him without Bookard, Stern and Hayes storm Pharos Spire, Weyland-Yutani's HQ on Lethe, to extract Marlow's location from Price. She divulges that Marlow has set up in an ancient alien city under Olduvai, which is where he is keeping Cassandra prisoner and desperately tries to bribe Hayes to take her with them. Disgusted, Hayes renounces Price as less human than a Synth and leaves her to die.\n\nAs Cerberus prepares to launch Phase 2, Hayes, determined to atone for serving Weyland-Yutani, decides to raid Marlow's city and save Cassandra. The now-repaired Otago takes to the air and the Marines launch an all-out assault on the mine, killing a Queen and many cultists. Hayes, Martinez, and Stern descend to and enter the underground city, which contains mummified remains of a giant, wormlike alien species and large Xenomorph eggs. They also discover the corpse of the real Marlow, who had died from a chestburster long ago, and countless non-hostile Marlow Synths he had created to continue his work on the Cassandra Project. Finding Cassandra and freeing her, a gargantuan Xenomorph made from one of the ancient aliens wakes up, killing Stern and Martinez. The women are cornered, but Harper uses the last of his strength to briefly immobilize the Xenomorph, allowing them to escape at the cost of his own life. The remaining Marines stay behind to hold off the endless swarming Xenomorphs while Hayes and Cassandra extract to Otago as the nuclear missiles start to fall. Otago's shields hold; the ship breaks the blockade and leaves Lethe's orbit. After mourning Harper, Hayes, Cassandra, and the remaining crew enter hypersleep as the Otago enters deep space.\n\nDevelopment\nDark Descent is developed by French studio Tindalos Interactive, which had previously developed the Battlefleet Gothic: Armada series of real-time strategy video game. According to managing director John Bert, the game was inspired by both tactical and computer role-playing games. The game was announced during Summer Game Fest in June 2022. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on June 20, 2023.\n\nReception\n\nAliens: Dark Descent received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nRock Paper Shotgun praised how the game recreated the atmosphere of Aliens, using elements of the franchise to help build tension, \"It's the first to really capture the white-knuckle vibe of setting up perimeters, quipping out that last line of top-tier banter you've been saving, and seeing the shapes on the motion tracker creep closer and squeal louder\". Eurogamer felt that the game didn't do anything to distinguish itself from other games inspired by XCOM: Enemy Unknown, \"Descent doesn't introduce any memorable mechanics or stylistic flourishes at the campaign level. It's as spare and utilitarian as the boxy grey architecture of the Otago itself\". While enjoying the Onslaught mechanic for increasing tension, IGN criticized the technical state of the game, writing, \"These issues are just a bit too frequent and a bit too game-breaking for me to look the other way\".\n\nGamesRadar+ thought the game added interesting, unique flourishes to the tactical game formula, especially the safe room mechanic, \"It's a brilliant and original feature that makes you stop and consider your squad of toughs as a little more human than just walking guns\". Game Informer disliked the game's controls, \"Unfortunately, stealth sections through packs of sleeping Xenomorphs make squad movement feel cumbersome. And at times, crouching and clicking other buttons aren't snappy, leading to deadly encounters with enemies\". PC Gamer liked the increasing infestation that progressed each day, saying that it made the player make hard choices, \"It's a fascinating mixture of ideas that creates tons of emergent conundrums\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2023 video games\nFocus Entertainment games\nReal-time tactics video games\nReal-time strategy video games\nVideo games set in the 22nd century\nVideo games set in outer space\nAlien (franchise) games\nVideo games developed in France\nWindows games\nInterquel video games\nPlayStation 4 games\nPlayStation 5 games\nXbox One games\nXbox Series X and Series S games\nPermadeath games\nTindalos Interactive games\nTop-down video games", "unikey": "Aliens: Dark Descent", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Gameplay", "Story", "Development", "Reception", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["TheDark Descentstory is set in the year 2198, 19 years after the events of the original trilogy films.

is more than an xcom clone  and feels surprisingly true to themovies article by alex donaldson assistant editor published on aug 26 2022 5 comments follow aliens dark descent keeping track of the map is important because youre not just on temporary battle box maps that exist only for firefights youre exploring a wider area a base that youll gradually uncover its almost a bit like how a planet might work in a metroid game even though its a completely different sort of game  and youll even be able to uncover shortcuts across the planet to that end perspectivewise the map realtime movement and camera perspective almost makes it look like a spacebound diablo at least for a moment the first moment the map was opened was one of the big eureka moments for me in this presentation it really showcases how this title differs from its inspiration with lots of motion trackers placed you can see dots representing the deadly aliens darting about up and down corridors patrolling rooms and actively searching for your squad theres fullblown alert states  so when the enemy knows where you are reinforcements will try to chase you down until you can lose them your party of marines will have to do things like weld shut airlock doors in order to block off aliens  but thatll also change your own path through the base the cool element about the map is that theres a sense of permanence even when you return to your hub things youve placed like motion trackers remain aliens still patrol and yes the poor marines you lose in permanent death remain there their corpses a testament to your tactical failures theres a lot of tactics to manage too youve got a squad of four that can be any of six different classes each with abilities weapons and skills to consider the two key stats to manage are health and stress  the former familiar and the latter a representation of the sanity of your marines the more stressed they are the worse their performance will be  topping out in outright panic where a marine is rendered practically useless combat is real time but you can slow things to a crawl allowing orders to be issued this also has the bonus of looking extremely cool if you set up an ambush in a doorway watching a hail of bullets slowmo slam into a xenomorph is extremely satisfying handsoff demos are obviously not as useful as getting to play it but at first blush from a half hour of gameplay aliens dark descent looks great its also a different sort of alienbased experience  less the creeping horror of the first movie and more the intense action of the second xenomorphs are tough but youre still taking them down in relatively large numbers  in fact youre arguably most worried about being overrun with xcom 3 probably a while off theres an open market for that sort of game  but im thrilled that dark descent is also clearly something quite different a subtle twist on a structure that worked brilliantly i look forward to actually playing it soon sign in and unlock a

verdict aliens dark descent is a fresh and fun take on the series with great tactical action supplemented with unique concepts like stress management the writing and characters sadly dont amount to anything memorable and boss battles can feel incredibly jarring to the pacing and tension pros excellent tactical actionfresh concepts like stress levelsintriguing setup cons dull writing and charactersboss battles upset the atmosphere why you can trust gamesradar fight to survive down time ive always found theres some undeniably horrific about realtime strategy games peering down on a battlefield and seeing an army getting massacred beyond belief and knowing oops i did that will really make one feel horrendous while smaller in scope aliens dark descent is gunning for this same terrifying feeling of helplessnessfast factsdeveloper tindalos interactive publisher focus entertainment release date june 20 2023 platforms pc ps5 ps4 xbox series x xbox onethe new realtime strategy game from developer tindalos interactive puts you in control of a group of space marines armed to the teeth fighting tooth and nail against xenomorph horrors it wouldve been easy to look at dark descents tactical trappings and wonder what possessed tindalos to take the series in such a direction but the tactical action has a chokehold of suspense on you from the jumpfight to surviveimage credit focus entertainmentyoull command your squad of marines into dark caverns and dingy corridors peering into rooms and just praying there arent a couple xenomorphs there waiting for you every foot forward feels like rolling the dice gambling with the lives of your squad as they press on to encounter the unthinkable and then reacting in a split second when a xenomorph inevitably appears and charges full pelt at your squadaliens dark descents action is pulsepounding as i maneuvered from one claustrophobic environment to the next i could barely take my eyes off of the motion tracker as soon as something out there moves  whether thats towards or away from you  its time to hunker down and prepare for the worst just one xeno ambushing your squad can instantly render a marine dead so youre constantly on the lookout for any threatyou can command marines to use abilities like overwatch on a particular area placing a mine to block a route or setting up a lethal sentry turret these are key to survival but theyre also a limited resource hinging on a recharging meter this means that while firepower can feel overwhelming against the aliens its also neatly stunted  youre always thinking about saving some gas in the tank for the next encounterimage credit focus entertainmentthe hordes are where everything comes to a terrifying head every now and then youll get a notification that a horde is on their way to disembowel your marines and youve got roughly 20 seconds to prepare for arrival palms get sweaty real quickly here as youll have to find a good point to defend and pray youve got enough ammo turrets grenades and special abilities to see out the xenos its a randomized element you can never truly predict and works wonders for making aliens dark descent feel genuinely threateningsadly though boss battles do unravel this tension occasionally a mission will throw an elite enemy at you but itll warn you that pressing a button of interacting with a terminal will trigger said fight knowing the fight is coming sort of takes the wind out of its sails but on the other hand the boss fights are nearimpossible to overcome if you havent already planned for them aliens dark descent is sort of caught between a rock and a hard place here and as a result the boss battles are a little jarring to the pacing of a missiondown timeimage credit focus entertainmentaliens dark descent is so much more than just pressing forward and shooting every marine has a stress meter that can increase for a myriad of reasons did they just shoot a xenomorph in the face get splashed by its acidic blood and see its friends come out to play on the minimap theyre really stressed now and its up to you as the commander to manage that stress level and literally stop them from freaking outto do this you need to create a safe room having your soldiers weld a door shut is all well and good for halting a xenomorph but if you weld shut every entrance to one room youll create a space where your squad can take a breather and recoup their mental strength its a brilliant and original feature that makes you stop and consider your squad of toughs as a little more human than just walking gunsthis also feeds back into the management aspect of aliens dark descent tindalos takes a page out of xcoms book and makes you consider your soldiers after a mission if theyre overly stressed theyll need treatment in the trauma center while a wound will take days to recover in medical taking them out of subsequent missions its an extra layer of complexity which works to make the marines under your command feel like more than an expendable resourceunfortunately though the writing of aliens dark descent is just plain poor were playing as deputy administrator maeko hayes teaming up with space marine toughs like jason harper theres incredibly little depth to these characters especially the marines who talk with their chests puffed out and like every interaction is a battle to be overcome and won dark descent feels like it wants to take after aliens brotastic writing of its marines but theres not enough depth here to make individuals shine throughimage credit focus entertainmenttheres a neat idea at the outset of aliens dark descent though horror always has its idiot characters people who do things that go against all sense and logic in the heat of the moment and the aliens series is no exception to this aliens burke locking himself away from the only people who can save him springs to mind dark descent actually has us playing as this idiot trope as the game begins with hayes mercilessly opting to launch rockets at every ship in the vicinity after a xenomorph outbreak just in case theyre infestedthey are in fact not infested and hayes realizes this pretty quickly one of these ships is the otago which is your base of command for the rest of dark descent immediately putting hayes at ground zero of her error its a really good narrative point twisting that idiot trope to put you in the command chair of the role for a change its a shame nothing else in dark descents story comes close to this level but its a nice setup nonethelessaliens dark descent is a surprisingly inventive new strategic take on the series bringing fresh ideas to the party with stress levels and hordes while borrowing from xcoms action and the movies air of pure dread the writing and characters fall woefully short of this high bar though and boss battle work to sadly undo a lot of the tension dark descent brilliantly establishes in its momenttomoment gameplay

the game was but ill be keeping an eye out for a decent price on it now 3 5psboxswitchownersat 1st jul 2023 35 seems great pricesadly right now i have a stack of games but i will definitely give it a blast at some point 3 6wallywestsat 1st jul 2023 hopefully getting it next week as im a massive alien fan really happy its getting good reviews 1 7johnnyshouldersat 1st jul 2023 massive fan of the

was a demo of this to try i do enjoy a good alien game but im not sure i will enjoy the strategy style as i really couldnt get in to xcom 1 10palleonsat 1st jul 2023 bearseatbeets its just another bug hunt boys 1 11trev666sat 1st jul 2023 also recommend alien isolation one of the best survival horror games ever 2 12ear_wigsat 1st jul 2023 1 13fiendishbeaversat 1st jul 2023 im enjoying the game thus far i only started it yesterday so im not particularly far in im playing on hard not nightmare and boy it lives up to its name it is hard im not sure whether i would have been better to play through on an easier difficulty first to get a better understanding of the game and its mechanicsmy only real gripe is the marines constantly shouting out the same lines im thinking to myself get around the map quietly and the marines are shouting on my way or double time when in fact theyre walking  talk about stealthyother than that minor gripe which i cannot apparently turn off or have them speak less frequently i am enjoying the game 3 14tj81sat 1st jul 2023 1 15mattsilveradosat 1st jul 2023 just watched the entire aliens saga from avp onwards this seems interesting but i dont have time to spend on this tipe of game  0 16discol76sat 1st jul 2023 added to the ever increasing wanted list fantastic price also 2 17lumicsat 1st jul 2023 tj81 youre bang on with your assessment was really deep into diablo iv and this was the game to completely pull me away from it love how tense it is 3 18tj81sat 1st jul 2023 ear_wig my advice is to consider custom difficulty options the game even warns you its going to be tough when youve lost all your marines thats it game over man game over you can extract from missions at any point if you can get back to the vehicle safely and come back better prepared but each time you do this you skip a day and each day the hive gets more aggressive and the game ultimately tougher you cant change difficulty during the game and restarting means running through the tutorial prologue again i loved it though things to consider 3 19ouchsat 1st jul 2023 wasnt even on my radar now its a must have 0 20dudditz09sat 1st jul 2023 ive been having a blast with it fantastic game especially for 35 0 21ear_wigsat 1st jul 2023 tj81 thanks for the info im definitely not afraid of tough games just curious about the overall vibe of the difficulty sounds like it can be pretty punishing which certainly fits the franchise 0 22qu1n0n3zsat 1st jul 2023 im really interested on this one but since there are bigger games on my list  ill wait until they release a couple of patch  price drop to jump in 0 23tj81sat 1st jul 2023 ear_wig yeah its the only realistic aliens game along with isolation in that respect im a wimpi dont have as many gaming hours in my middle age though so im employing custom difficulty settings to make certain aspects less brutal its still challenging regardless 1 24ear_wigsun 2nd jul 2023 tj81 yep cant grind away the hours like we used to when we were kids i appreciate that some modern games have these custom difficulty options last of us 2 did a fantastic job with that 2 25cheriptherippersun 2nd jul 2023 lolwhatno in fairness theres still quite a lot of surprising couch coop games on console so its not that farfetched where have you been btw missed you for like a year  2 26tallythwacksun 2nd jul 2023 this looks great i have a feeling itll reduce in price quite quickly my backlog is huge so gonna wait a few weeks before picking it uphopefully by then itll be patched and bug free 0 27tallythwacksun 2nd jul 2023 mattsilverado i love them all watched them multiple times alien 3 doesnt get the love it deserves its superb 2 28cheriptherippersun 2nd jul 2023 ayooo you just made me realize ive been postponing buying that  for over a year now  ngl they have been adding a lot of stuff over the year and it looks as neat as ever but atm im just waiting for the new forza to scratch that sim itch i almost forgot btw youre big on fromsoft right your pfp reminded me of it  ive recently dug more into their library finished sekiro bloodborne and the demons souls remake been thinking about digging into dark souls 1 or 2 3 ive already done for the most part as well but i dont really wanna go into it alone  may your ventures be bountiful happy eid  tallythwack ive recently taken the time to watch the alien  predator movies liked some disliked some but alien³ stands as the only movie i havent watched of the lot because when i read of it it all goes both ways which version did you watch or would you recommend i prefer aliens over alien 1 29dusk_actualsun 2nd jul 2023 just bought this looks like a really good time 0 30dusk_actualsun 2nd jul 2023 tallythwack this is what i should have done but the 40 was burning a hole in my pocket lol 0 31cieloazuresun 2nd jul 2023 the bugs dont ruin the game it is hard at times but really fun 0 32tallythwackmon 3rd jul 2023 cheriptheripper if your gonna watch one its gotta be the directors cut of alien 3 nothing wrong with liking aliens over alienboth totally different movies and its down to personal preference 1 33cheriptherippermon 3rd jul 2023 lolwhatnoreally want to give sekiro a shot what did you think of it what games of the series did you prefer in general tooah man i hope i dont manage to negatively influence your opinion of me all that much now given that i have to answer that question i quite liked sekiro for context i suck at parrying whenever a game gives you the option to use parry and its not anywhere near to vital so really just optional i never use it i just dodge or block in gamesso sekiro is a game i never wanted to try out because it was as parry heavy as it isi had however prior to trying sekiro completed nioh 2  demons souls and was left wanting more so i checked it out went on to play bloodborne as well afterwards which was as recent as last monthif i had to rank them best to worst elden ring basically my first fromsoft game sekiro ds3 even though i havent completed it bloodborne or demons souls remakedemons souls was just plain annoying it did look nice but in every possible facet of a game it was sadly the progenitor to all of the other soulslikes which just made it plain inferior imo some boss fights were cool though some pretty cool standout moments in general but wouldnt recommend it to anyone lest you be a soulsfanbloodborne was majorly disappointing ive always heard it was more atmospherical than the other games more aggressive as well and i was looking forward to the lovecraft influences but it sadly wasnt all that much ive read a few hpl novels prior to playing so i had certain expectations they just werent metalso of note i did originally try playing bb some 45 years back but never got past gascoigne this time around i didnt die more than 5 times a boss got to go through most bosses first time and didnt have much of a problem navigating the areas either it was all just a bit lacklustre and i had a constant feeling the game was a bit small in sizei did however not play the dlc which i have read and seen enough about to know it probably is worthwhileso yeah you can probably notice im not a regular fromsoft fan lolsekiro was great though ive always read playing it was like dancing which when you try it and get to genichiro will probably become very evidentit had some  design here and there but overall a great game boss fights were very neat and gangsta 0 34systemaddictmon 3rd jul 2023 this looks nifty ill get it down the line 0 tap here to load 34 comments leave a comment

dark descent aliens dark descent review aliens dark descent is an authentically atmospheric campaign borrowing from both turnbased tactics and survival horror stymied by a seemingly deep paranoia you might mistake it for one of those strategy games for nerds its not its not for nerds its for cool aliens fans you can use a controller its not for nerds developer tindalos interactive publisher focus entertainment release tuesday 20th june on windows from steam epic price 35  40  40 reviewed on intel core i58600k 16gb ram nvidia rtx 2070 windows 10 image credit focus entertainment image credit focus entertainment image credit focus entertainment but dark descents greatest strengths lie not so much in its nuts and bolts of design but more in what a wellproduced bit of aliens media it is if youve played tindalos interactives battlefleet gothic games youll know that atmosphere and satisfying chunky feeling action are huge strengths of theirs my most memorable moments with the game were never pulling off some supremely tactical play but instead creeping through the lightless corridors of abandoned weyland yutani sites flashlights bouncing off bulkheads the only sounds being the careful footsteps of my squad and that iconic terrifying motion tracker beep the game makes the very smart decision to limit not only healing items but also ammo clips thats aliens to me genuine survival horror punctuated by bursts of intense terrifying violence dark descent pulls it off masterfully i absolutely cant blame tindalos for wanting a game with such a recognisable and beloved license to court appeal outside of genre fans but i also think that if youre going to make a strategy game you should probably make it fullheartedly 2012s xcom felt like a genuine revolution in turnbased tactics but aliens dark descent too often feels like a compromise or more accurately a consolemise if youre thinking wow what a snob then congratulations you get to enjoy something more fully than i did which is much better than griping about things dark descent is beautiful engaging and absolutely drips with authentically atmospheric aliens goo but again like those face huggers its also just a bit too restrictive and i dont think it needed to be rock paper shotgun is the home of pc gaming sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling pc games sign in with
