{"id": 71824027, "key": "Partings", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partings", "text": "\"Partings\" is the fifth episode of the first season of the American fantasy television series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, based on the novel The Lord of the Rings and its appendices by J. R. R. Tolkien. Set in the Second Age of Middle-earth, thousands of years before Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, it follows a large cast of characters as they prepare for upcoming conflicts. The episode was written by Justin Doble and directed by Wayne Che Yip.\n\nAmazon made a multi-season commitment for a new The Lord of the Rings series in November 2017. J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay were set to develop it in July 2018. Filming for the first season took place in New Zealand, and work on episodes beyond the first two began in January 2021. Yip was revealed to be directing four episodes of the season that March, including the fifth episode. Production wrapped for the season in August 2021.\n\n\"Partings\" premiered on the streaming service Amazon Prime Video on September 23, 2022. It was estimated to have high viewership and received generally positive reviews.\n\nPlot \nThe Harfoots continue their migration to the Grove for the winter. While looking for food in a forest, Nori Brandyfoot, Poppy Proudfellow, and Malva Meadowgrass are attacked by a pack of wolves. The Stranger accompanying them intervenes and uses magic to scare off the wolves, but his use of magic injures his own arm. He uses more magic to heal himself and nearly hurts Nori, frightening her. Meanwhile, a trio of mysterious women find the location where the Stranger fell from the sky.\n\nAt the tower of Ostirith in the Southlands, Bronwyn attempts to prepare the other human refugees to defend themselves from the army of Orcs that are coming to claim their lands. Tavern owner Waldreg thinks they will be better off joining the Orcs and convinces around half of the refugees to leave with him. Waldreg is disappointed to learn that the leader of the Orcs, Adar, is not Sauron, but still chooses to serve him. To confirm his loyalty, Adar orders Waldreg to kill one of the other humans, Rowan. At the tower, Theo shows Arondir the broken sword the Orcs are hunting for and Arondir realizes that it is some sort of key designed to enslave the Southlanders.\n\nElendil denies his son Isildur's request to join Númenor's expedition to the Southlands, saying Isildur lost his chance to serve previously. Discussing the expedition with Queen Regent Míriel, Galadriel says the human Halbrand will be accompanying them to claim the throne of Southlands. He accuses Galadriel of using him and says he wants to remain in Númenor instead. Meanwhile, Chancellor Pharazôn's son Kemen attempts to convince his father to cancel the expedition to Middle-earth, but Pharazôn sees potential in turning the Southlands into a tributary state after its liberation. Míriel's father, King Tar-Palantir, warns her not to go to Middle-earth.\n\nHigh-King Gil-galad reveals to Elrond that he knows of the existence of mithril, an ore that contains the light from a lost Silmaril that he believes can counteract the fading power of the Elves in Middle-earth. Elrond refuses to confirm that the Dwarves have discovered the ore, out of loyalty to Prince Durin IV, and Gil-galad accuses him of putting the Dwarves before his own race. Elrond later discusses the issue with Durin IV and the latter agrees to help. The pair return to Khazad-dûm to try convince King Durin III.\n\nKemen attempts to destroy the expedition ships and discovers Isildur stowing away. Isildur prevents the destruction of three of the five ships and saves Kemen's life. When questioned by Elendil, Isildur lies about Kemen's sabotage. He subsequently receives a spot on the expedition crew, as a stable sweep. Galadriel apologizes for using Halbrand and opens up to him. He eventually decides to go with the expeditionary force, and the remaining ships depart for Middle-earth.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \nAmazon acquired the global television rights for J. R. R.

tolkien fans got another good look at this new middleearth story when the first teaser debuted during the super bowl this sunday now showrunners patrick mckay and jd payne offer up even more details and insights and answer some of the more urgent questions tolkien fans have been asking about the series set in middleearths second age long before bilbo and frodo baggins went adventuringa battle scene in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studioswill it look like the lord of the ringsin creating this new story mckay and paynes goal was in mckays words different but familiar while the series is not a precise continuation of peter jacksons the lord of the rings it shouldnt clash with the cinematic world fans have come to know and love actors like morfydd clark galadriel and robert aramayo elrond were cast in part because they could age into the older versions played respectively by cate blanchett and hugo weaving in jacksons films even benjamin walker who plays gilgalad bears a striking resemblance to mark ferguson who appeared as the elven king in a nonspeaking cameo in the fellowship of the rings prologueits worth remembering if only for legal reasons that this is not the exact same world the production design though similar is not trying to match the jackson films for example king elendils legendary broken sword narsil which debuted on one of prime videos promotional posters does not look identical to the one eventually reforged and used by viggo mortensons aragorn in the return of the kingthe amazon show has an advantage in that its prime locationslike númenor the elven cities of lindon and eregion and the intact dwarven city of khazaddûmdidnt play into jacksons films in the rings of power one of the most identifiable middleearth landmarks the great tower of baraddûr where saurons flaming eyeball sits hasnt been built yet nor has the black gate of mordor or the doors of durin the rings of power costume designer kate hawley who worked on jacksons hobbit films as well as guillermo del toros lavish crimson peak is creating middleearth fashions that existed thousands of years before liv tylers arwen draped herself in endless velvethawley isnt the only overlap between the jackson era and this one john howe a beloved conceptual designer who worked on the films lent his talents to the rings of power we were very lucky to have some alums that had experience in middleearth come back in payne says we were the beneficiaries of their experience of having worked in middleearth before we reached out to peter  but between covid and his schedules and our schedules didnt manage to actually ever get together for coffee but certainly would love to at some pointmckay adds our only relationship is as big fans and admirersthe pair were quick to point out that the jackson films were not their only inspiration the universe that this show wants to be in is tolkiensand thats an umbrella over peters filmsand led zeppelin john howes paintings and the hobbit cartoon mckay saysmorfydd clark as galadriel in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studioshow much cgi should audiences expectas fans will have already seen in the super bowl teaser there are plenty of innovative digital effects in the rings of power but theres been a recent movement led by lucasfilm and star wars in both genre filmmaking and its fandom away from an overreliance on digital effects that perceived overreliance was something some fans disliked in jacksons hobbit trilogy mckay and payne had a keen interest in practical effects and realworld locations which didnt always align with their admittedly enormous budgetan example would be khazaddûm payne says the duo wanted to shoot the dwarven mining city under an actual mountain in new zealand theres this place called the lost worldthat has this whole ecosystem and is absolutely crazy payne says the practicalities of trying to spelunk their cast and 300 crew members soon put that idea to rest instead they built a lavish version on a soundstagebut in dreaming up wild fantastical monsters and ambitious realworld locations mckay and payne learned that the trickiest challenges of making a middleearth show lay elsewhere payne recalls their visual effects coordinator saying do you want to know what the single most complicated scene that youve written in season one is its a scene in which the elf and the dwarf walk down a hallway togethermckays says you have to shoot everything twice it ends up being like an sat problem where a hobbit and a dwarf and a man and an elf each leave a train station traveling at x miles per hour who is going to get to mount doom first so it will be down to the millimeter mimicking the exact same moves and then the two things get spliced together and create this effect of one person being taller and smaller we have a group of actual wizards that work on the show and they came up with a huge bag of tricks in which we are constantly able to keep the audience guessing payne promises they will be using every single trick in the bookold school new school everythingin a way that we are told no one has attempted some of the stranger monsters may be digital confections but when orclike baddies attack the rings of power heroes its guys in suits not piles of pixelselijah wood as frodo in the return of the king courtesy of amazon studioswhat exactly is the source material hereso what did amazon buy we have the rights solely to the fellowship of the ring the two towers the return of the king the appendices and the hobbit payne says and that is it we do not have the rights to the silmarillion unfinished tales the history of middleearth or any of those other books that takes a huge chunk of lore off the table and has left tolkien fans wondering how this duo plans to tell a second age story without access to those materials theres a version of everything we need for the second age in the books we have the rights to mckay says as long as were painting within those lines and not egregiously contradicting something we dont have the rights to theres a lot of leeway and room to dramatize and tell some of the best stories that ever came up withwe took all these little clues and thought of them as stars in the sky that we then connected to write the novel that tolkien never wrote about the second age payne says the duo cites songs like the fall of gilgalad you can hear actor bill nighy sing it here from a 1981 bbc radio adaptation or the song of eärendil or fellowship chapters like the council of elrond and the shadow of the past or the concerning hobbits section of the prologue as sources for significant lore dumps beyond the premiere there arent however any significant time jumps or thus far episodelong journeys to the past the rights to the first age material from the silmarillion are still owned by the tolkien estatewe worked in conjunction with worldrenowned tolkien scholars and the tolkien estate to make sure that the ways we connected the dots were tolkienian and gelled with the experts and the estates understanding of the material payne sayssophia nomvete as princess disa in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studioswill it sound like the lord of the ringsjackson and his team had the advantage of working off tolkiens novels and could lift long passages of dialogue straight from the source but mckay and payne are building their story from sparser material heres where their love for tolkiens language came into play we start every single day of our writers room with a quote from the books payne says every day in production a quote from the books gets emailed outthat season one writers room was packed with talented minds who know a thing or two about creating in the genre space game of thrones bryan cogman worked briefly to get the project started while jason cahill fringe halt and catch fire stephany folsom thor ragnarok justin doble stranger things gennifer hutchison breaking bad helen shang hannibal and glenise mullins star trek discovery fleshed out the rest of the teamin studying the language from the first three episodes amazon let vanity fair screen we found a mix of cleverly repurposed lines of tolkiens dialogue as well as a few snatches of biblical text both patrick and i have religious backgrounds payne says i spent a lot of time just reading those sacred texts i was an english major at yale and loved shakespeare at the time and still go back and reread the various plays ive also spent a lot of time studying hebrew poetry and parallelism and inverted parallelism and chiasmus and all these cool rhetorical strategies that poets and prophets from thousands of years ago would use to communicate sacred material and tolkien sometimes will play in that kind of a sandboxmarkella kavenagh as nori brandyfoot in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosmckay explains that they tailored the dialogue to fit each kind of character the harfoots speak with an irish lilt whereas the elves speak in elevated british phrases we even came up with hero meters for each different race in tolkien payne says some of them will speak in iambs some of them will speak in dactyls some of them will speak in trochees that indepth approach might please professor tolkien whose specialty was philology aka the history of languageokay but will it feel like the lord of the ringsi suppose thats up to you to decide but mckay and payne have spent a long time thinking about tolkiens themes mckay points out that peter jackson nailed exactly the tone theyre chasing what i loved about those first three films in particular in his characters and his worlds its heartfelt but its complex and political its dark and intense but its also whimsical and funny and sweet its very rare to find an author who in any medium tries to play every note on the piano sometimes its suspenseful sometimes its scary sometimes its esoteric and complex and wildly imaginative but its all middleearthowain arthur as prince durin iv in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosdid vanity fair make an error in calling the dwarven prince durin ivnope the redbearded owain arthur photographed in vanity fairs deep dive into the rings of power is prince durin iv but tolkien scholars will cry out it was durin iii who was given one of the rings of power by sauron yes king durin iii is also in the show and hes portrayed by someone who knows something about playing a bad dad in tolkiens works durin iii and durin iv are not father and son and the title of durin is more complicated than just a name but remember that mckay and payne are compacting thousands of years of tolkiens second age down into one shortened timelineismael cruz córdovas elf arondir and nazanin boniadis human bronwyn in the rings of power by ben rothsteinamazon studioswhats the deal with this elfandhuman romancetolkien fans may still be scratching their heads over the interspecies love triangle in the hobbit trilogy between legolas tauriel the elf and killi the dwarf it was an invention of peter jacksons and an effort to add romance to the almost entirely romanceless story of the hobbit but forbidden romances across cultures though rare in the middleearth record are of particular fascination to tolkien two of his most famous loversberen and lúthien as well as aragorn and arwenare humanelf pairings that crossed boundaries and defied conventions to be with each other on tolkiens gravestone the name lúthien is inscribed under his wifes and beren under his own you could argue that the rarity of these love stories along with the lesserknown one between andreth and aegnor is what makes them special but these pairings speak to tolkiens core preoccupation with mortality who gets to live forever who doesnt and what would you give up to be with someone you love so though the spark between ismael cruz córdovas elf arondir and nazanin boniadis human bronwyn does not dominate season ones plot its a way for mckay and payne to engage with a story that tolkien himself found compellingthis sounds like a lot of madeup story what of tolkiens can one expectthe truth is its all here we told amazon we wanted to do four or five stories that are the big epics of the second age mckay says starting with the forging of the rings at the center of that origin is the famed elven smith celebrimbor charles edwards and aramayoss younger elrond in eregion elrond is working to rebuild damaged alliances with the dwarves including with his old friend prince durin iv were going back thousands of years to when the party was in full swing mckay says were going to see the elf capital of lindon where elrond is a young upandcoming operator within the political scene of the high elves during their glory day lindon with its golden autumn leaves and rocky shores allowed payne and mckay to expand on the beautiful new zealand vistas jackson captured for his film we wanted to go to coastlines mckay says youve never seen the coastline of middleearth onscreen beforethe elf capital of lindon in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosas for reconciling the idea of a young elrond eager to make alliances with the closedoff version hugo weaving played in the jackson films payne says thats just part of the journey elrond we know from the third age has a pretty bleak view on humans he says men are weak because hes seen the foibles of humankind in some ways the third age is almost postapocalyptic middleearth the elves have one foot out the door were going to watch as elrond goes from optimistic to a bit more worldwearythe second big story on mckay and paynes agenda is the rise of sauron himself when he was a physical villain says mckay no word yet on who might be playing the dark lord in his younger more seductive phase yes sauron the flaming eyeball was once canonically hot or in the words of tolkien himself fair to the eyes of men he may be hiding in plain sight or he may be yet to come but galadriels search for him takes her and eventually the strange human shes encountered halbrand charlie vickers all over the mapcharlie vickers as halbrand in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosif they do it right its the easter egg phenomenon that people really like with this kind of stuff tolkien scholar michael drout says its going to be to see place x or place y more than person x or yspeaking of maps when amazons official lord of the rings social accounts made their first announcement they created waves across the tolkien fandom by posting an image of middleearth with a starshaped island called númenor this payne says is the third story on their list the rise and fall of the island kingdom of númenor emphasis on the fall tolkiens version of atlantis is ruled by aragorns ancestors mortals with an extended life span that are far more advanced and powerful than those who dwell on the mainland of middleearthtolkien scholars will know that complicated clashes over succession to the númenorian throne between characters tarmíriel and arpharazôn the islands last king will allow payne and mckay to explore the kind of dangerous palace intrigue that made the best of game of thrones so compelling one of the characters well follow from this oceanic realm will be isildur played by maxim baldry a young sailor who one day becomes the warrior who slices the one ring from saurons hand only to succumb to the artifacts power himself this isnt a spoiler its literally the setup for the lord of the rings you meet isildur and hes like michael corleone mckay says hes the young member of the family who has optimism and immaturity trace that guy to the tragic final decision rather than the mistake of a fool his temptation and his relationship with his father elendil is all part of the final story on the list the last alliance of elves and menisildurs legacy looms over the fellowship of the ring in the form of the argonath statues courtesy of amazon studiosall of those stories will unfold over the course of several seasons but the first season mckay says is all about the heroes we didnt want to do a villaincentric thing we wanted it to be about introducing these worlds and the peoples who dwell in them and the major heroes and characters some of whom you know and some of whom are new season two we go a little bit deeper into the lore and the stories people have been waiting to hearmorfydd clark as galadriel in the rings of power by matt graceamazon studioswhats up with warrior galadriel is this in the booksover the years tolkien adapters have had to get creative in order to include his female characters in the action liv tylers arwen making a riverbank stand against the nazgul in defense of frodo and the very existence of evangeline lillys warrior elf tauriel all invented by peter jackson but eowyns but no living man am i showdown with the witchking of angmar in the return of the king is straight out of the books and shows that tolkien was at least somewhat interested in women who pick up swords as does his description of galadriel during the many thousand years of her long youth tolkien claimed young galadriel could match strength with most male counterparts and in a 1973 letter wrote she was then of amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats this is how she got her name galadriel which means maiden crowned with gleaming hair in the unfinished tales it says  looked upon the dwarves also with the eye of a commander seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the orcsshes full of piss and vinegar and shes got a sword thats broken because shes killed so many orcs mckay says of their version this young hotheaded galadrielhow did she ever become that elder stateswoman whats more important than galadriels armor and weaponry is the turmoil of emotions we see raging inside her having already survived multiple attacks by sauron and his predecessor morgoth and losing her brothers in the process this internal conflict still lingers in the striking fellowship of the ring sequence where tempted by the one ring a booming cate blanchett goes photonegative tolkien writes her this speech in place of the dark lord you will set up a queen and i shall not be dark but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night fair as the sea and the sun and the snow upon the mountain dreadful as the storm and the lightning stronger than the foundations of the earth all shall love me and despaircate blanchett as galadriel in the fellowship of the ring courtesy of amazon studiosthe rings of power makes a direct nod toward this moment when as galadriel first meets the human character halbrand he says a line that echoes what tolkien had her say to frodo the tides of fate are flowing in or out halbrand wonders in the history of middleearth tolkien describes the one ring as all that galadriel had desired in her youth she has a lifelong flirtation with the darkness inside of her and even in her later years she remains one of the few people sauron fears its what makes her much more complex than a simple and serene lady of the woods if you want to know if morfydd clark is capable of matching blanchetts terrifying turn check out her blissfully unhinged performance in the horror film saint mauddaniel weyman as a mystery man and markella kavenagh as nori brandyfoot in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosokay but will there be wizardsin the footage that premiered in the rings of power super bowl teaser audiences caught a glimpse of a tall mysterious man who falls from the sky our immediate instinct is to wonder if hes one of the wizards even the most casual fans might have heard of in tolkiens text they didnt come to middleearth until the third age but is the show taking some added liberties with the timeline when asked if this might be gandalf radagast or saruman mckay answered cautiously well i would say those are not the only beings those names in that class so maybe but maybe not and the mystery and the journey of it is all of the fun i would saypayne adds there are tiny little nods to tolkien that could send you this way or send you that way and we are hoping people will like taking that and putting together a huge puzzlewhat is known for certain is that this mystery mans story connects to the harfoot character nori brandyfoot markella kavenagh seen in the super bowl teaser powers can be used for good or bad and harfoots have rules that youre not supposed to engage with the big folk mckay says most rules in middleearth however are made to be brokenrobert armayo as elrond in the rings of power courtesy of amazon studiosso should fans be worriedfans will always be worried thats the nature of adapting something as beloved and enduring as the lord of the rings mckay and payne can relate but its important to remember that tolkien himself envisioned a

struggling for survival on a raft in the stormswept sundering seas alongside a mortal castaway named halbrand charlie vickers who is a new character introduced in the show galadriel is fighting for the future halbrand is running from the past their entwined destinies are just two of the stories woven together for a tv series that if it works could become a global phenomenon if it falls short it could become a cautionary tale for anyone who to quote jrr tolkien delves too greedily and too deepamazons show which debuts on prime video on september 2 is based not on a tolkien novel per se but on the vast backstory he laid out in the appendices to the lord of the rings trilogy five seasons will likely cost the studio well over 1 billionthat kind of budget might decimate most other studios but tolkien like space travel is a personal obsession for amazon founder jeff bezos whos among the richest people in the world this is a bigticket business venture that will allow him to create the most expensive elaborate tv series ever made while jackson is not connected to the project his movies as well as their spiritual successor game of thrones proved that theres a massive audience for immersive fantasy of course many have tried to capture that same audience and few have survived or thrivedgaladriel commander of the northern armiesmatt graceamazon studiosbecause of bezoss immense wealth the rings of power is actually less of a financial risk than it is a reputational one amazon needs to definitively make the case that it can produce giant prestige shows and with this series its courting the additional danger of amending and elaborating on the canon of a beloved storyteller the showrunners patrick mckay and jd payne are agonizingly aware of the pressure their series will juggle 22 stars and multiple story lines from deep within the dwarf mines of the misty mountains to the high politics of the elven kingdom of lindon and the humans powerful atlantislike island númenor all this will center eventually around the incident that gives the trilogy its name the forging of the rings says mckay rings for the elves rings for dwarves rings for men and then the one ring sauron used to deceive them all its the story of the creation of all those powers where they came from and what they did to each of those races the driving question behind the production he adds was this can we come up with the novel tolkien never wrote and do it as the megaevent series that could only happen nownot a subscriber join us todayarrowgaladriels survival at sea is not just a crucial story point at the start of the seriesthe showrunners remember it as a pivotal moment on set in new zealand back in march 2020 morfydd was a few days into being galadriel which is probably terrifying says mckay shes in water theres a lot of visual effects theres music and light but despite the momentous scene in front of them the shows crew were glued to their phones within 45 minutes word spread that in nearby australia tom hanks had contracted covid the nba had canceled its season and the world health organization declared a global pandemic were all just going oh my god what are we going to do were going to have to shut everything down  says mckay the panic metastasized setting off other anxieties big and small it was terrifying oh my god is anyone going to understand what were trying to do here is this way too ambitious we have no idea whats going to happen tomorrow can you imagine going back to such a beloved world and facing the high bar of the peter jackson movies we were all the time very aware of the massive expectationsbut one by one the crew put down their phones everyone was crowding around the monitor as were doing this closeup where galadriels face fills the screen and she cries and she decides i have to fight says mckay as soon as the scene ended the soundstage erupted in cheers its a perfect example of how tolkien and middleearth have a way of finding you even in the darkest and most uncertain moments says paynewhatever other chaos might befall them they finally felt they were on the right path the first three episodes which vf has seen suggest they were the show is a lavish compelling mix of palace intrigue magic warfare and mythologyand there are enough mysteries to power a thousand podcasts some characters will be familiar and they will be the initial attraction as viewers watch their legendary fates unfurl but the entirely new faces may ultimately become even more involving since their destinies are literally unwrittenowain arthur as prince durin

silvan elf arondir played by ismael cruz cordova is a character whos been created for the seriesmatt graceamazon studiospreviously this part of the story was most famous as ruins after the success of his 1937 childrens story the hobbit tolkien turned his attention back to a volume of middleearth history which his publishers rejected a more complete version was published posthumously as the silmarillion so as the second world war of his lifetime raged around him tolkien crafted an adventure about beings from very different societies putting aside their differences to stamp out an overpowering evil this of course was the lord of the ringsin that story an unlikely fellowship ventures into mordor to destroy saurons ring along the way tolkien wanted the characters to pass through a scarred landscape full of the remains of the many civilizations and battles that had come before their journey after all was not about confronting a new danger but finally eradicating an ancient onea scourge of malevolence that had tormented the land for eons tolkien dreamed up whole kingdoms then collapsed them for backgroundgaladriel and halbrand charlie vickers meet in dire circumstancesben rothsteinamazon studiosthe effect worked almost too well after the publication of the fellowship of the ring and the two towersin july and november of 1954 respectivelyreaders became obsessive most people want more and better maps tolkien wrote to a friend in 1956 musicians want tunes and musical notations archeologists enquire about ceramics metallurgy tools and architecture historians require more details about the social and political structure to give them everything tolkien informed his publisher would require a book at least the size of vol 1instead borrowing from his rejected silmarillion he squeezed thousands of years of history into about 150 pages of postscript which became known as the appendices these timelines genealogies and notes on language and culture became so important to tolkien that he even stalled the publication of the final book the return of the king to complete them they play a major part in producing the total effect tolkien explained to a foreign publisher in 1961 producing the compelling sense of historical realityafter tolkiens death his son christopher took the reins of the estate and was famously protective if not intransigent about adaptations of his fathers work fearing commercialization at every turn christopher really disliked lord of the onion rings and the glorification of violence for its own sake says tolkien scholar and wheaton college professor michael drout he was born in 1924 and so the big specialeffects movie franchise thing was just not something he cared about if his father hadnt sold all the lord of the rings and hobbit rights to pay the inheritance taxes i dont think christopher would have sold themthe halfelf elrond robert aramayo is a politically ambitious young leaderben rothsteinamazon studiosover the years christopher tolkien left lucrative bids for other middleearth material on the table but in 2017 as he was preparing to retire the tolkiens held a surprising auction they were selling the rights to the appendices that outlined what the author had referred to as the second age of middleearth along with any references to that time period in the lord of the rings itself if youre not uptodate on your ages the second one is seemingly a time of peace for middleearth after an era of horror and conflict the wicked god morgoth has been defeated and his apprentice sauron has vanished as the series begins galadriel is hunting down the last remnants of their collaborators who claimed the life of her brother the third ageand the adventures of frodo sam and the fellowshipawaits some thousands of years in the futurethe starting price for the tolkien estates auction was a gobsmacking 200 million which would have been a nonstarter if not for the industrys obsession with finding the next game of thrones and money wasnt the only daunting factor a handful of ageless characters like the elves galadriel and elrond could appear in the new series as their younger selves but the studio making it would have to forgo fanfavorite hobbits and wizards who werent major players in the second age the tolkien estate also wanted input into the direction of the seriesthis kind of budget could decimate other studios but tolkien like space travel is a personal obsession for jeff bezosthe potential upside though was a mustsee show with a builtin audience that could virtually guarantee survival in the great global streaming war hbo and netflix were among the bidders but bezoss amazon team won the rights for 250 million he is personally a huge fan of tolkien and incredibly passionate about all of it and very wellversed says jennifer salke the head of amazon studios his desire to be ambitiousand for us to be ambitious with our contenthas always been clear from the moment i got here this fit perfectly with that big ambition to take on something that would require the whole company working together to executeamazon wont confirm the shows budget but on top of the money for the rights the government of new zealand has placed production expenditures at 462 million for the first season alone that figure includes building infrastructure that will be used in later seasonsand its been offset by a 108 million tax rebate but by contrast amazons recent fantasy series the wheel of time reportedly cost 80 million a season once you factor in the eventual global marketing campaignand the cost of those subsequent seasonstheres no question that the rings of power will eventually speed far beyond the billiondollar markbronwyn played by

chose two unlikely newcomers mckay and payne are high school friends from northern virginia who have been writing in hollywood together for 13 years the rings of power is their first credited imdb listing they knowits astounding to them too weve worked on so many projects with so many awesome and exciting people that never got made or worked on things that did get made and we didnt get credit says mckay we were a little bit of a dark horse and amazon talked to absolutely everybodywhoever had any idea for lord of the rings adds payne we were passionate about the material and had a take that matched amazons appetites and ambition they also apparently had a significant champion in jj abrams who knew them from their writing on a star trek movie and reportedly sang their praisespitching 50 hours of television to amazon executivesand ultimately to the tolkien family as wellwas arduous but nothing compared to writing producing and bringing the show to life we felt like hobbits payne says we felt like two very small people in a very big world who had just been entrusted with something that meant so much to so many different people the showrunners found themselves quoting frodos famous line from the end of the fellowship of the ring patrick and i will often look at each other in challenging moments of the show and say im glad youre with me sam hes sam mckay adds just kidding im

accept advice from the very beginning i trusted these guys bayona says i knew what they were going through and they knew what i was going through also because can you imagine going back to such a

here in her apothecary in middleearths southlandsben rothsteinamazon studiosuntil now amazon has said virtually nothing about its show the secrecy has irked some in the fandom accustomed as they were to the close relationship and steady flow of behindthescenes information from jackson and new line studios can a 66yearold text really be spoiled given that many are unfamiliar with the appendices the answer is actually yes we believe all of that work and all of that security and all of that protection will actually be to the benefit of our customers says vernon sanders head of usglobal television for amazon for her part salke thinks the secrecy and the intense fan curiosity it generates is healthy for the show anybody whos scrutinizing or chasing fliers or trying to peek in any crack they can to get details or even speculatingthats all about fan engagement and passion so we view it as such she says the speculation is welcome radio silence has been the norm with marvel dc star wars and latterseason game of thrones but amazons clandestine tactics reached new levels even the cast members were hired without being told which parts they would playthere was one leak in 2019 that however innocuous worried some of those watching from afar the shows resident tolkien scholara widely respected academic named tom shippeygave an apparently unsanctioned interview to a german fan site that july opining on what the show could and could not explore not long after that shippey was no longer involved with the series both he and the showrunners decline to say what exactly happened but the obvious assumption was made by fans it seems like the nda is basically if you tell anyone we can put you through a wood chipper  says drout the tolkien professor amazon no longer shares the names of its scholarsthe rings of power has lost a few other players along the way including actors will poulter and tom budge coupled with the departures of shippey production designer rick heinrichs and one of the executives who helped negotiate the tolkien deal in the first place amazon head of genre sharon tal yguado those losses sparked concern that the production was chaotic early on but fans of the movies will remember that stuart townsend was replaced by viggo mortensen even after he began swinging a sword in new zealand on any long trip the executives and showrunners insist it is inevitable that some dont complete the journeydirector ja bayona points the way for two nomadic hunters wandering the fields of middleearthben rothsteinamazon studiosas lifelong genre fans payne and mckay understand the anxiety some feel about the show we know what its like to be anticipating something and to be terrified that it wont be what you hope says mckay weve been those guys many times over the duo can officially settle some concernsafter news broke that amazon had hired an intimacy coordinator for its new zealand set some fans feared that the production might have lost sight of what makes tolkien tolkien my worry would be if it becomes a game of thrones in the second age says dimitra fimi a tolkien scholar and lecturer at the university of glasgow that wouldnt be what one would associate with tolkiens vision it would also be derivativeshowrunners patrick mckay left and jd payne right on the new zealand set of the rings of powerben rothsteinamazon studiosso will there be westerosi levels of violence and sex in amazons middleearth in short no mckay says the goal was to make a show for everyone for kids who are 11 12 and 13 even though sometimes they might have to pull the blanket up over their eyes if its a little too scary we talked about the tone in tolkiens books this is material that is sometimes scaryand sometimes very intense sometimes quite political sometimes quite sophisticatedbut its also heartwarming and lifeaffirming and optimistic its about friendship and its about brotherhood and underdogs overcoming great darknessanother concern is the series going to put hobbits in the second age in short so to speak yes and no one of the very specific things the texts say is that hobbits never did anything historic or noteworthy before the third age says mckay but really does it feel like middleearth if you dont have hobbits or something like hobbits in it the hobbit ancestors in this era are called harfoots they may not live in the shire but they are satisfyingly hobbitadjacent mckay and payne have constructed a pastoral harfoot society that thrives on secrecy and evading detection so that they can play out a kind of rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead story in the margins of the bigger quests two lovable curious harfoots played by megan richards and markella kavenagh encounter a mysterious lost man whose origin promises to be one of the shows most enticing enigmasthe driving question behind the production can we come up with the novel tolkien never wrote and do it as the megaevent series that could only happen nowamazons series will also broaden the notion of who shares the world of middleearth one original story line centers on a silvan elf named arondir played by ismael cruz córdova who will be the first person of color to play an elf onscreen in a tolkien project he is involved in a forbidden relationship with bronwyn a human village healer played by nazanin boniadi a british actor of iranian heritage elsewhere a brit of jamaican descent sir lenny henry plays a harfoot elder and sophia nomvete has a scenestealing role as a dwarven princess named disathe latter being the first black woman to play a dwarf in a lord of the rings movie as well as the first female dwarf it felt only natural to us that an adaptation of tolkiens work would reflect what the world actually looks like says lindsey weber executive producer of the series tolkien is for everyone his stories are about his fictional races doing their best work when they leave the isolation of their own cultures and come togetherwhen amazon released photos of its multicultural cast even without character names or plot details the studio endured a reflexive attack from trollsthe anonymous online kind obviously there was going to be push and backlash says tolkien scholar mariana rios maldonado who is not affiliated with the rings of power but the question is from whom who are these people that feel so threatened or disgusted by the idea that an elf is black or latino or asianeven hardcore fans who regard tolkiens work as sacrosanct will recognize his message of unity staying true to that is as important as realizing his vision of places and characters from this little known era in his fiction we will finally see the full glory of khazaddûmthe cavernous necropolis carved into the misty mountains where in jacksons the fellowship of the ring gandalf famously bellowed at the balrog you shall not pass the show will explore that kingdom when it was still full of light food and music it will also bring the elven smith celebrimbor charles edwards to life as his skill with metals and magic lead to the forging of the rings and a canny young elven architect and politician named elrond robert aramayo will rise to prominence in the mystical capital of lindon another story line will follow a sailor named isildur maxim baldry years before he becomes a warrior and cuts the soulcorrupting ring off saurons hand then

throughout the second age culminating in his resurrection as a tyrant as the show begins there are only hints of the danger to come some see them clearly others dont necessarily want to bayona drew from his memories growing up in spain a country still recovering from a civil war decades before he was born we had a dictatorship for 40 years so you notice the repercussions of war and the shadow of the past he says noting that shadow of the past is in fact the title of the first episode i think this is all about the repercussions of war there is an idea that feels very faithful to tolkien which is intuition galadriel has an intuition that things are not fixed and there is still something lurkingin the novels the aforementioned things take place over thousands of years but payne and mckay have compressed events into a single point in time it is their biggest deviation from the text and they know its a big swing we talked with the tolkien estate says payne if you are true to the exact letter of the law you are going to be telling a story in which your human characters are dying off every season because youre jumping 200 years in time and then youre not meeting really big important canon characters until season four look there might be some fans who want us to do a documentary of middleearth but were going to tell one story that unites all these thingsthe showrunners clearly have great respect for tolkien but you cant make a 50hour adaptation without taking creative risks we think the work will eventually speak for itself payne says when asked if fan concern and speculation ever unnerves him before an orchestra starts audiences will talk to each other but then as soon as the music begins youre in and youre listening to that musicthis story has been

or sauron who went into hiding after the fall of his masterothers think she is on an obsessive fools errand the evil is gone they believe but galadriel senses there is still danger and of course shes
