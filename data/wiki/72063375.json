It took place on December 10, 2022 at the College Park Center in Arlington, Texas. It was ROH's second live event under the full ownership of All Elite Wrestling (AEW) president Tony Khan.\n\nTwelve matches were contested at the event, including four on the pre-show. Claudio Castagnoli defeated Chris Jericho by submission to win the ROH World Championship in the main event. In other prominent matches, The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) defeated FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) by referee stoppage in a Double Dog Collar match to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship in what was Jay's final match in ROH, Wheeler Yuta defeated Daniel Garcia in a Pure Wrestling Rules match to win the ROH Pure Championship, and Athena defeated Mercedes Martinez to win the ROH Women's World Championship. \n\nThe event received positive reviews with the Double Dog Collar Match earning critical acclaim. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter gave the Double Dog Collar Match a 5.5-star rating. The match also finished first in the Voices of Wrestling Match of the Year poll for 2022.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nFinal Battle is a professional wrestling event produced by Ring of Honor. First held in 2002, it is traditionally ROH's last show in the calendar year. It is widely regarded as Ring of Honor's premiere flagship event, similar to WWE's WrestleMania.\n\nOn October 18, 2022, ROH announced that Final Battle would be held at the College Park Center in Arlington, Texas on December 10. The event will be held on the same day as WWE's NXT Deadline and UFC 282.\n\nStorylines\nThe event featured several professional wrestling matches, which involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers portray villains or heroes as they follow a series of events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines were produced on AEW's weekly television programs, Dynamite and Rampage, and AEW's supplementary online streaming shows, Dark and Elevation, as well as promotional videos on AEW's YouTube channel (as ROH has not yet secured its own television or streaming deal under Tony Khan).\n\nAt AEW Grand Slam, Chris Jericho defeated Claudio Castagnoli to win the ROH World Championship after delivering a low blow to Castagnoli. This would be Jericho's eight overall world championship in professional wrestling, hence his new moniker, \"The Ocho,\" briefly leaving his \"The Wizard\" moniker. Since precuring the title, Jericho vowed to destroy everything related to Ring of Honor before rebuilding it in his image, dubbing it \"Ring of Jericho.\" Additionally, Jericho would successfully defend the title against former Ring of Honor champions - including Bandido, Bryan Danielson, Dalton Castle, and Colt Cabana - though usually by utilizing some form of cheating. At Full Gear, Jericho would retain the title against Castagnoli, Danielson, and Sammy Guevara, pinning Castagnoli after a Judas Effect. On the November 25 episode of AEW Rampage, Castagnoli confronted the Jericho Appreciation Society, who were cutting a promo in the ring, and challenged Jericho to a rematch. Jericho initially refused, but after some convincing by JAS member Matt Menard, Jericho changed his mind and accepted the challenge for Final Battle on the condition that if Castagnoli loses the match, he would be forced to join the JAS.\n\nAt Death Before Dishonor, Wheeler Yuta of the Blackpool Combat Club successfully defended the ROH Pure Championship against Daniel Garcia of the Jericho Appreciation Society. Several weeks later on AEW Dynamite - held in Garcia's hometown of Buffalo, New York - Garcia defeated Yuta in a rematch to win the title. On the November 30 episode of Dynamite, during a sit-down interview with members of the BCC and JAS, Yuta challenged Garcia to a third match at Final Battle, which Garcia accepted.\n\nOn the November 18 edition of Rampage, Athena, who recently began having a new vicious streak, defeated Madison Rayne. Afterwards, as had now been commonplace for Athena, she continued attacking Rayne after the bout, even knocking down referee Aubrey Edwards when she tried to intervene. Athena would later be confronted by ROH Women's World Champion Mercedes Martinez, making her first televised appearance since Death Before Dishonor after suffering an injury. As a result of her attacking Edwards, Athena was suspended for a week. The following Friday on Rampage, Athena called out Martinez to put her championship on the line against her. On December 1, ROH announced that Martinez and Athena will wrestle for the title at Final Battle.\n\nOn the December 2 edition of Rampage, Keith Lee was set for a backstage interview before being confronted by former tag team partner Shane Taylor. Taylor would comment about how \"the business between you [Lee] and I [Taylor] is far from over,\" while asking about what it was with Lee leaving \"family.\" He would reference how he left former partner JD Griffey in the Texas independent scene, how he left Taylor in ROH when he signed with Evolve, and recently abandoning Swerve Strickland during the AEW World Tag Team Championship match at Full Gear. Taylor would later throw out a challenge to Lee for Final Battle, with he and Griffey facing Swerve In Our Glory. Strickland would then appear behind Lee as Taylor left, with a hesitant Lee asking if he can still trust Strickland.\n\nAt Supercard of Honor XV, FTR (Cash Wheeler and Dax Harwood) defeated The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) to capture the ROH World Tag Team Championship. Three months later at Death Before Dishonor, a rematch between the two teams took place, this time a two-out-of-three falls match. There, FTR defeated The Briscoes 2-1 to retain the titles. On the December 7 episode of Dynamite, FTR failed to win the AEW World Tag Team Championship when they were confronted by The Gunns (Austin Gunn and Colten Gunn), who appeared on the titantron. The Gunns would reveal a Christmas card signed in blood by The Briscoes, challenging them to one more match at Final Battle. As an added twist, The Gunns would later pull dog collars out of stockings, making the match a Double Dog Collar Match.\n\nEvent\n\nPre-show\nThere were four matches on the pre-show. In the opener, Máscara Dorada faced Jeff Cobb. In the end, as Dorada was looking for a springboard move, Cobb countered it into the Tour of the Islands for the win. \n\nNext, Parker and Menard took on the Shinobi Shadow Squad. The former won after performing a double spike DDT on Eli Isom for the win. \nNext, Willow Nightingale faced Trish Adora. In the end, Nightingale struck with a Pounce and the Doctor Bomb for the victory. \n\nIn the pre-show main event, The Kingdom (with Maria Kanellis-Bennett) faced Top Flight. In the closing stages, Darius Martin delivered a suicide dives to Mike Bennett and Matt Taven delivered a trust fall to Dante Martin. Dante and Darius then hit the Nosedive/Powerbomb combination on Bennett for the win.\n\nPreliminary matches\nThe opening contest on the main card was a tag team match between Blake Christian and AR Fox; and La Facción Ingobernable (with José the Assistant). In the closing stages, Dralístico delivered a springboard star press, which took out everyone. Christian then delivered a flipping DDT, and a 450° splash from Fox unto Dralístico, which gave them the victory. After the match, Rush and Dralístico attacked Christian and Fox. \n\nNext, Mercedes Martinez defended the ROH Women's World Championship against Athena. In the closing stages, Athena delivered a codebreaker, but Martinez touched the ropes. Athena then preceded to remove the turnbuckle pad. Athena then dropkicked Martinez into the exposed turnbuckle, then hit The Eclipse for the ROH Women's title.\n \nIn the next match, Swerve In Our Glory took on Shane Taylor Promotions. In the end, due to miscommunication, Swerve Strickland left his partner Keith Lee, allowing Shane Taylor and JD Griffey to beat up Lee. As Griffey wanted to hit Lee, he unintentionally took out Taylor, allowing Lee to deliver the Spirit Bomb for the win. \nNext, The Embassy (with Prince Nana) faced Dalton Castle and The Boys for the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship. The former won after Brian Cage delivered a pop-up powerbomb, to become the new champions. \n\nThe next match was a Pure Wrestling Rules match for the ROH Pure Championship, contested between defending champion Daniel Garcia and Wheeler Yuta. In the end, as Garcia was looking for a piledriver, Yuta escaped and locked in the arms of Garcia, giving way to a series of elbows to knock out Garcia, making Yuta the new champion.\n\nNext, FTR faced The Briscoes for the ROH World Tag Team Championship in a Double Dog Collar match. All teams started brawling at ringside. Mark Briscoe hit the Froggy Bow on Cash Wheeler for a two-count. As Wheeler was looking for a suplex onto a stack of chairs, Mark reversed it and suplexed Wheeler into the chairs. Dax Harwood then wrapped a chain around his hand and started punching Jay Briscoe. As Harwood was punching Jay, Jay pulled referee Mike Posey in front of him, which caused severe blood loss to Posey. As Jay was looking for the Jay Driller onto the chair, Wheeler delivered a low blow and delivered a piledriver to Jay onto the chairs. As Harwood as looking for a top rope piledriver, Jay blocked it and delivered a low blow to Harwood with the chain and hit a superplex onto the chairs. Jay then trapped Harwood in a chain-assisted crossface. As Wheeler wanted to enter the ring, Mark blocked him with the chain around Wheeler. With nowhere to go, Harwood tapped out, giving The Briscoes their record-setting 13th ROH World Tag Team Championship. After the match, both teams shook hands, as a sign of respect.  \n\nIn the penultimate match, Samoa Joe defended the ROH World Television Championship against Juice Robinson. Joe won after countering Robinson's top rope attempt and hitting the Muscle Buster\n\nMain event\nThe main event was for the ROH World Championship contested between Claudio Castagnoli and defending champion Chris Jericho, with the stipulation being that if Castagnoli loses, he must join the Jericho Appreciation Society. Jericho refused the Code of Honor to start the match. Jericho went for the Judas Effect, but Castagnoli countered it into the Neutralizer for a near fall. As Castagnoli was looking for the Ricola Bomb from the top rope, Jericho countered it into a hurricarana. Castagnoli hit an uppercut, but Jericho responded with a corner lariat. Jericho hit an uppercut, but Castagnoli started hitting multiple uppercuts. As he was going for a springboard uppercut, Jericho looked for a codebreaker, but Castagnoli countered it into a Big Swing attempt, but Jericho escaped. Jericho performed the Walls of Jericho, but Castagnoli reached the ropes. As Jericho was complaining to the referee, Castagnoli hit an uppercut. This brought out Matt Menard and Angelo Parker. As Parker was distracting the referee, Menard gave Jericho a bat and hit Castagnoli, but Castagnoli again kicked out. Jericho then hit the Codebreaker, and was setting up for the Judas Effect, but Castagnoli countered into the Giant Swing, swinging Jericho 30 times, forcing Jericho to submit, and crowning Castagnoli the new champion.\n\nResults\n\nSee also\n2022 in professional wrestling\nList of Ring of Honor pay-per-view events\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Final Battle 2022 Results at Ring of Honor\n\n2022 in professional wrestling\n2022 in Texas\nEvents in Arlington, Texas\n2022\nRing of Honor pay-per-view events\nProfessional wrestling in Texas\nDecember 2022 events in the United States", "unikey": "Final Battle (2022)", "summary": "The 2022 Final Battle was the 21st Final Battle professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH).

the vows list once the points are compiled there has not been a trio of matches to reach this level since 1989 when steamboat and flair made magic together the pinnacle of this trio of matches happened on 1210 very few people on the planet can do the things these four did in this match and live to tell about it let alone walk away from it dog collar matches can be overbooked and many times incredibly predictable it so happens that two of the best dogcollar matches ever happened in 2022 under the tutelage of tony khan this one is superior to all of them how jay brisco managed to continue the match after landing on the chairs stacked outside the ring is borderline miraculous dax takes a lot of criticism from fans but the pride he takes in his work is commendable cash wheeler may be the most underrated of the four because dax tends to take up a lot of oxygen between the two there arent a lot of accolades left to laud upon this match other than to say in thirty years it is likely we will still be talking about the historic significance of it chris colvinthe tag team of the year and their most fitting rivals somehow managed to top their previous allworld efforts theirs was a gritty visceral piece of art crafted in a wrestling ring blood and steel and danger fused together to make a most moving unforgettable match ryan dilbertftr sign off their greatest year with their greatest match a grotty violent ugly brawl with the best tag team of the 21st century closing the finest 3match arc since okadaomega mark robinsonsomehow they were able to top their previous encounters in their final one the dog collar match was fitting for the violence the briscoes are known for as well as the nods to history that ftr likes to include in their work greg parksi count the entire trilogy as one as i find them empirically inseparable this was the best one though evan schaafring of honor only had three shows this year but they were all highlighted by the amazing matches between the briscoes vs ftr supercard of honor saw the straight two vs two tag team bout while the rematch at death before dishonor was a 23 falls match we didnt know if we would get a third match but when it was revealed that the trilogy would indeed be complete and that it would also be a dog collar match the anticipation went through the roof when the dust settled what we got was arguably the best dog collar match in the history of prowrestling and the conclusion of one of the greatest trilogies in the history of prowrestling it was a total bloodbath with both teams leaving it all in the ring both figuratively and literally jay briscoe completely smashing the muta scale and mark briscoe taking that insane bump onto the pile of chairs on the floor are moments i will never forget the match was capped off with the briscoes the greatest tag team in ring of honor history winning the roh world tag team titles for an unprecedented thirteenth time a violent spectacle that well be talking about for a very long time sean sedora modern take on an 80s bloodbath matches and also the occasional awesome lucha brawl that still takes place today these two teams deserve a ton of credit for what they did throughout the year and having a true inring rivalry through 3 matches despite all the red tape they had to cut through to be allowed to wrestle each other on tape thankfully it culminated in an unforgettable fight i wouldnt at all be surprised if this is the top pick for 2022 among the majority as it was on cagematch dylan foxthis match made a cold ppv into one to really look forward to and boy they delivered this is one of the best matches in north americas wrestling history and the best usage of the dog collar stipulation ive ever seen a bloody masterpiece with painful looking landings into chairs the briscoes vs ftr is an early contender for the best feud of this new decade sharing spots with other tremendous pairings like hangman vs bryan mjf vs punk and kenny omega vs will ospreay diego garciaa perfect end to the trilogy all three could have easily been moty jon atkinsa bloody disgusting display of violence anger and hatred through pro wrestling jesse collingswhen the bell rang and the briscoes were victorious i knew not only that i watched the best dog collar match i had seen but also one of my favorite tag team matches it was raw violent brutal and just incredibly great action all around this match had the work to follow up one of the best matches of the year and in my opinion was better than their first match due to the urgency and the amped up violence the briscoes lost on their first match due to them wrestling more than once that day lost the second one since it was ftrs specialty but they won on where they excel at just pure amazing violence with spots you will never forget abraham delgado of all their incredible matches in 2022 this one felt a little outside of ftrs wheelhouse harwood and wheeler excel within the strict parameters of a tag team match we love watching them put plans into action strategising and bending the rules this bout had no tags to make and no rules to be broken but they and the briscoes still put on a grisly masterpiece everything about it is foul  the violence the language the blood even the official ended up covered in the red stuff surely the most memorable ref bump of the year all in all its not the prettiest or most thoughtful match of either teams back catalogue but its certainly one of the most distinctive jack g kingthis match was a once in a life time experience for me as someone that doesnt go to many live wrestling shows the crowd was heavily for ftr so i decided to chant for the briscoes but at the end of the day it didnt matter both teams went out there and put their lives on the line to have one of the greatest trilogies of all time manuel rosalesthe finale in the excellent ftr vs briscoes trilogy i had to place all 3 here as they were by far the best tag team matches i saw all year josiah macdonaldblood  guts liam jonesis it recency bias nah one of the wildest spectacles ever in the business these dudes beat the tar out of each other from start to finish but it wasnt just that creativity check nastiness check drama check anything you can think of this bad boy had it i can watch these dudes wrestle forever markeem grahamthere is no tag team that does everything perfect but ftr is damn close they maximized a team like the briscoes who has not really evolved or changed in recent years and this was a war jeff schwartzftr and the briscoes engaged in three fantastic matches  with two feeling like absolute alltime classics the third match in the trilogy was something that took each team to new heights and allowed ftr to truly thrive in a match that would have been right at home during the peak of jim crockett promotionsfor almost 40 years companies have chased moments that felt as visceral as magnum ta gouging a broken piece of a table into tully blanchards face and on this night they managed to go beyond just paying homage to their former manager  but surpassing him in a bloodbath that shocked all who saw it unfold the briscoes are no strangers to blood but ftr isnt really thought of as a freebleeding team and here they brought out their inner raging bull and unleashed hell on the briscoes in a dramatic battle that saw the briscoes get a muchneeded win after losing two straight to ftr but also saw the beginning of the downfall of ftrs belt collector era that continued into 2023 jeremy peepleslook no further for a cathartic and violent pro wrestling match the third in their series was always going to be a noteworthy affair but the dog collar stipulation added even more fuel to the fire it has to be one of the most brutal matches of the year impressively not the best match between ftr and the briscoes in 2022 but without a doubt one of the most vicious jamie johnsontag team wrestling in many promotions can be very hit and miss but when it hits it really hits and that was the case at this years final battle as the briscoe brothers took on ftr in a double dog collar match this was the blow off match in the feud between these two teams and boy did it deliver in a big way they started off with a feeling out process but that process didnt last too long because this match was a total war they went all out to give us the best match possible and the match definitely delivered on the hype it got this match is not for the squeamish as there was a lot of blood in fact mark briscoe got busted open after getting hit in the face with the dog collar in the first minute of the match this match had the live crowd in the palm of their hands from the opening bell and those of us who were watching at home were in awe of the match with each and every minute and each and every move ftr and the briscoes are both great tag teams in their own right and when you put the two together they make for amazing pro wrestling matches and that to me is what pro wrestling has always been about amazing chemistry amazing matches and emotion all of the emotion humanly possible for the fans in five to ten years people will go back and look at the series of matches that ftr and the briscoes had with each other and if they didnt realize how great they were then they will with time its one of those feuds and subsequent matches that make me proud to be a wrestling fan because matches like these are what pro wrestling is all about im happy to say that i was able to see this match live as it happened because it was something special do yourself a favor and go watch this match right now nathan neumanni had a tough time picking between this and the supercard of honor match as best match of the year its very close as this ended up being a bloody brutal fight with a ton of great moments will probably have to put supercard of honor ahead but not by much bryan rosethis is the kind of match that happens at the end of the year and makes you rip up your moty list and start again this is also the kind of match that has you wincing in terror while also hooting and hollering for more it was an incredibly violent war to conclude one of the greatest wrestling trilogies ever bring an end to ftrs heralded 2022 and remind everyone that the briscoes are still a toptier tag team it didnt matter that the match was announced only a few days out it didnt matter that one of the teams isnt even allowed on turner television as soon as we heard ftr vs the briscoes iii in a double dog collar match we knew these four guys would deliver a fitting finale and they did for all the bumps bruises and blood loss these guys put themselves through in this match they deserve all the votes they get andrew richftr had a lot of great matches this year and ive got three of them in my top 10 but this one surpassed them all the fourway blood had a lot to do with that you just dont see a lot of tag team dog collar matches usually reserved to settle singles feuds eric krolafter two previous fivestar matches in 2022 these two teams set the gold standard when it came to dog collar matches this was every bit as violent as you would have liked it to be along with mixing tremendous violent spots while building off of the first two matches this is arguably the best tag team trilogy of alltime  tyler fornesswhere the wheels start to come off for ftr as they attained greatness but couldnt sustain it forever and the final chapter in the story of the briscoes being made homeless and going on a voyage of wrestling discovery before finally being back where they belong and welcomed home with bloody violent arms truly a remarkable match for the effort and the story told as they tried to figure out how to top themselves for a third time mr james truepenny how do you take things to the next level after two highly praised tag matches a double dog collar blowoff bloodbath of course 2022 was the year of the blade in america and we got perhaps the greatest sendoff to that theme in the final major show of the year as the briscoes ftr and even the referee were all donning the crimson mask outside of dax taking an eternity to wrap the chain around his forehead for a headbutt this was a fantastic closing chapter to the feud of the year ed millsthe culmination of one of the greatest tag series of our generation while being probably the best dog collar match in decades supreme perfection jacob nelsontwo matches with the same opponents cracking a top ten list is special by itself but consider where ring of honor existed as an entity just a year ago and its even more extraordinary and extraordinary is precisely the adjective id use to describe the tag team rivalry between ftr and the briscoes in 2022 a rivalry that more than justified rohs return to live wrestling three mustsee matches between these two teams played a significant role in tony khanera roh finding strong business from ticket sales and payperview buys roh has a strong footing to stand on in 2023 thanks to a foundation that was poured by and soaked in the blood of jay and mark briscoe dax harwood and cash wheeler the best entry in that trilogy was this dog collar match at final battle fabulously brutal and violent and loaded with plenty of appeal for fans of both the new and old school philosophies well before even the opening bell the contrasting visuals of the briscoes entering in their black dusters while harwood and wheeler were dressed in their white gear told you everything you needed to know theres a reckoning coming these men are out for blood and its not going to end until bodies and wills have been broken what followed was exactly that with the briscoes and ftr emptying out everything in their respective playbooks while improvising even more barbarism around the stipulation of the match one of the most stunning examples of that barbarism is cash wheeler hanging mark briscoe with the chain while jay briscoe sends dax harwood into that taut chain  friendly fire affecting both teams but a sacrifice deemed necessary by both teams that is truly victory at all costs the extreme physical sacrifice by all four men was heightened by an electrified crowd and an excellent call by ian riccaboni and caprice coleman a commentary team that has become one of the most valuable assets for roh put it all together and its clear that ring of honor can not only survive but thrive in this new era tdethe violence in this match is just mesmeric to watch the intensity from the start tells you not to look away there is no pause in its relentlessness with dax and mark the mvps with an honourable mention for whoever decided that the chains should be longer because it helps discard the limitations that chainstrap match have to suffer maybe the best ref bump ever fire pro homage strategy call backs to previous matches and a finish that felt rewarding for the viewer rewatching this i again found myself repeatedly saying wow to myself my moty peter edgewhen you say violence you have to think about the dog collar match between the briscoes and ftr these tewo teams fought all over the place across the whole building and blood was spit in every corner of the squared circle we had great kickouts nearfalls big moments and even referees bled like the four combatants it was the perfect showing of a fight to death a fight until the last man was standing and a perfect way to end one of the best feuds of the year christian gascoignea perfect end to a trilogy of tag team matches that will sit with me for a long time the dog collar match was back in a big way this year and though i prefer the punkmjf match as a whole package this may be the better homage to the violent legacy of the stip as well as an awesome spectacle and a great match it served as a symbolic crescendo to a rivalry of two teams metaphorically and now literally tied to one another dave ryanan incredibly physical match that was a logical progression of the first two matches and was also unique ultimately put a capper on an all time 3 match series arturo gallettithe conclusion to the ftrbriscoes trilogy is the bloodiest of the three a true fight a slobberknocker a barnburner a piersixer and every other tired cliché in the book mark briscoe takes an all timer gnarly bump jay briscoe bleeds like five buckets dax harwood tries to wrap a chain around his bald head for what feels like two minutes and cash wheeler works like a madman to keep the whole thing together in short its awesome and a fitting end to the trilogy semi salmikannaswhile this match did not reach the euphonic highs for me that the first encounter between ftr and the briscoes did this match left me with an altogether different feeling where the first match was a struggle for preeminence between these two teams the third match was a brutal endurance contest and after having watched i felt a sort of exhaustion seeing the briscoes earn their current reign as roh tag team champions over the course of three matches in 2022 ftr and the briscoes felt like a bloodfeud rivalry that had already spanned the ages the double dog collar match was the logical conclusion to such antagonism the sort that felt that its lasted years longer than it did in truth the third match between ftr exchanged the tagteam prowess each team possessed from the first match and instead pit them in a smashmouth gladiator match and when it was all said and done we were witness to one of the most beautiful exhibitions of wrestling violence to be found in the modern era reuel castilloi mean another crazy brutal and good match between two of the top tag teams in the world filip pejicftr vs briscoes is without a doubt the best trilogy of 2022 this match is personally my favorite because the stipulation was perfect for both teams as they are the most intense teams ever it had a feeling of urgency blood sweat crazy spots violence everywhere what is incredibly satisfying in wrestling to me is a perfecttimed dramatic and epic finish which was the case here i will never forget cash trying to break the submission enzo fadelliold school and brutal they didnt let the gimmick lead the match avoiding contrived spots and hokeyness instead it enhanced the match this was pure nwa 87 both teams brought it and put their bodes on the line joe townerits hard to believe they could possibly match the greatness of their first encounter but in the eyes of many they exceeded it i try to avoid including the same pairing more than once on my match of the year list but i cant deny this one matthew carlinsmy personal favourite of the three broscoe ftr matches it helped being the big blow off match to finish the series and having call backs to all the prior also incredible i might add tag matches between these two there is some fun split screen production that helps us keep an eye on all of the action at once and adds to the chaotic nature of this match theres doomsday devices and diving headbutts with chains even the ref gets a chain shot to the face at one point busting him wide open ive never seen a ref cut busted open before mark briscoe takes a disgusting fall to ring side off the top onto a pile of chairs and then dax hits the piledriver on to a chair in the ring and goes for the cover like he did to win the prior match but jay manages to kick out this is great stuff add to this an almighty superplex to dax onto a pile of chairs and the fantastic cross face with the chain while cash is trying his hardest to break it up to finish to top off a violent masterpiece of a match between these two great teams ian riccaboni and caprice coleman also do a tremendous job in this match selling the violence putting over the action and helping to elevate it to another level steven i love tag team wrestling blake murphyrip jay briscoe skeach101brutal but beautiful hardcore but honorable devastating but definitive rest in peace jay briscoe slyguy46it seems crazy to me that a match that was such a perfect ending to the feud between these two teams came together only a week or so before it happened such an oldschool and potentially brutal stipulation could not have suited these two teams of tough southern rasslers more and on the night they defied the potential limitations the dual chains imposed crafting probably the best match of either teams career while the critical consensus focused a lot on dax and jay immediately afterwards i adored the work of cash  mark the pair utilised the chain to not only hit each other but drag each other around yank each other neck first off heights and ultimately in the final moments restrict each other the match of course now gains extra significance as the last match jay briscoe ever wrestled but even before that it was simply one of the best tag team matches of all time and easily one of the best matches this year sam brown i loved this match because they didnt try anything fancy  four guys just went out there and mauled each other all four of them were out for blood and they and by extension us got tons of it this is the defining rivalry of the year and ftr concludes their stellar 2022 george atsaveschris colgan 2022 wasnt just the year of the briscoesftr feud it was the year of the dog collar in one of the few wrestling match types wwe hasnt ruined tony khan used it so effectively in 2022 especially in the final match between these two teams this feud had so many things going against it so much so what we did get feels like a miracle the higher ups at wbd refused to let the briscoes be featured on tv the weeks heading into final battle werefine tony khan was putting together a nice little roh ppv then the gunn club pulled out dog collars of a christmasgiftlikestructure and the show became must see ftr and the briscoes would put a definitive end to their feud and it no doubt sold extra tickets and ppv buys the hype was so big and these 4 guys exceeded expectations at first i rated it around 4 stars my cohost talked me into 45 but the final stretch from dax felt so masturbatory nothing new to ftr matches after a rewatch i absolutely loved it everyone played their parts perfectly and the final third of the match was excellent despite daxs cringy heroic schtick this incredible match made ftr tag team of the year their set of matches the feud of the year and added another feather in the cap of the briscoes hall of fame case it also made it close to impossible for anyone else to have a better dog collar match jake haltermanas i wrote in my review of this show for vow this match was exactly what they advertised this wasnt a game of human chess there was no sign that any of these four men were thinking about their next move or setting up something for down the line this was four rabid wolves ripping and tearing at each other this was unbridled carnage and violence it was beautiful barbarism these were two of the best tag teams in the world leaving every bit of themselves in that ring and leaving nothing to chance they left every bit of themselves in that ring which helped to make this one of the most iconic matches in ring of honor history and the capper to one of the best rivalries in recent pro wrestling history suit williamstwo of the best tag teams in history delivering again kristen ashlya great end to the trilogy that will be studied by young wrestlers for years to come it was a bloodbath but not just for the sake of it the double dog collar factor of pairing off mark with wheeler and jay with harwood for the whole match could have been limiting but it elevated the match instead dave musgravea violent and bloody war between two teams two teams with great chemistry the trilogy between the briscoes and ftr was a perfect example of perfect tag team wrestling this is my top pick of best wrestling matches of 2022 franky dejesuslet this match live on in our memories forever more we will never forget the impact that jay had on wrestling and how special a team the briscoes are sarah flanneryone of the wildest brawls ive ever seen rip jay briscoe deanthis match has a tragic poetry to it now as jay briscoes last performance encapsulates his career a beautiful display of skill creativity and violence all lead to capturing the ring of honor world tag team titles which he and his brother mark have been synonymous with for two decades rest in peace jay briscoe jeff martinthis is a match showered in highly justifaible superlatives its been elevated into the pantheon of alltime great matches a clash of four men driven by the common bond of the love of pro wrestling and taking it to such great heights its the kind of stuff that makes watching this crazy sport worthwhile makes you thankful for wrestlers like these warren hayesit was already the definitive match of the best inring feud of the year now it will be known as jay briscoes final battle if there is one match that 2022 will be remembered for this is it rest in peace jamin pugh kevin elyim not a fan of dog collar matches but this is one of my favourite matches of all time it had a pace that just never stopped it was a fantastic intersection of high spots and story that had everyone cheering for whichever team they supported personally i was all in of the briscoes the intensity of mark and jay was as similar as it was different and their reality was highlighted perfectly by the nostalgic trappings of ftr a wonderful alltime match forever tinged with sadness neil davidthank you jay kentucky210 austin halla perfect capper to an alltimer of a trilogy that brought heart violence hatred respect sacrifice and storytelling to a shattering crescendo chrisi watched this masterpiece very sadly only after jays passing i had forgotten how sad his death was a few minutes in absorbed by the violence and physicality only for my brain to be shocked back to reality when cash yelled fucking murder him and i thought is this too soon for my emotions for a split second only for my brain to auto coreect itself and say no jay would have loved that moment this is the kind of shit he wants to be remembered for this ftrbriscoes feud only lasted 3 matches across one year and i can barely think of a modern tag feud capable of knocking it from its perch at the top of the heap what a way to be remembered what a gift to leave with those who love tag team wrestling james nuclearconvoy snelgrovewith the advent of aew a lot of people in my life have become new or reborn wrestling fans whether through the company or through diving back into the weeds of wrestling internet talk theyve slowly started becoming familiar with the cast of strange obscure characters ive been spending my free time with naturally after the series with ftr garnered all that hype they began asking me about the briscoes then the car accident happened sharing a drink with one of those friends he said he was bummed he never got around to familiarizing himself with the briscoes after all he loves ftr and if a team was having matches that good with ftr he wanted to check them out that night he said he was going to watch the dog collar match my first instinct was to say no dont start there i started thinking about all the years id spent watching briscoes matches the series where they unseated aries and strong seeing them keep up with a prime naruki doi and shingo in the uk trading strikes with takashi sugiura in japan establishing steenerico in the united states generational feuds with the likes of the motor city machine guns kings of wrestling and the young bucks it went on and on then i thought about what it is in all those special matches that made you say were lucky we get to watch these guys and i realized its all here in the dog collar match the intensity the spectacle the violence the chemistry that only siblings can share and a worldclass pair of opponents its a joy to watch professional wrestling when it looks like this its one of the best matches ive ever seen yeah you should definitely go watch that fuckin match i said jon hernandez a brilliant bloody spectacle that stands as the absolute pinnacle of tag team wrestling andrew sinclairftr and the briscoes on this night produced beautiful violence from bell to bell this was all out violence i will never forget watching from the referee spot to dax using wrapping the chain around his head hatred fueled this match and this is what a blow off match should be daniel kuchlerthis was my feud of the year and i didnt think anything could top seeing the second match live but this one was just better where the second one was great enough to make me a briscoes fan for the better part of two decades want ftr to win this was the brutal cathartic victory of the briscoes i really wanted mongo underscore ebooksabsolute nutty this was violent and bloody and incredible probabbly would have been higher if he story resonated with me more but i cant deny these men had an incredible match christopher duartea wild and bloody war both teams fight right at the bell and waste no time trying to hurt each other fighting on the floor stage and even crowd and throwing everything that isnt nailed down at each other briscoes are the first to be able to mount any kind of double team offense before dax is able to run jay into a chair and cash is able to pull mark down by his chain ftr takes over and beats the hell out of dem boys including hitting a doomsday device for a nice early nearfall a blood soaked jay starts swinging the chain around like a mad man to help the briscoes take back over mark and cash battle on the floor while dax and jay duke it out in the ring all four men are covered in blood even the referee gets caught in the crossfire and busted open mark is pulled off the top into a pile of chairs when going for a doomsday device jay driller only gets 2 and so does a piledriver by dax a top rope piledriver is stopped and jay superplexes both men onto a pile of chairs cash tries to get in the ring but mark is holding the chain and preventing it jay starts to choke dax out with the chain as the two partners reach for each other referee has to call it briscoes are the tag team champions again after one of the most insane matches i have ever seen alexander charles kalilone of the greatest tag team matches of all time one of the reasons 2022 will go down as one of the best years for inring action that ive ever witnessed the fact that ftr and the briscoes managed to top their first encounter is a credit to how amazing these two teams are the double dog collar match didnt need weeks of build  after all it was named days before the show actually happened all we needed was to know their history and that this was going to be a war the blood the moments and the finish make this a match that people will be talking about for years the struggle of dax harwood reaching for cash wheeler as he faded was the close this series needed pro wrestling as good as it gets scott edwardsits refreshing to see a critically acclaimed match from a us promotion that isnt trying to win the palme dor instead its focused on being a gritty flatout fight the chains are attached and they brawl immediately and along with it the blood quickly followed as well punches with chains wrapped around the fist are plenty whippings take place and tons of choking to boot but all behind it was the visceral hatred and violence in not only their actions but body language from all four the match had some clever spots that youd expect as well cash threw mark briscoe to the outside from over the top to hang him and dax tried to clothesline jay on the chain that has now been straightened but jay reverses and dax takes the rough landing into the chains though there is a spot where jay briscoe pulls the ref in front of him to protect himself from an incoming chain shot which spit the ref open it was slightly gratuitous i must say but the wrestling resumed quickly so there was no time to dwell on it and thankfully the finish didnt come too soon after that giving the match a nice compact feel to a hard hitting tough match exactly as it should be comparing it to other chain matches such as my personal favourite pitbulls vs stevie richards and raven from ecw gangster paradise 1995 this is below it but out of the trilogy that these two have had its the superior one of the lot mc voices of wrestling 2022 match of the year full

match mjfs music then hit and he headed to the ring with a josh allen jersey on he celebrated with taz and posed with fans along the rampway when he got in the ring he dropped to his knees and made the announcement that the devil is back he asked the crowd if they are excited to see mjf and called josh allen the greatest qb of all time he praised buffalo and brought up the fact that the last time they saw him he said some offensive stuff mjf tried to play it off like he was just kidding and said he loved this place and would never go anywhere he started an aew chant and said he didnt mean it when he called them all stupid marks mjf then encouraged the crowd to chant for themselves because without them there wouldnt be an mjf he then insulted an obese woman in the crowd and immediately

you know it chant jon moxleys music hit and he came out to greet mjf through the crowd he had a microphone in hand and they stood a few feet apart moxley told him he was absolutely full of crap mjf asked if he thought he wasnt being sincere in front of all these grotesque lardasses with the worst football team in all of america he then wiped his ass with the josh allen jersey and threw it into

make him leave mjf took off his scarf and his shirt comedically and then left moxley told him his theme music sucks he then said he was pissed off and embarrassed about a good many things but mostly about no longer being the aew world champion he said it represents passion for this sport passion for this business the passion of the people in the back and of the fans in the arena moxley said the three letters in the aew championship represent the heroes the world needed during the pandemic and the death of the dark parts of the business that should have been left behind in another generation and it represents everything that he loves about professional wrestling he said the fact remains on sunday that he lost and thats on him and he was supposed to be on vacation until about two days ago moxley said this tournament is another chance to push the rock up the hill one more time he put over the other competitors in the tournament moxley said the best players always want the ball and this was his time to take the ball and run with it he said now was the time to become a legend he then celebrated briefly and headed back up the ramp the announce team ran down the card for the remainder of the show the trios title match is up next death triangle made their entrance first followed by the best friends my take incredibly strong performances from both moxley and mjf that accomplished a few different things mjf is established as the next threat to the tournament winner and moxley did his best to return some honor to the company after the disgraceful proceedings that took place after the ppv mjf was very entertaining in firing up the crowd before gutting them and moxley was very sincere in his disgust over what had happened over the past few days 1 death triangle pac rey fenix penta el zero miedo walex abrahantes vs best friends orange cassidy trent beretta chuck taylor for the vacant aew trios championships penta and orange cassidy began the match and taunted one another a bit penta took off one of his gloves and tossed it to alex at ringside orange cassidy took off his glasses and tossed them to danhausen and put his hands in his pockets penta kicked him in the gut but cassidy responded by taking penta down with a flying headscissors all six men ended up in the ring and best friends were cleared from the ring they quickly reentered and sent death triangle to ringside and then orange cassidy dove on all three men at ringside pac worked over trent as the show returned trent fired back with some chops and a double stomp orange cassidy tagged in and was caught with a hard back elbow from pac danhausen jumped on the apron and pointed at pac abrahantes pulled him off the apron and danhausen cursed him and punched him in the balls pac then went to ringside and took out danhausen with a pump kick cassidy recovered and landed a cross body on pac followed by a tornado ddt chuck taylor tagged in and tossed fenix into penta in the corner they looked to knock heads awkwardly but seemed to be ok penta delivered a slam and covered chuck for a two count the announce team said swerve in our glory will have a rematch with the acclaimed at arthur ashe trent and chuck gave each other a hug trent landed a tornado ddt on fenix pac and fenix then cleared trent from the ring after a bit of chaos fenix landed an assisted code red on trent for a close near fall orange cassidy returned to land an orange punch on penta trent landed the awful waffle but pac broke up the pin all six men recovered and got to their respective corners there was a triple canadian destroyer from death triangle onto the best friends fenix and penta followed up with dives on cassidy and trent on the floor pac landed the black arrow on chuck and got the win death triangle defeated best friends at 1137 to win the aew trios championships backstage dark order was interviewed preston 10 vance was offered another contract by andrades assistant jose and they were rebuffed by uno and john silver vance never refused himself andrade walked up and said something i didnt quite catch even the dark order seemed confused about what it was about he tossed vance a crutch my take death triangle are a natural replacement for the elite as trios champions the lack of any story about the absence of cm punk and the elite is a bit odd though are viewers supposed to think they were needed back on their home planets a video recap was shown of the result of the interim aew womens championship match from sunday hayter was shown wheeling her luggage past britt baker and refused to speak to her after the match in the arena penelope ford made her entrance and kip sabian joined at ringside with a box on his head toni storm then made her ring entrance to a solid reaction 2 interim aew womens champion toni storm vs penelope ford wkip sabian in a championship eliminator ford made a clever escape from a head scissors which seemed to impress storm both women traded headlocks and escapes ford offered a handshake which she used to pull ford in for a shoulder tackle storm knocked ford down in the corner and set up for a hip attack but ford moved out of the way both women ended up on the floor where ford sent storm into the ring steps ford controlled the action during the break but storm made a comeback once the show returned she landed a strong forearm that dropped ford in the corner ford seemed to attempt a northern light suplex but storm awkwardly reversed and then got the pin im not sure if there was an injury there or just an awkward spot interim aew womens champion toni storm defeated penelope ford at 559 after the match we got a video package that se tup action bronson and hook confronting 20 at arthur ashe stadium the acclaimed made their entrance in the arena before they could finish the entrance swerve interrupted them to prevent caster from rapping he asked if the crowd was there to hear more corny rap jokes and they cheered swerve said he had a joke for themand they started an asshole chant the joke was the acclaimed as aew tag champions billy gunn then interrupted and said it wasnt swerves house anymoreit was daddy asss house bowens reiterated that the uncrowned champions the acclaimed would take on swerve in our glory at arthur ashe and he then did the scissor me daddy ass bit chris jericho is up next my take the crowd was hot that caster didnt get to rap but it definitely helped get heat on swerve that he didnt storm and ford had a decent match but i wouldnt call it a good one the finish was very awkward chris jericho and anna jay stood with sammy guevara and tay conti backstage tony schiavone conducted the interview jericho said the jas was better than ever he told the story of ponce de leon searching for the fountain of youth but said he found it and called himself the best sports entertainer ever he said he would beat bryan danielson next week news to hangman page and that sammy guevara would beat darby allin on friday he called aew his company and that no one could take it away from him jericho called sammy and daniel garcia his sons in the locker room and told garcia that he was on his own later against wheeler yuta guevara commented on how sexy he and jerichos abs are wardlow made his entrance in the arena mark sterling was in the ring with challenger tony nese this match is for the tnt championship 3 wardlow vs tony nese wmark sterling for the tnt championship after a headbutt and a symphony of powerbombs wardlow made quick work of perennial loser tony nese wardlow defeated tony nese at 059 to retain the tnt championship after the match wardlow pulled mark sterling into the ring and set up to give him a powerbomb but josh woods made the save after the match wardlow said hes been hearing a lot on the internet that wardlow has lost his momentum and he should do this and that he thanked his fans that had stuck with him since day one and reminded his critics that this is wardlows world after the promo we got a video package that hyped up darby allin and sammy guevara for rampage this week in the arena bryan danielson made his entrance followed by hangman page my take i cant believe jericho spoiled the finish to page and danielson what a blunder its nice of wardlow to remind me that im an internet asshole who said he had lost momentum 4 bryan danielson vs hangman page in a wild card match in the aew world title tournament the match began with some mat wrestling and reversals after 90 seconds of that danielson backed page in the corner and slapped him on the chest hangman replied with some chops but danielson quickly took him down and set up for a surfboard lock instead he just decided to stomp on hangmans knees they then traded chops and kicks with danielson getting the better of it danielson climbed to the top rope but was given a forearm that knocked him out to the apron hangman then followed up with a slingshot clothesline that dumped danielson to the floor hangman attempted a dive to the floor but missed danielson applied a hammer lock and then sent page into the ring post hangman took control and landed a hard lariat in the corner he followed up with a death valley driver and covered for a two count hangman continued to get some boos from the crowd danielson fired back with corner dropkicks on the third attempt hangman attempted a pop up powerbomb but danielson reversed into a head scissors takeover he then followed up with a series of kicks to the shoulder and head bryan went up to the top rope but hangman quickly recovered and knocked him into a seated position both men fought on the top rope and page pulled danielson into the ring with a leaping slam page setup for a buckshot lariat but danielson rolled out of the ring to recover page and danielson both rose to their feet and traded strikes page managed to land a sit out powerbomb for a close near fall both men showed signs of fatigue hangman placed danielson on the top rope and climbed to meet him there danielson slipped out and hung him in the tree of woe he then landed a baseball slide dropkick and pulled hangman back up to a seated position danielson then went for an avalanche back suplex but hangman landed on his feet he then followed up with a lariat for a near fall danielson managed to pull hangman into position for the lebell lock page escaped but bryan landed a butterfly suplex and quickly transitioned from an armbar back into the lebell lock page rotated out again and landed some knee strikes both men got back to their feet and traded some strikes bryan attempted what appeared to be a sunset flip but hangman countered into a deadeye for a close near fall page climbed to the top rope and attempted a moonsault but danielson got out of the way he then landed a busaiku knee but hangman landed near the ropes and rolled out of the ring bryan attempted to dive at hangman at ringside but was caught and slammed into the ring apron hangman shoved him into the ring and went for a buckshot lariat but danielson avoided it and rolled up hangman with an oconnor roll for the win bryan danielson defeated hangman page at 2304 to advance to the semifinals of the tournament for the vacant aew world championship after the match danielson looked at the aew world championship we then got a video package for jungle boy and christian it was revealed that christian left to have some surgery and jungle boy said he just prolonged the inevitable he then turned his attention to luchasaurus and said he had been left with no choice but to destroy him my take a very good match that was spoiled by jerichos mistake earlier itll be interesting to see if they pull the trigger on danielson as champion given his injury history i have to assume it will be him and moxley in the finals aew is doing a better job with adding more transitions and video packages to the show tonight stokely hathaway stood on the stage and said everybody wants an explanation for what he did at all out somebody walked from off screen and told stokely they didnt have time to do this stokely told him that when he has a microphone he is owed the same respect as that mans father stokelys crew consisted of the gunn brothers lee moriarty w morrissey and ethan page destroyed the production assistant curiously mjf was not present the announce team plugged darby allin and sammy guevara for rampage claudio castagnoli vs dax harwood and an appearance from samoa joe for fridays aew rampage we got a video package for dax vs claudio jericho vs danielson and moxley vs guevara or allin will happen next week on dynamite wheeler yuta vs daniel garcia is next westside gunn provided entrance music for daniel garcia caprice coleman joined on commentary along with william regal wheeler yuta then made his ring entrance judges jerry lynn bj whitmer and matt sydal were shown at ringside apparently sydal had to fill in because all of the other producers are suspended 5 wheeler yuta vs daniel garcia for the ring of honor pure championship i believe the match result is forfeit because they didnt shake hands to start the match garcia landed a shoulder block as the crowd went crazy for him as the hometown guy wheeler picked his leg and applied an ankle lock of sorts garcia broke free and they had a shoving match both men traded holds without gaining a clear advantage yuta landed a flying elbow from the top garcia fired up with a hard slap and then landed a back suplex he followed up with a lariat and covered for a near fall yuta avoided the dragonslayer sharpshooter and landed a series of german suplexes after a series of standing switches wheeler yuta ate a german suplex from the second rope that looked like it damn near killed him both men got to their feet and climbed back to the top rope they traded strikes and garcia pulled yuta back into the ring with a superplex both men struggled to their feet and then frantically traded slaps garcia landed a big kick and called for a standing ten count yuta made it to his feet at eight and then garcia applied the dragontamer yuta used one of his rope breaks to escape the hold yuta landed a closed fisted punch and received a warning from the referee garcia pulled yuta into a dragontamer again but yuta escaped and applied a crossface he transitioned into a seatbelt pin for a near fall garcia applied the dragontamer again yuta attempted to escape by cranking garcias neck but could not and had to tap out daniel garcia defeated wheeler yuta for the roh pure title at 1612 after the match bryan danielson walked out and entered the ring yuta shoved him away at first and shook garcias hand danielson then grabbed the pure championship belt and clasped it across the waist of garcia danielson then shook garcias hand and raised it into the air jericho walked out onto the stage and was unhappy that garcia had participated in the celebration my take a strong main event but im curious how it does in the ratings with relatively low star power in comparison with the danielson vs page match that came before it yuta and garcia are both future stars if they can continue to add personality and promo success to their already strong in ring performances overall this was a very odd episode of dynamite that did its best to avoid the controversies that had been driving the news the past few days given

live december 10 2022 on aewroh social media platforms arlington texas at college park center the preshow opened with a video package ian riccaboni and caprice coleman checked in on commentary from ringside coleman said this event may catapult them into a new era and the fans get to witness it they turned things over to ring announcer bobby cruise who introduced the wrestlers for the first match 1 mascara dorada vs jeff cobb the wrestlers adhered to the code of honor with a prematch handshake dorada fka gran metalik sent cobb to ringside early on and dove at him but cobb caught him and slammed him into the ring post before dumping him onto the apron cobb stood on dorada on the floor before tossing him back inside the ring and then standing on top of him again dorada avoided a charging cobb who crashed and burned into the corner dorada followed up with a headscissors takedown that sent cobb to the floor dorada performed a corkscrew dive over the top rope and onto cobb at ringside dorada threw cobb back inside the ring and then performed a springboard senton onto him for a two count cobb came back and performed a standing moonsault for a near fall cobb went for his finisher but dorada countered into a pin for a two count dorada went for a springboard move which cobb cut off with a punch cobb stood on the middle rope and powered up dorada who slipped away and threw a kick to cobbs back dorada went back to the ropes and pulled cobb to the mat with a bulldog style move that led to a two count cobb battled back with a shot to the back of doradas head then hit his tour of the islands finisher and scored the pin cobb and dorada shook hands afterward jeff cobb defeated mascara dorada in 700 powells pov a good match as much as i would have enjoyed seeing more from these two i like that they kept it brief given that they were opening the show a video package aired on the roh sixman tag title match that will be held on the main card mercedes martinez and athena were featured in a lengthy video package to push their roh womens championship match for the main card 2 angelo parker and matt menard vs shinobi shadow squad cheeseburger and eli isom the referee called for a handshake parker flashed a toothy grin while shaking isoms hand and then then continued to shake until isom pulled his hand away menard tagged in and shook isoms hand in an over the top manner there was a loud cheeseburger chant when he tagged into the match for the first time parker demanded that cheeseburger shake his hand cheeseburger did a mega powers wind up and then caught parkers foot when parker tried to kick him the heel duo isolated cheeseburger cheeseburger escaped the heel corner and then tagged in isom who had a flurry of offense that included a spear into the corner where both opponents were standing isom performed a popup neckbreaker on parker and then cheeseburger stomped him cheeseburger called for his palm strike and then ran the ropes and tumbled through the ropes when menard held a rope down from the floor menard entered the ring and joined parker in performing a double ddt on isom parker covered isom for the win angelo parker and matt menard defeated shinobi shadow squad cheeseburger and eli isom in 555 powells pov nothing memorable but this was fine for the preshow parker and menard had some good double team moves cheeseburger remains a popular figure with roh fans isom appeared to be on the verge of getting a push prior to the roh sale but it hasnt carried over under new management a video package aired on the roh pure rules title match between daniel garcia and wheeler yuta 3 willow nightingale vs trish adora adora had to play to the crowd to get them to respond during her entrance but the fans came to life when willow came out the wrestlers adhered to the code of honor with a handshake there were brief dueling chants willow slammed adora and then performed a running crossbody clock that resulted in an early two count adora fired back with a chop and then executed a nice northern lights suplex for a two count willow fired back a short time later with a couple of clotheslines and a series of chops willow performed a middle dropkick from the middle rope and picked up a two count adora pulled willow from behind into a pin willow sold the back of her head and neck willow came back with a pounce willow lowered the straps of her gear and then powered up adora for a nasty looking sitout powerbomb for the win the wrestlers hugged and shook hands afterward willow nightingale defeated trish adora in 600 powells pov a solid match nightingales charisma is undeniable adora has improved since the roh womens championship tournament and it was good to see her on the card by the way the video package on the roh womens championship match was given more time than typical rohaew video packages and did a good job of setting the table for their match a video package spotlighted the samoa joe vs juice robinson match for the roh tv title a video package aired on chris jericho vs claudio castagnoli for the roh championship 4 the kingdom matt taven and mike bennett wmaria kanellis vs top flight dante martin and darius martin riccaboni noted that taven worked in mexico just fourteen hours earlier the teams adhered to the code of honor while dante and bennett were on the verge of locking up taven hit dante from behind and then bennett took a cheap shot at darius which drew boos from the crowd later darius took offensive control but kanellis stood on the apron to distract him which led to taven and bennett getting the better of him bennett performed a spinebuster and then taven followed up with a springboard moonsault onto darius bennett catapulted darius into a knee strike from taven who followed up with an elbow from the ropes onto darius who was on the knees of bennett nice combination darius eventually fired back with a series of strikes on bennett who poked his eyes darius performed a standing spanish fly and then made the hot tag dante put taven down and then performed a standing moonsault that produced a two count darius made a blind tag and put taven down with a ddt style move for a two count darius followed up by pushing off of his brother before hitting a tornado ddt on taven but bennett broke up the pin the heel duo came back taven hit just the tip on darius and then bennett covered him for a near fall moments later darius hit bennett with a dive taven followed up with a great dive onto darius dante was supposed to hit the grand finale dive but he slipped on the ropes damn dante threw taven back inside the ring and was distracted by kanellis climbing onto the apron referee mike posey ejected kanelllis from ringside the heel duo set up for a spike piledriver on darius but it was broken up darius held up bennett in powerbomb position but then dante performed a springboard backflip into a dive on the elevated bennett darius covered bennett and got the three count top flight dante martin and darius martin defeated the kingdom matt taven and mike bennett in 1120 the two teams shook hands afterward taven and bennett raised the arms of the martin brothers a
