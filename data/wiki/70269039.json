A total of 102 deputies were elected in Minsk. Some 105,000 civilians and 24,000 soldiers were eligible to vote. The election was preceded by an active election campaign, with campaign rallies, campaigns vehicles crossing through the city and buildings covered by posters for the different candidate lists. The voting occurred in orderly fashion, with voters queuing for hours from the early morning. The socialist parties formed a majority coalition after the election, with the Bundist Arn Vaynshteyn becoming the new city duma chairman.\n\nContemporary political context of this election: events of July 1917\n\nIn July 1917 (Julian calendar), the 2nd Machine Gun Regiment, supported by the Bolsheviks, refused to send men to the World War I front and marched around the factories until they had \"tens of thousands\" marching with them to the Executive Committee of the Soviets in Petrograd. The government was afraid; there were power shifts there, and defences were prepared. 500,000 workers and soldiers demonstrated in Petrograd, encouraged by Vladimir Lenin, and there was a general strike. The demonstrators were persuaded to return home, but the government was now on the offensive. The printing machines and buildings of Pravda were destroyed, and some of its employees killed. The Bolshevik Committee's premises were \"ransacked\" and the situation elevated almost to martial law, with supporters of the Bolsheviks and of Lenin arrested if identified. The government set up a siege around 120 Kronstadt sailors and a group of Red Guards (factory workers' militia). Stalin mediated, the general strike ended, and the sailors went home. However, a \"massive show of force\" of Stalin's soldiers took over Petrograd. The head of government, Georgy Lvov, resigned, leaving Alexander Kerensky to make \"false promises\" in an attempt to broker peace, while Lenin retreated to an unspecified location. To discourage rebellious soldiers who were fighting to quell the rebellion, drumhead court-martials and summary executions for retreating at the front were permitted by the government. Meanwhile, although Minsk was close to the World War I front line, and although it had been involved in political struggles and changes, including taking in a great influx of refugees to help with agriculture, during July 1917 it was at peace in that it was not a theatre of war or revolution.\n\nParties in the fray\n\nList 1 – Russian Nationalists\nList 1 won three seats in the city duma, Valentin Minich was the faction head.
