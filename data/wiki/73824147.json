After the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL) missed the playoffs for the first time in 16 years, the Celtics enter the season in second place behind the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB) for the longest active playoffs streak in major North American sports, at nine years (having last missed the playoffs in 2014). \n\nThis is the first season without long time Celtic and point guard Marcus Smart, whose tenure spanned 9 seasons from 2014 to 2023. In June of 2023, Smart was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team trade to acquire forward Kristaps Porzingis of the Washington Wizards. On October 1, 2023, the Celtics sent guard Malcolm Brogdon, center/forward Robert Williams III, a protected 2024 first-round pick (acquired from the Golden State Warriors), and an unprotected 2029 first-round pick to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for 2-time All-Star guard Jrue Holiday of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nDraft \n\nThe Celtics had a second-round pick in the 2023 NBA draft. The team traded their first-round pick (29th overall) to the Indiana Pacers as part of a deal to acquire Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nRoster\n\nStandings\n\nDivision\n\nConference\n\nGame log\n\nPreseason \n\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 1\n| October 8\n| Philadelphia\n| \n| Payton Pritchard (26)\n| Jayson Tatum (10)\n| Jayson Tatum (5)\n| TD Garden19,156\n| 1–0\n|- style=\"background:#fcc\"\n| 2\n| October 9\n| @ New York\n| \n| Payton Pritchard (21)\n| Hauser, Stevens (8)\n| Payton Pritchard (5)\n| Madison Square Garden19,512\n| 1–1\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 3\n| October 11\n| @ Philadelphia\n| \n| Payton Pritchard (17)\n| Brissett, Mykhailiuk (6)\n| Derrick White (4)\n| Wells Fargo Center20,497\n| 2–1\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 4\n| October 17\n| New York\n| \n| Jayson Tatum (28)\n| Porziņģis, Tatum (8)\n| Jaylen Brown (6)\n| TD Garden19,156\n| 3–1\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\n| 5\n| October 19\n| @ Charlotte\n| \n| Jaylen Brown (20)\n| Kristaps Porziņģis (12)\n| Payton Pritchard (8)\n| Spectrum Center12,590\n| 4–1\n\nRegular season\nThis became the first regular season where all the NBA teams competed in a mid-season tournament setting due to the implementation of the 2023 NBA In-Season Tournament.\n\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 1\n| October 25\n| @ New York\n| \n| Jayson Tatum (34)\n| Jayson Tatum (11)\n| Jaylen Brown (5)\n|Madison Square Garden19,812\n| 1–0\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 2\n| October 27\n| Miami\n| \n| Derrick White (28)\n| Holiday, Horford (10)\n| Jrue Holiday (7)\n|TD Garden19,156\n| 2–0\n|- style=\"background:#cfc\"\n| 3\n| October 30\n| @ Washington\n| \n| Jaylen Brown (36)\n| Sam Hauser (8)\n| Derrick White (8)\n| Capital One Arena17,898\n| 3–0\n\n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 4\n| November 1\n| Indiana\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 5\n| November 4\n| @ Brooklyn\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Barclays Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 6\n| November 6\n| @ Minnesota\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Target Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 7\n| November 8\n| @ Philadelphia\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Wells Fargo Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 8\n| November 10\n| Brooklyn\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 9\n| November 11\n| Toronto\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 10\n| November 13\n| New York\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 11\n| November 15\n| @ Philadelphia\n| \n| \n|\n|\n| Wells Fargo Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 12\n| November 17\n| @ Toronto\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Scotiabank Arena\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 13\n| November 19\n| @ Memphis\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| FedExForum\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 14\n| November 20\n| @ Charlotte\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Spectrum Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 15\n| November 22\n| Milwaukee\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 16\n| November 24\n| @ Orlando\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Amway Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 17\n| November 26\n| Atlanta\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 18\n| November 28\n| Chicago\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n\n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 19\n| December 1\n| Philadelphia\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 20\n| December \n| \n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 21\n| December \n| \n|\n|\n|\n|\n| \n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 22\n| December 12\n| Cleveland\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 23\n| December 14\n| Cleveland\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 24\n| December 15\n| Orlando\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 25\n| December 17\n| Orlando\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| TD Garden\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 26\n| December 19\n| @ Golden State\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Chase Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 27\n| December 20\n| @ Sacramento\n| \n|\n|\n|\n| Golden 1 Center\n| \n|- style=\"background:#\"\n| 28\n| December 23\n| @ L.A.
