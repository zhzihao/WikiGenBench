The album was met with positive reviews by critics.\n\nRecording and release\nSongs of Bob Dylan continued a theme of covering and reinterpreting Dylan's music by Osborne, including changing musical style and the gender of the character in the narratives of the songs. She first recorded this set after being approached by Café Carlysle to do a residency and Osborne supported the album with a tour and cabaret show of Dylan's music that included songs from throughout his multi-decade career.\n\nReception\nThe editorial staff of AllMusic Guide scored Songs of Bob Dylan four out of five stars, with reviewer Mark Deming writing that \"she demonstrates she has a real knack for bringing his words to life\", highlighting the emotional depth of her vocal performance. Hal Horowitz of American Songwriter gave this album four out of five stars, commenting on the diversity of Osborne's selections and her reinterpretations of Dylan's music, summing up that \"she sheds new light on old material, exposes some seldom heard Dylan gems and proves once again how flexible and powerful his work remains\". Hayden Benfield notes for Renowned for Sound that \"a few of the tracks may arguably adhere too closely to the originals, bordering on imitation except for the vocals... it is clear how Osborne has earned her reputation as a deft cover artist when not performing originals\" and praises the album's high quality.\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by Bob Dylan, except where noted\n\"Tangled Up in

fasano joan osborne has been covering bob dylan for her entire career ever since she recorded the oh mercy deep cut man in the long black coat for her multiplatinum 1995 debut relish in the two decades since the nobel prizewinning songwriter has always remained a source for inspiration for osborne who regularly performs dylans material onstage and once again included a rendition of one of his songs  1997s make you feel my love  on 2000s righteous love i dont think its hyperbole to talk about dylan as an artist whos on the same level as pablo picasso or william shakespeare osborne tells rolling stone hes really an epic poet of america and any singer can find such an incredible wealth and richness in his material not just me we recently spoke with osborne about her new album what shes learned from bob dylan and how she put her own feminist spin on tangled up in blue which is premiering below editors picks the 250 greatest guitarists of all time the 500 greatest albums of all time the 50 worst decisions in movie history the 100 best albums of 2023 tangled up in blue is such an iconic dylan tune how did you go about approaching that songit wasnt until later in the process that i started to think about doing tangled up in blue during rehearsals for the residency we were doing at cafe carlyle we started off with just the drums and began experimenting with more of a soul rhythm we ended up listening to dusty springfields dusty in memphis some of the classic memphis recordings of that time to see if we could flavor the dylan song with some of that stuff its a very lengthy song and thats why people tend to do it at this rapidfire pace to get this epic story out there but i wanted something that would put a different spin on it i wanted to give it a more feminist spin a different kind of energy trending how nfl great aaron rodgers lost touch with reality twitter explodes with antisemitic misinfo after secret tunnel found under nyc synagogue protesters crash trump rally call him climate criminal watch true detective night country premiere murder and mysticism the slower tempo in your rendition really changes the emotional core of the songif you listen to the lyrics dylan was using this really interesting technique of looking at a story from different viewpoints it seems like the narrator is reaching back into his memory and these are all things that happens in the past except for that final verse when he sings im going back to find this person again there was a quality that the soul rhythm gave to the story of this being a fond reminiscence theres a bit of tenderness too which was something i felt was interesting to bring out in particular the verse where he sings she lit a burner on a stove and offered me a pipe thats such an intimate moment in the story and i felt like the soul groove gave me a chance to emphasize that intimacy and bring down the volume and tell the story in this very tender way what do you feel like this project has taught you  either about your own music or dylanswhen you work with material that is of this quality and is this brilliant it retrains your mind to think about your own writing in a particular way dylan often uses imagery from the bible and merges it with images from our modern world of telephones and televisions and trains and cars as a singer its the range of the material that he writes he writes songs that have an edge of cruelty about them or songs that might be political diatribes and he also writes incredibly tender poignant love songs and he writes songs that have this surreal humor about them there are just so many kinds of songs and as a singer its great to be able to test yourself to see what exactly you can do with all these different types of songs going into the project were there any songs you knew you didnt want to touchthere were some songs like blowin in the wind that i felt like other people had done amazing covers of before i couldnt see a way that i could add to that there were also a couple songs that we tried to do where we couldnt really find unique arrangements we did dont think twice its all right i still enjoy singing that song and we do it live sometimes but i didnt feel like we were able to come up with any way to record it that would justify putting it on the record and saying ok heres a new way into this song so that was really kind of the criteria it was is there something left to say about this song that hasnt already been said and if the answer was yes then we pursued it and if the answer was no and we really thought that a song had been wellserved by other versions then we left it alone did you change any lyrics aroundwe didnt change any lyrics but i did edit a couple of the songs on the song trying to get to heaven we ended up not leaving the last verse in it felt like the energy kind of drained out in the end and i wanted something a little more precise but we did that very carefully we did that very sparingly and most of the time we just kept things as they were obviously if someone has just won the nobel prize in literature because of their lyrics you dont want to go in there and start poking around with

it was a rough time but i eventually was able to come out of it my salvation was doing live shows which are my favorite thing to do she never had another single on the pop charts but one of us opened the door to something more valuable to her than pop stardom it gave her a high enough profile that she started getting invited to do interesting projects and that gave the kind of career she preferred if i hadnt had that hit she says today i dont think i would have been known enough to be welcomed into all these situations like singing with the funk brothers duetting with bob dylan or luciano pavarotti or being asked by stevie wonder to induct gladys knight  the pips into the rock n roll hall of fame to stand next to stevie and sing with someone of that stature was amazing thats not something everyone gets to do in their life she sang with the funk brothers as part of standing in the shadows of motown the documentary about that labels brilliant house band she got to coheadline the 1997 lilith fair tour and to tour with the dead and phil lesh  friends between 2003 and 2006 she got to produce two albums for her earlycareer mentors the gospelsoul masters the holmes brothers and to do three residencies at the cafe carlyle manhattans premier cabaret showcase shes been able to make albums that alternate between original songs and tributes to influences such as bob dylan and classic soul music her newest release is trouble and strife a collection of originals to be able to release an album of new songs 25 years after your last hit single is a luxury that most artists dont get osborne can do it because she has built a different kind of reputation i look to guys like muddy waters or tom waits for what a successful career can be she explains youre not having radio hits or filling stadiums but you can work for decades in clubs and theaters it helps that she owns her own label womanly hips so she can decide what and when to record for this new album she had set the date of the first sessions for september of 2018 but she hadnt decided on the material should she do a sequel to her warmly received 2017 album songs of bob dylan or should she feature her own songwriting this time i procrastinated in deciding till four days before she says but then i told myself im tired of being the tribute queen i felt like id been caught in the role of cover girl for too long i wanted to use my other voice not my singing voice but my creative voice i wanted to give my particular perspective on the world in my particular style like a painter or a poet i like doing other peoples material its all about searching like a detective or librarian looking for the songs that will connect with your voice and personality in a way that will bring something unique to the song even if its not the definitive version but now i wanted to do some writing some storytelling part of her motivation was wanting to respond to the current state of the world which was roiled by climate change gun deaths and official corruptionand this was before covid19 came along she did all the things a normal citizen should dovoting contacting elected officials attending demonstrations donating moneybut she wanted to take advantage of her artistic gifts and highprofile to do more but what can music do a song is not going to change the reality she acknowledges if i write a song about climate change its not going to lower the amount of co2 in the air but it can change the story we tell ourselves about the climate as human beings we tell each other the stories that form our view of the world so its necessary to call out the liars because if you sit back and allow people to abuse their power youre giving them license to do it more music and culture can move society just look at what motown did in the 60s they moved the culture forward by breaking down barriers but it wasnt as if she had a stockpile of songs like that what she had were bits and pieces of songs in the form of melodic fragments on her phone and partial stanzas scribbled down so she locked herself in a room for those four days and combed through all those voicemails and notebook entries to see what was worth keeping its a whole lot of trial and error she explains ill have a lyric idea but i wont know which melody idea might work with it ill find four or five that might work and ill try them out till i find the one that does then i ask myself if this is the chorus what might the verse sound like i put different pieces together to see if they vibrate with one another if the whole becomes larger than the pieces osborne didnt want to write songs that responded to current events only to become irrelevant when the news cycle moved on she wanted to write songs that addressed fundamental dynamics that express themselves in a new way in each succeeding decade hands off for example is an uptempo bluesrock number that finds osborne telling a wouldbe lothario the women dont like you no matter what you do hands off the things that dont belong to you but she never mentions harvey weinstein jeffrey epstein or donald trump by name she leaves it a universal scenario that can be applied to any scoundrel in any era panama an rbnoir meditation full of reverb tribal drums and nels cline guitar considers how bad things have to get before you pack up and leave for another country the meek are in the jailhouse osborne sings the wicked are in charge every time things take a turn for the worse people start asking is it time to go thats countered by whole wide world a more optimistic view of things over the piano triplets and highpitched oohs of classic soul music osborne reassures the pessimists we may be down but we can rise again youve got to know youre not alone when youre talking about these larger concepts she points out youre not attacking a particular person youre saying these underlying tendencies are wrong youre saying people shouldnt be thinking only about their own wealth their own power their own gratification these songs will still be useful 20 to 30 years from now phil ochs wrote some powerful songs but they seemed tied to events at the time and thats why people dont sing his songs as often as they do dylans there was a dylan song man in the long black coat on osbornes breakthrough relish album in 2000 she covered dylans make you feel my love on her righteous love album that same year she duetted with jackson browne on dylans my back pages for the steal this movie soundtrack in 2012 she duetted with dylan himself on the tribute album of the same name and in 2017 she recorded 13 more dylan songs for her own album songs of bob dylan i think i benefitted a lot from doing the bob dylan album she says hes known as a political songwriter but if you look at his songs few are about a specific political event most of them are about mythical characters in mythical situations so they can refer to many different situations i tried to use that i didnt want to talk about any particular figures in these songs i wanted to talk about issues that can be personal as well as political you could have a partner whos abusing power the same way that a leader does in 2016 osborne went to see the new york dolls david johansen at the café carlyle perhaps the premier cabaret showcase in manhattan an intimate room where the likes of bobby short betty buckley george shearing woody allen and ute lemper have had regular residencies so osborne was surprised when a few days later the café invited her to do a residency i thought it was strange osborne confesses because i dont think of myself as a cabaret singer but then i thought it would be an opportunity to try out an idea i had long had to do my version of ella fitzgeralds songbooks where she devoted a whole album to each of the best writers of her time i wanted to do the same thing but with the best writers of my time not the 40s and 50s we considered a lot of writers but dylan kept rising to the top she turned her dylan cabaret show into a tour and then an album she put together a second dylan show for the carlyle and earlier this year she did a tom waits show shed like to do future shows with maybe lou reed paul simon the bee gees or lucinda williams the shows are stripped down osborne on vocals rhythm guitar and hand percussion her personalprofessional partner keith cotton on keyboards and a lead guitarist she wants to pursue her career as one of our best interpretive singers but she also wants to sustain her career as a singersongwriter that she is able to do both is a tribute to the lingering power of her early hit single one of us written by her thenproducer eric bazilian of the hooters it had this catchy melody in the guitar she points out and the lyrics were asking you a question the way a little kid tugs on your sleeve to ask a very basic question like the time my daughter asked me mommy when did time begin people felt like they werent being preached to they were being asked a question and allowed to come up with their own answer it was a way to talk about spirituality without a loaded agenda i got some very nice letters from church groups who were singing it but i also got some death threats and nasty letters saying i was being sacrilegious that song could mean different things to different people and im still trying to write songs like that

was the process like for deciding how to treat each song for deciding how the music would be coloured and styled jo trial and error keith cotton jack petruzzelli and i spent days and days working out different ideas experimenting and refining in preparation for the carlyle shows we were like scientists in a lab it was fun hb this album grew out of short residencies you did at new yorks café carlyle performing dylan songs how have the songs morphed between these initial live performances and the studio versions of the album jo the process of playing the songs night after night allowed us to keep experimenting especially keith and jack once youve got the first few nights under your belt and your brain and hands arent focused on simply remembering the songs and what youd planned in rehearsal you slip into a sort of group mind where youre communicating instinctively and telepathically and some great ideas can emerge if they feel good you remember them for the next night and they become part of the arrangement that you take into the studio hb can audiences expect to be surprised by the shape of the songs on the upcoming tour jo i hope so weve had some great reactions so far in previewing the album for live audiences some songs are greeted with a rush of recognition right away others people dont get until the lyrics start or the chorus comes hb your career has seen you tour widely and as you get ready to tour the new album is there a particular city or venue where you are especially looking forward to performing the songs jo there are loads of great cities im excited to go back to chicago minneapolis nashville pittsburgh all the great west coast towns too many to list were playing in the rocky mountains next week in utah and colorado gorgeous places i hope to get back to europe and australia and japan next year as well tokyo and london and berlin are favourites want to play the paradiso in amsterdam again and bring my mom shes never been hb do you have a special place that just seems to click with you as a performer jo i love playing old churches theres something incredible about the acoustics and the energy maybe all the accumulated prayers are still in the room hb if songs of bob dylan happens to contain your all along the watchtower moment  a version of a song that forever changes and defines the way that song is heard  which track would you like that to be jo well thats for someone else to decide but i do love our version of highway 61 revisited the way we changed the time signature gives it a really propulsive energy different from dylans talking blues style and the genius lyrics come rushing out in a torrent its pretty exciting hb thanks for your time joan joan osbornes brand new album songs of bob dylan will be available

bob dylan album review joan osborne  songs of bob dylan 2 min read tucked away in manhattans upper east side is the café carlyle a venue described by singer joan osborne as intimate it is here back in march 2016 that audiences first caught a glimpse of osbornes ninth studio album songs of bob dylan as she and her creative collaborators  guitarist jack petruzzelli and keyboardist keith cotton  commenced the first of two twoweek residencies at the storied locale performing their interpretations of songs from dylans extensive catalogue as the residencies progressed the trio experimented with the songs arrangements and sounds feeling out what did and didnt work songs of bob dylan opens with a rendition of tangled up in blue which remains very true to the original despite shifting the musical focus from guitar to organ and replacing dylans distinctive delivery with osbornes warm vocals it is well executed but feels rather unimaginative luckily a measured blues interpretation of rainy day women 12  35 promptly follows signalling that osborne and her musical cohorts will be offering up more challenging takes on some of dylans works quinn the eskimo the mighty quinn bears the indelible imprint of the manfred mann version competing with it in terms of catchiness osbornes renderings of dylans songs are at their most compelling when she opts to add some grit and weight to the tracks highway 61 revisited maintains the originals vibe  without resorting to copping riffs from it  while imparting some additional darkness to the composition that is distantly reminiscent of pj harveys punk rendition of the tune and the pushing of high water in a rootsrock direction ensures the listener is instantly engaged augmentation from piano is the main addition to masters of war which otherwise remains an acousticguitar and vocal affair although the utilization of palmmuting and osbornes understated vocal delivery underscores the songs anger while a few of the tracks may arguably adhere too closely to the originals bordering on imitation except for the vocals the quality of songs of bob dylan cannot be faulted it is clear how osborne has earned her reputation as a deft cover
