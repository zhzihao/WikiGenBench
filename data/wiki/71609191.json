Khalid bin Al-Hasfan Al-Farsi (the Persian) confronted them and forced them to flee after he seized a ship from them that was docked on an island off Tyre and captured those on it. It is likely that Al-Hasfan was the governor of Tyre and one of the invaders of its borders, and the commander of the sea was Yazid bin Abi Maryam whom Hisham dismissed for his negligence in confronting the invaders, and the commander of the sea was appointed in his place, Al-Aswad bin Bilal Al-Muharibi, so he cut off the sea in the year 111 AH / 730 AD in response to that invasion.\n\nThe mission of naval defense along the Levantine coast was entrusted to the commander of the sea, which meant Al-Aswad going out to chase the Byzantine invaders during their attack on a merchant ship at the frontier of Beirut. He made an expedition to Cyprus in the year 120 AH / 738 AD and then made an expedition to the island of Crete in the following first or second year.\n\nDuring the reign of Al-Walid bin Yazid, the power of Al-Aswad increased, and he became the commander of the sea army in the entire coast of the Levant. He led a large expedition to the island of Cyprus, landing there in the year 125 AH / 743 AD, and brought a group of its people and settled them between Sidon and Tyre.\n\nDuring the reign of Marwan bin Muhammad, the port of Tyre was restored by the master builder “Ziyad bin Abi Al-Ward Al-Ashja’i,” who left his name engraved in a phrase that was repeated in the port of Sidon, Acre, Maraash, and even Azerbaijan: \"...This is what the Commander of the Faithful Marwan ordered to repair, and it happened on The hand of Ziyad bin Abi Al-Ward.\"\n\nIslamic rule\nDuring the reign of Al-Walid, Jarjūmah, the capital of the Mardaites, rebelled against the rule of the Caliph again, as a result,  Maslama bin Abd al-Malik went to them at the instigation of his brother and entered their capital Jarjumah and dispersed its people in all the Lebanese cities and stipulated a condition for them, and some of them joined his army and participated in the conquests of Muslims without forcing any of them to leave their Christianity.\n\nAbbasid revolution\n\nThe Abbasids seized power from the Umayyads in 750 AD and annexed Lebanon to their rule. At the beginning of this era, the Arslanites settled in Lebanon in 756 AD. The Abbasids imposed harsh taxes on Lebanon, which prompted the Lebanese to stage several uprisings.\n\nAbdullah bin Ali Al-Hashemi pursued the remnants of Marwan bin Muhammad after the battle of Al-Zab, so he went to the city of Qansreen and then Homs, where he stayed for days taking the pledge of allegiance from its people to Abu Al-Abbas. He continued his journey to Baalbek, and the city received him and pledged allegiance to him without resistance. He stayed there for two nights, then traveled and went down from Ain al-Jisr to Anjar and stayed for two days, then went to the Umayyad capital, and entered it in the year 132 AH / 750 AD. Before leaving Baalbek, he arranged its affairs and kept it to Yazid bin Rouh al-Lakhmi because he declared his allegiance to the Abbasids.\n\nBaalbek became affiliated with the Emirate of Abdullah bin Ali, his emirate included Homs, Qansreen, Baalbek, Ghouta, Houran, Golan, and Jordan from the year 132 AH / 750 AD. To the year 136 AH / 754 AD.  Al-Mansūr visited Lebanon in the year 140 AH / 758 AD, and during his visit he settled the Tanukhids in the cities of Lebanon to ward off the Byzantine dangers from its coasts.\n\nMardaite revolts\n\nAfter the fall of the Umayyad state in 132 AH / 750 AD, the Abbasids were unable to win over the people of the Levant to their side, including the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon, because they were deprived of the advantages that they had during the Umayyad era. Moreover, the Abbasids treated the people of the Levant in general as treating the conquered countries during wars, so the Mardaites started a series of revolts, starting in the year 135 AH / 752 AD, and led by one of their leaders “Elias” managed to defeat several armies sent by Caliph al-Mansur to Lebanon, and despite this, Elias was killed in the location known today in the name of “Qob Elias,” however, his companions continued their disobedience under the leadership of another leader named “Samaan,” who defeated the Abbasid armies and almost took over Homs and Hama through the aid that was coming to him by sea from the Byzantines.\n\nThe danger of the Mardaites intensified in the middle of the second century AH when “Bandar” assumed their leadership  and declared himself king over them, so Saleh bin Ali, the uncle of the Caliph, mobilized a large army that he led himself and was able to eliminate their revolt and seized and demolished their fortresses, and in order to eliminate any possible rebellion in the future the Caliph Al-Mansur worked to disperse large numbers of them in the Levant, and he brought in several Arab tribes such as the Tanukhids, a Christian Arab tribe; he placed them in Mardaite areas, and this act was the subject of criticism of the Lebanese-born Imam al-Awza'i, who was sent to the Caliph blaming him for such a procedure.\n\nĀl Arslān\nAs soon as al-Mansur assumed the caliphate in Baghdad, he went to the coastal frontiers, built their forts and cities, and began filling them with armies from the year 136 AH (753/754 AD) until the year 142 AH (759/760 AD). The Abbasids began approaching and allying themselves with the Arab Tanukhids after a meeting between Prince Mundhir bin Malik, nicknamed Al-Tanukhi, and his brother, Prince Arslan, with Caliph Al-Mansur in Damascus.\n\nThe Byzantines took advantage of the political changes resulted by the Abbasid revolution, by attacking the Islamic regions and occupying Tripoli in 141 AH (758/759 AD) from its governor, Rabāh bin al-Nu’mān, with Bekaa getting attacked by the rebel Elias in the year 137 AH (754/755 AD) and the  revolt took place in 141 AH. And when events escalated, it became imperative for the Abbasid Caliph al-Manṣūr to fight back with combat to defend the Caliphate. He mobilized the frontiers with fighters to protect them. He assigned the Tanukhid tribes to head to the mountains of Beirut to protect the coasts of the Levant and Islamic possessions from the Byzantine danger and local hostile movements.\n\nWhen Abu Jaafar Mansur al-Abbasi came to Syria in the year 142 AH / 758 AD, Prince Mundhir and Prince Arslan came from their homeland in Maarrat al-Nu`man with a group of their clan and they met him in As-Sham, and he had heard about their courage in fighting the Byzantines in Antioch and its suburbs, so he welcomed them and assigned them to go with their people to the mountains of Beirut to protect the coasts and frontiers in which he made them leaders of several fiefs. The two princes walked with their clans to Wadi al-Taym, and lodged in the fortress known as the fortress of Abi al-Jaish.\n\nIn the second year [143 AH / 759 AD] they proceeded to the south of Jabal Mughithah, then the clans dispersed in the coastal areas, so Prince Mundhir settled in the fortress of , Prince Arslan in Sin El Fil, Prince Hassan bin Malik in Tardala, Prince Abdullah bin Al-Numan bin Malik in Kafra, and Prince Fawaris bin Abd al-Malik ibn Malik in Aabey, and the Muqaddamun and their clans were dispersed in the country in which there was twelve of them.\n\nAdministrative rulers\nThe 10th-century geographers Ibn al-Faqih and Al Muqadassi and the 13th-century geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi held that besides its capital at Tiberias, Tyre (Sūr in Arabic) was one of Urdunn's chief districts (qura).\n\nGovernors of Al-Urdun during the Umayyad period\nAbu Uthman ibn Marwan ibn al-Hakam (685–705, governed for unspecified period during his brother Caliph Abd al-Malik's rule; identified by Moshe Gil as Aban ibn Marwan, while Asad Q.
