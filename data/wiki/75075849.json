First impacting the Western United States on November 22 and causing eight deaths, the winter storm then traversed across the South, canceling more than 500 flights at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and causing a 40-car pileup on Interstate 40 near Vega, Texas, killing 3 people and injuring 11 others. The storm system then moved across the East Coast of the United States, causing a severe weather outbreak which produced seven tornadoes, including an EF2 tornado which injured two people in North Carolina. Strong winds and heavy snow and rainfall occurred across much of the Northeastern United States, with numerous flood warnings being issued and prompting a snow emergency to be issued in western Maryland. Next impacting Canada, the storm system produced heavy snowfall which caused more than 130 vehicle accidents in which one led to one injury. Overall, the storm system caused fourteen deaths, seventeen injuries, and hundreds of flight cancellations.\n\nMeteorological synopsis \n\nOn November 22 and 23, a 1012 millibar (29.88 inches)-surface low located  southwest of San Diego, California caused impacts across the Western United States. The surface low then moved inland a few hours later, producing freezing rain, sleet, and heavy snowfall and rainfall as the low moved southwest of Phoenix, Arizona. The next day, on November 24, the surface low dissipated along the surface front, though an upper-level vortex produced mixed precipitation ahead of the vortex across areas from Arizona to Texas. The upper-level low-pressure area then moved slowly eastward across the Southwestern United States, producing heavy snowfall and freezing rain across the southern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains, and on November 25, the low-pressure area moved out of the Rocky Mountains and into the Texas panhandle, producing heavy rainfall and freezing rain across east Texas and the lower Mississippi River valley. A low-pressure area then formed several hours later formed in the Gulf of Mexico  of Lake Charles, Louisiana, and as mixed precipitation fell north of the low-pressure area, snow fell as far north as the lower Great Lakes region.\n\nThe low-pressure moved eastward offshore of the Louisiana coast southwest of New Orleans in the early morning hours of November 26, and the pressure deepened to 1004 millibars several hours later while still moving eastward, located just south of Gulf Shores, Alabama at 9:00 AM CST (14:00 UTC). The low-pressure area strengthened and dropped its pressure by one millibar, as it moved eastward to south of Tallahassee, Florida, with a warm front attached to the low moving inland in the Southeastern United States and a cold front moving towards the Florida coastline. Heavy rainfall occurred across the Southeast, along with the low-pressure area that was located northwest of Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nOn November 27, the area of low pressure strengthened and dropped its pressure to 998 millibars, and moved north along the East Coast of the United States to east of Washington, D.C., as a second area of low pressure with the same strength developed in central South Carolina. Heavy rainfall continued across the Southeast, and snow fell from the Ohio Valley to the interior Northeastern United States. Rain spread into the Mid-Atlantic region several hours later, and the organized area of heavy rains moved off the Southeast, mixing with sleet and snow as heavy snowfall occurred across much of the Northeast. The snow then tapered off in the late hours of November 27 as the low-pressure area moved into southeastern Canada and strengthened, dropping its pressure to 984 millibars. As a result, heavy snow fell in southeastern Canada on November 27 and 28, and also causing snow squalls.\n\nImpact\n\nWestern United States \n\nThe winter storm first impacted the Western United States on November 22, bringing strong winds and heavy snow and rainfall. Strong wind gusts led to more than 50,000 power outages in California. One downed power line started a wildfire, which grew more than , leading to evacuations.\n\nIn anticipation of heavy snowfall and icy conditions, several roads in the Angeles National Forest were closed. South of Ely, Nevada, U.S. Route 93 was closed, and hundreds of car accidents occurred across Arizona and New Mexico. Interstate 10 in New Mexico and western Texas was covered in ice and snow. Flagstaff, Arizona recorded 11 inches of snow, and near the Four Corners as much as  of snow fell. Heavy snow fell on Abajo Peak, Utah, where it received . Between 50 and 60 vehicles were stranded due to heavy snowfall across higher elevations in eastern Lincoln County, Nevada.\n\nPhoenix, Arizona received  of rain on November 23, which became the second-wettest November day there on record. Flooding also closed several miles of Arizona State Route 303 across western portions of Phoenix, as a flood watch was in effect for the entire Phoenix metropolitan area. Heavy rainfall also forced several Arizona Interscholastic Association school playoff games to be postponed. Thunderstorms produced lightning, hail, and heavy rainfall across Antelope Valley in southern California, with the latter impact leading to flooding across roads. The impacts from the winter storm led to eight deaths.\n\nSouthern United States\n\nTexas \n\nOn November 24, 2013, more than 300 flights were canceled at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, and an additional 200 were canceled the next day. McDonald Observatory was closed, and a winter storm warning was issued for portions of the state. Several multi-car pileups occurred on Interstate 40 near Vega, which killed three people and injured 11 others.

The bridge itself where the bus crashed sustained minor damage. Marfa Public Radio suffered a brief outage, and 44,000 power outages occurred across Dallas.\n\nElsewhere \nIn Oklahoma, more than  of snow fell across portions of the state as winter storm warnings and advisories were in effect. At Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City, 10 percent of flights on November 24 were canceled. In Ashland, Oklahoma,  of sleet fell, and four fatal car accidents occurred in the state.\n\nFlight delays were reported at airports in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nNortheastern United States \nWind gusts over  occurred on Long Island, New York, and John F. Kennedy International Airport recorded a  wind gust. A snow emergency was issued in western Maryland, and power outages occurred across western New York as a result of the heavy snowfall. Corry, Pennsylvania received  of snow.\n\nA flood watch was in effect for portions of the Northeast as the southern side of the winter storm produced heavy rainfall. A flash flood warning was issued for southeastern New York and southwestern Connecticut, which included Peekskill, New York, Bridgeport, Connecticut, and New Haven, Connecticut. Widespread flood warnings and advisories were issued for portions of the Northeast, including western parts of the New York metropolitan area. The flooding caused a vehicle accident on the westbound lanes of Schuylkill Expressway (I-76) in Pennsylvania, which killed one person. The eastbound lanes of the expressway were also closed due to flooding. More than 1,000 power outages occurred in Connecticut, including one power transformer which blew, causing power outages, and started a small fire. Several underpasses were flooded across the state. Temperatures reached  in Saranac Lake, New York, and wind chills reached  in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nAirport disruptions occurred during the winter storm, with 628 flights being canceled and nearly 6,000 flights being delayed up to two hours across several airports across the eastern United States, including airports in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and LaGuardia Airport in New York City.\n\nSoutheastern United States \n\nOn November 26, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a level 2/slight risk of severe weather across the region, from Florida to North Carolina. Several tornadoes touched down across the region, with portions of Morehead City and Atlantic Beach, North Carolina sustaining damage from an EF2 tornado. The tornado injured two people, displaced 15 people, and 6,000 power outages occurred in Carteret County, North Carolina. A waterspout made landfall on Ocracoke Island, North Carolina, breaking two power poles, causing power outages. Five additional tornadoes touched down in Florida, including an EF1 tornado and one EF0 tornado, and altogether caused $252,000 in damage. Wind damage also occurred across the Southeast, with numerous uprooted trees and power lines down. Heavy rainfall also materialized across the Southeast, with the heaviest rain falling at Shelby–Cleveland County Regional Airport, receiving .\n\nAtlanta had less than an inch of snow, receiving , but it was the third November snow since 1930.\n\nCanada \n\nIn preparation of the winter storm, schools across Montreal were closed. The winter storm impacted eastern portions of the country, primarily Quebec and Ontario, with Ottawa receiving nearly  of snow and Toronto recording more than  of snowfall. More than 130 vehicle accidents occurred on snow-covered roads, including one injury crash. Several vehicles slid off Ontario Highway 402, and heavy, sufficient snowfall led to Boler Mountain being opened early. Snow squall warnings were also issued for portions of southeast Canada. An early estimate of $550,000 was given after the winter storm in London, Ontario, and 125 vehicle snowplows were deployed.\n\nReferences \n\n2013–14 North American winter\n2013 natural

dallasfort worth international airport spokeswoman cynthia vega said most of the cancelled flights were in the afternoon and evening hours and were with american airlines and american eagle the possibility of ice on the runways led to a series of conference calls and meetings early sunday she added noting the airport had liquid and solid deicers ready for usethe storm system though was particularly hard to predict because a couple of degrees here or there with the temperature will determine whether regions see rain sleet or snow bradshaw saidits very difficult to pin those down
