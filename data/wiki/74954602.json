{"id": 74954602, "key": "Directive on Administrative Co-operation in the field of Taxation (2011/16)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive%20on%20Administrative%20Co-operation%20in%20the%20field%20of%20Taxation%20%282011/16%29", "text": "The Directive on Administrative Co-operation in the field of taxation (commonly referred to as 'the DAC') is a Directive (European Union) which sets rules for the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) which apply to members of the European Union (EU).\n\nThe DAC's primary purpose is to tackle tax evasion and avoidance through the sharing of information on individuals and entities within the EU.\n\nOverview \nThe Directive has been amended 7 times to expand the scope of AEOI within the EU, reflecting both global initiatives in this area undertaken by the OECD as well as the EU's own initiatives. In addition, an amendment to the Regulation on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax adds an additional AEOI reporting requirement in respect of payments.\n\nHistory \nThe original Directive (Council Directive 2011/16) entered into force in 2011 and established a framework for co-operation between Member states of the European Union in direct tax matters. The Directive excludes from its scope value-added tax matters, although a separate regulation (Council Regulation No. 904/2010) establishes similar principles\n\nThe first Directive established 2 key principles:\n\n Spontaneous Exchange of Information - for tax authorities to inform each other where there may be loss of tax, tax avoidance or profit shifting\n Automatic Exchange of Information - for information in the possession of tax authorities related to residents on another EU Member State, such as employment income, director's income or pensions.\n\nCommon Reporting Standard / DAC2 \nIn 2014, the OECD agreed the principles of Automatic Exchange of Information for financial accounts, under the Common Reporting Standard.\n\nIn order to implement these rules with the EU, the DAC was amended by Directive 2014/107 to include the exchange of information on financial accounts. This change required banks, asset managers and certain insurance companies in the EU to gather information on the tax residence of customers and to provide reports to their domestic tax authority every year for onward exchange with other EU Member States.\n\nAs a result, an EU resident who holds a bank account, investment account or other investment in another EU country will have details of that account reported to their domestic tax authority. A report by the European Parliament on the implementation of DAC2 indicated that more than 8 million accounts held by EU residents in other countries were reported in 2018.\n\nA 2019 report into the effectiveness of the Common Reporting Standard noted that it was \"substantially dif�ferent from any initiative in the field of information exchange launched so far, including its role model FATCA\".\n\nExchange of Information on Tax Rulings / DAC3 \nIn 2015, the Directive was amended to add the exchange of information on tax rulings, which requires tax authorities to exchange information where they grant a tax ruling to a resident of another EU Member State. This gave effect to Action 5 of the OECD's Base erosion and profit shifting initiative (BEPS) which required the same exchange of information between all BEPS adopters.\n\nThis amendment is the only rule under the DAC which does not impose any obligations on companies to provide additional information to their tax authority.\n\nCountry-by-country reporting / DAC4 \nIn 2016, the Directive was amended to add the exchange of Country-by-Country Reporting by companies operating in the EU. This gave effect to Action 13 of the OECD's BEPS initiative in the EU.\n\nAll multinational companies with revenues greater than €750 million are required to submit reports annually to their tax authority, including groups which are parented outside of the EU but operate in the EU. \n\nIn 2021, the EU agreed Directive 2021/2101 which requires public country-by-country reporting to be published by the same companies from 2026 and available on the company's website or on a central register. The requirement under DAC4 remains in place, as more information is required under DAC4 than under the public disclosure rules.\n\nExchange of beneficial ownership information / DAC5 \nThe Directive was amended again in 2016 to provide access to beneficial ownership registers which were established under Anti Money Laundering Directives. In particular, Council Directive 2015/849, the EU's 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive created a requirement for the registration of information on beneficial ownership in a central register.\n\nMandatory Disclosure Rules / DAC6 \nThe Directive was amended in 2018 to include exchange of information on 'cross-border arrangements', which are transactions which meet one or more hallmarks of Tax avoidance and which involve residents of EU Member States, or otherwise concern member states.\n\nThe Directive defines 15 hallmarks of potential tax avoidance which include secrecy requirements, conversion of income to capital, double deductions for expenses, and cross-border movements of assets or business.\n\nThose rules also gave effect to the OECD's Model Mandatory Disclosure Rules for CRS Avoidance Arrangements and Opaque Offshore Structures which require reporting on transactions which seek to avoid reporting under DAC2.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU Council subsequently amended the Directive to allow 6-months of additional time for implementation.\n\nDigital Platforms Information reporting / DAC7 \nIn 2020, the Directive was amended to include rules which require digital platforms to report information on sellers who use the platform to:\n\n Rent property\n Rent transportation\n Sell goods\n Provide personal services\n\nThe rules mirror the OECD's Digital Platforms Information package and implement the rules in the EU.\n\nDAC7 has two notable differences from previous amendments to the Directive:\n\n It is extraterritorial in scope, requiring all digital platforms globally to report on sellers resident in the EU. For example, an EU resident individual selling on a platform based in the US would be reportable under these rules.\n It requires reporting on both domestic and cross-border sellers. For example, a platform resident in France must also report on French sellers. Previous Directives have been restricted to cross-border reporting in line with the EU's remit to act in furtherance of the European single market.\n\nCrypto-Assets Reporting Framework / DAC8 \nIn 2023, the EU agreed an amendment to the Directive to implement the OECD's Crypto-Assets Reporting Framework for all member states. That adoption was closely tied to the EU's adoption of Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, with the two regimes intended to work together. These rules require Crypto-Asset Service Providers to report on all transactions which involve the acquisition, disposal or exchange of cryptocurrency and other digital assets. \n\nLike DAC7, the scope of DAC8 is extraterritorial - for example, requiring cryptocurrency exchanges based in the US to report on EU resident customers.\n\nDAC8 also includes amendments to the scope of the original DAC and to DAC2, to mirror the OECD's amendments to the Common Reporting Standard.\n\nThe rules are due to go into effect from 1 January 2026.\n\nCentral Electronic System of Payments (CESOP) \nIn addition to the amendments to the DAC, an additional AEOI reporting requirement was added in 2020 in respect of VAT. This was added through amendments to the VAT Directive and the Regulation on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax as the DAC only applies to direct tax matters.\n\nThose amendments create a reporting obligation known as CESOP, which requires Payment Service Providers in the EU to report on payments made by EU residents.\n\nMechanism for information gathering and exchange \nWith the exception of the original DAC and DAC3, all other amendments to the Directive require information to be provided by private companies to their domestic tax authorities, who then exchange information with EU Member States through the Common Communication Network. In the case of DAC2, DAC3, DAC4, DAC7 and DAC8, EU Member States will also exchange the information collected with non-EU countries operating under the rules established by the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for tax purposes. This also applies to a sub-set of information exchanged under DAC6.\n\nAs a result of the DAC, a wide range of companies are required to establish procedures to identify EU residents and report information on their activities to their domestic tax authority. These companies are commonly referred to as 'intermediaries' in the text of the DACs.\n\nIntermediaries with obligations under the DAC\n\nImpact on individuals resident in the EU \nIndividuals resident in the EU are likely to be asked to provide certain information by intermediaries who are within the scope of the DAC. Typically an EU resident opening a bank account, investment account or establishing themselves as a seller on a digital platform should be asked to provide details of their tax residency and their Tax Identification Number. From 2026, this will also apply to EU citizens establishing relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges and other digital assets providers. \n\nIndividuals may be asked to provide additional information where they provide more complex information - for example, a tax residency in one country but an address in another country. The precise rules to be followed vary for each of the DACs.\n\nThere have been legal challenges raised in relation to the scope of the DAC and the perceived risk to data security. For example, an Italian individual challenged the exchange of information by the UK's tax authority HM Revenue and Customs under the Common Reporting Standard/DAC2. In 2022, the European Court of Justiceconcluded that the rules under DAC6 which required law firms to report on client activities would breach Legal professional privilege requirements.\n\nFurther reading \nEuropean Commission - Evaluation of Administrative Cooperation in Direct Taxation FINAL REPORT, 24 April 2019\n\nEuropean Court of Auditors - Exchanging tax information in the EU: solid foundation, cracks in the implementation, March 2021\n\nReferences \n\nEuropean Union directives\nTaxation in the European Union\n2011 in law", "unikey": "Directive on Administrative Co-operation in the field of Taxation (2011/16)", "summary": "The Directive on Administrative Co-operation in the field of taxation (commonly referred to as 'the DAC') is a Directive (European Union) which sets rules for the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) which apply to members of the European Union (EU).\n", "outlines": ["Overview", "History", "Mechanism_for_information_gathering_and_exchange", "Further_reading", "References"], "contents": ["The Directive has been amended 7 times to expand the scope of AEOI within the EU, reflecting both global initiatives in this area undertaken by theOECDas well as the EU's own initiatives.

cooperation and controlgeneral overviewenhanced administrative cooperation in the field of direct taxationadministrative cooperation in direct taxation in the eu one of the benefits of the internal market is that eu citizens and businesses have the freedom to move operate and invest across national borders but since direct taxation is not harmonised across the eu this freedom can mean that some taxpayers manage to avoid or evade tax in their country of residence which usually according to the bilateral tax treaties has the right to impose tax on worldwide income and assets even if the income or asset is taxed in the other country naturally no double taxation should exist either and there are agreements in place to avoid this but the correct amount of taxes must be paid in each relevant countrytax authorities in the eu have therefore agreed to cooperate more closely so as to be able to apply their taxes correctly to their taxpayers and combat tax fraud and tax evasion administrative cooperation in direct taxation between the competent authorities of the eu member states helps to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share of the tax burden irrespective of where they work

because of the covid19 pandemic08052020 the commission has decided to propose deferring certain deadlines for filing and exchanging information under the directive on administrative cooperation dac member states will have three additional months to exchange information on financial accounts of which the beneficiaries are tax residents in another member state as well as on certain crossborder tax planning arrangements similarly intermediaries or taxpayers liable to report information on certain crossborder tax planning arrangements will have three additional months to do so depending on the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic the commission proposes the possibility to extend the deferral period once for a maximum of three further months the proposed measures only affect the deadlines for reporting and exchanging information under the dac the reportable arrangements made during the postponement period will have to be reported by the time the deferral has terminated equally the exchange of information between member states on financial accounts and on reportable crossborder tax planning arrangements will resume by the time the deferral has ended link to the proposal16092019

duties excise duties and compulsory social contributions because these are already covered by other union legislation on administrative cooperation also recovery of tax debts is regulated via its own legislationthe scope of persons covered by particular exchanges of information depends on the subject matter the directive covers natural persons ie individuals legal persons ie companies and any other legal arrangements like trusts and foundations that are resident in one or more of the eu member statesexchange of information the directive provides for the exchange of specified information in three forms spontaneous automatic and on requestspontaneous exchange of information takes place if a country discovers information on possible tax evasion relevant to another country which is either the country of the income source or the country of residenceexchange of information on request is used when additional information for tax purposes is needed from another countryautomatic exchange of information is activated in a crossborder situation where a taxpayer is active in another country than the country of residence in such cases tax administrations provide automatically tax information to the residence country of the taxpayer in electronic form on a periodic basis the directive provides for mandatory exchange of five categories of income and assets employment income pension income directors fees income and ownership of immovable property and life insurance products the scope has later been extended to financial account information crossborder tax rulings and advance pricing arrangements country by country reporting and tax planning schemes these amendments which extend the application of the original directive are loosely based on the common global standards agreed by tax administrations at international level notably at the oecd however they sometimes go further and importantly they are legislative rather than being based on political agreement without legislative force the directive provides for a practical framework to exchange information  ie standard forms for exchanging information on request and spontaneously as well as computerised formats for the automatic exchange of information  secured electronic channels for the exchange of information and a central directory for storing and sharing information on crossborder tax rulings advance pricing arrangements and reportable crossborder arrangements  tax planning schemes member states are also required to provide a feedback to each other on the use of information received and to examine together with the commission how well the directive supports the administrative cooperationother forms of administrative cooperation the directive provides for other means of administrative cooperation such as the presence of officials of a member state in the offices of the tax authorities of another member state or during administrative enquiries carried out therein it also covers simultaneous controls allowing two or more member states to conduct simultaneous controls of persons of common or complementary interest requests for notifying tax instruments and decisions issued by

bank accounts and trusts on an automatic basis from september 2017 it promises to prise open the secretive affairs of those who are evading tax and to play a part in reducing the socalled tax gaps of governments struggling with stubbornly high fiscal deficits the initiative is symbolic of a broader move towards more disclosure of information with a greater onus on individuals and their advisers to comply and steeper penalties for those who do not damian bloom a private client partner who specialises in international tax and estate planning at berwin leighton paisner the law firm says changes are unavoidable for wealthy families clients have moved on from throwing their hands up in horror to accepting that all of their affairs will soon become available to at least one tax authority and that they need to plan on this basis he says bloom says families are worried about having to explain some of their arrangements to authorities for the first time there are many justifiable reasons for having an offshore bank account not least privacy but in the current climate there is an assumption that those with offshore accounts must be dodgy sophie dworetzsky a partner at withers the global law firm says the common perception that wealthy people with offshore accounts and trusts must have something to hide is misplaced it is often due to perceived threats of extortion and kidnap in many countries the eus proposals to require tax advisers to report the beneficial ownership of trusts with the creation of a publicly accessible register of the details would undermine the anonymity that trusts currently afford if information like this is open to the public it is open to abuse says edward stone a partner at berkeley law dworetzsky says many families are justifiably concerned that details of their wealth could prompt targeted attacks particularly in their home countries they are reevaluating their arrangements in the eu because of the plans for a beneficialownership register other large tax jurisdictions such as the uk have become less attractive for wealthy nonresidents recently as politicians have tightened tax regimes individuals used to be happy to talk about their nondom status at the dinner table but now it is whispered in the corridordamian bloomdworetzsky points to the uk governments pledge this july to abolish the permanent nondomiciled status that allows overseas income to be exempted from uk tax the announcement that anyone living in the country for more than 15 years out of 20 will become a tax resident followed other changes including increases to property taxes that target wealthy foreign families when you put everything together people are starting to feel a little hounded she says it is this rising cost of compliance combined with new regulations that is prompting action now dworetzsky continues there are frustrations that costs are being incurred to disclose different information to different jurisdictions    it leaves people wanting to simplify their structures bloom says that his firms clients are looking to consolidate their affairs in one jurisdiction often from myriad countries to avoid costly duplication of administration and reporting moving assets to lowtax jurisdictions outside the common reporting standard has not been on the agenda he adds especially because financial institutions are increasingly unwilling to risk facilitating tax evasion hsbc europes largest bank came under scrutiny earlier this year after detailed allegations that its swiss private bank helped clients to avoid tax in march it launched a review of the jersey accounts of its ukresident clients at a time when banks are particularly fearful of breaching compliance rules bloom says there is growing tension between banks

requires financial institutions to pass on details of overseas assets held by us citizens prompted some wealth managers to shun their custom wealthy individuals are of course not immune to reputational concerns and although it may be possible to circumvent international information sharing very few appear to be adopting aggressive strategies says berkeley laws stone there are lowtax jurisdictions where people could go such as panama and dubai than they have to but their main goal is wealth preservation while remaining compliant tax is not the number one priority individuals used to be happy to talk about their nondom status at the dinner table but now it is whispered in the corridor says bloom it is now not socially acceptable at all to say i am moving all of my assets to panama stricter penalties are also a factor tax evasion is a criminal offence in most countries but intent must usually be proved the uk government has proposed introducing a strict liability offence meaning individuals can be prosecuted automatically for tax evasion regardless of whether they necessarily intended to break the law dermot callinan uk head of private client advisory at kpmg the professional services group says that opportunities such as the liechtenstein disclosure facility for accidental tax evaders who may have inherited undeclared offshore assets to become compliant with tax authorities are running out people are effectively being told they must now be compliant having had years to settle any issues on beneficial terms he says once tax authorities have information from the crs it will be a very different environment where people need to understand that carelessness can lead to severe penalties letter in response to this article oecd information exchange puts

p9_ta20210392 explanatory statement  summary of facts and findings motion for a european parliament resolution minority position information on adoption in committee responsible final vote by roll call in committee responsible explanatory statement  summary of facts and findings in line with its responsibilities under article 14 tfeu the european parliament has endeavoured to assess the enforcement and implementation of the directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation 201116eu and its first three revisions dac2  4 unfortunately the european parliament has been prevented from fulfilling its functions of political control under article 14 tfeu which are also reflected in paragraphs 2024 of the 2016 interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking iia despite the express agreement of the three institutions in paragraph 41 of the iia on the importance of a more structured cooperation among them to assess the application and effectiveness of union law with a view to its improvement through legislation the european parliament has not been granted access to the documents and data necessary to properly assess the implementation of union law on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation within the framework of this implementation report the econ chair addressed a letter to the european commission requesting access to documents on the implementation of the dac this request was ultimately rejected on 19 november 2020 on the ground that a large majority of member states had objected to the commission forwarding these documents to parliament according to annex ii paragraph 21 of the 2010 interinstitutional agreement on the framework agreement on relations between the european parliament and the european commission confidential information from a member state can only be forwarded to parliament with its consent except for the notable exceptions of sweden and finland the member states did not consent to granting access to the documents necessary for the european impact assessment eia carried out ahead of this draft implementation report the councils legal reasoning behind this refusal was that the parliaments request amounted to an improper encroachment upon a competence that the treaties clearly confer upon the commission this reasoning must be contested when asking the commission to be provided with access to member states information within the framework of an implementation report parliament is exercising its function of political control over the commission for which it might prove necessary to examine member states documents in this connection the principle of sincere cooperation between the union and member states enshrined in article 4 teu should be read as requiring from member states to grant access to parliament to their documents on the transposition and enforcement of eu legislation in possession of the commission a general refusal of documents originating from member states with the reference to an iia cannot put the european parliament in a weaker position than ordinary citizens under regulation 10492001 as the european parliament was not provided with the information necessary to exercise its function of political control this implementation report is severely limited in its scope a study prepared by economici associati in the context of the commissions evaluation of dac in 2019 was a main source of data on the implementation of the directive however as this study only covers the period from 2015 to 2017 the european parliament is unable to evaluate more recent developments for the reasons outlined above the eia had to rely to a large extent on publicly available information such as the relevant documents published by the european commission interviews with tax administrations and european commission officials a stakeholder survey and information on the implementation of dac provided by national parliaments publicly available data on the volumes of exchanges of information automatic and other and the value covered by such exchanges is very limited especially regarding bilateral flows of information between member states based on the limited available data the economisti associati study found that the volume of exchanges under dac13 has increased markedly since the provisions entered into application however no quantitative information is available on the exchange of information concerning countrybycountry reports under dac4 only one national parliament germany provided information on the existence of data on countrybycountry reports for the years 20162018 in response of a survey carried out in the context of the eia further information on the implementation of dac at member state level was provided by the national parliaments of austria belgium finland germany luxembourg and portugal to complement the data of the economisti associati study the publicly available data on exchanges of information at member state level under the dac remains scarce and patchy overall the information available on the implementation of dac14 is very limited the rapporteur apologises for his inability to deliver a fullyfledged implementation report the european parliament should be prepared to use all legal means at its disposal in order to receive access to all information necessary to assess the implementation of this important directive once the european parliament is able to fulfil its control functions through access to documents it should start working on an encompassing implementation report on the dac the lack of data on the effectiveness of dac14 as well as a lack of statistics on compliance costs and administrative burdens which may be alleviated are a source of serious concern beyond the most unfortunate implications for sincere interinstitutional cooperation the quality of eu legislation suffers if it is not possible to conduct a meaningful audit of its costs and added value as well as its coherence with other rules and regulations scope of this implementation report to the extent that this was possible this report assesses the implementation of the obligations of information exchange under dac1 and its subsequent amendments which aim to combat tax fraud tax avoidance and tax evasion by facilitating the exchange of information related to taxation the focus is on the initial directive dac1 and the first three amendments dac24 as later amendments have only recently entered into application dac56 or had not yet been adopted when the present report was prepared dac78 dac was introduced to lay down the rules and procedures for cooperation between member states on the exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant to the tax administration of the member states as the parliament highlighted in its report on the proposal for a dac7 the term foreseeable relevance is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent the general objective of the dac is to protect the financial interests of the member states and the eu while ensuring the proper functioning of the single market the initial directive dac1 lays down the rules and procedures for cooperation between member states on the exchange of relevant information between tax administrations of the member states the development and the extension of scope of dac can be summarised as follows dac1 automatic exchange of information aeoi of five specific categories of income and capital income from employment directors fees pensions life insurance products and immovable property entry into force in 2013 aeoi provisions effective as of january 2015 dac2 aeoi on financial accounts and related income including information on account balance or value amounts of dividends and interests other financial income and capital gains entry into force in 2016 dac3 aeoi on advance tax rulings atr and advance price arrangements apa with information uploaded on a central platform maintained by the commission entry into force in january 2017 dac4 aeoi of countrybycountry reports cbcr which multinational enterprises mne in the eu are required to file when their total consolidated revenue is equal or higher than 750 million entry into force in june 2017 dac5 access by tax authorities to beneficial ownership information as collected under antimoney laundering rules aml entry into force in january 2018 dac6 aeoi on tax planning crossborder arrangements and mandatory disclosure rules for intermediaries entry into force since july 2020 findings since 2011 the dac has been continuously improved to widen the scope of the eoi in order to curb tax fraud tax evasion and tax avoidance however some types of income and assets are still excluded from the scope which presents a risk of circumventing tax obligations in cross border situations in order to further improve the dac the following items of income or nonfinancial assets should be included under the dac framework capital gains related to immovable property and capital gains related to financial assets noncustodial dividend income nonfinancial assets such as cash art gold or other valuables held at free ports custom warehouses or safe deposit boxes and ownership of yachts and private jets in addition member states should be required to exchange information on all categories of income under dac1 so as to increase the effectiveness of dac1 furthermore the provisions of dac2 with regard to reporting financial institutions and types of accounts should be reviewed and if necessary expanded in order to close loopholes with regard to dac3 it must be ensured that the necessary stricter rules concerning the exchange of tax rulings are designed in such a way as to prevent adverse effects such as an increase in informal arrangements which then again go unreported it is regrettable that earlier calls by the european parliament to improve the dac framework along these lines have been ignored so far too often the information exchanged is of limited quality and little monitoring of the systems effectiveness takes place the 2019 commission evaluation highlighted that member states often do not go beyond the minimum requirements of the dac in exchanging information there is currently no common eu framework for monitoring the systems performance and achievements and only few member states systematically carry out quality checks on the data exchanged under dac1 and dac2 this fact significantly increases the risk that reported data is incomplete or inaccurate particularly considering that only a few member states have and apply procedures to audit information submitted by financial institutions under dac2 this report therefore calls on the commission to issue further guidelines to help member states analyse the information received and to use it effectively moreover the commission and the member states should establish a common framework for measuring the impact and the costbenefits of dac as well as making the dac exchanges fully auditable this effort should be complemented with the annual publication of a summary of the information received by member states by the commission it must be noted that the effectiveness of the dac relies heavily on aml rules in place at member state level therefore the insufficient transposition and implementation of amld4 and 5 across a very significant number of member states is highly worrying as are loopholes of the regime it is also alarming that no member state attained a high level of effectiveness rating during the most recent assessment carried out by fatf without strong due diligence obligations and consistent reporting of beneficial ownership information mandated by aml rules the effectiveness of the dac will remain severely limited lastly in the international context the peer review carried out under the auspices of the oecd global forum on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes global forum continues to reveal worrying shortcomings regarding both the common reporting standard crs as well as information exchanged on request eoir according to the review carried out by the global forum 10 member states are not fully compliant with the crs with regard to the eoir standard the peer review identified material deficiencies in 18 member states and deemed malta to be only partially compliant with the standard in order to effectively curb tax fraud tax evasion and tax avoidance both internationally and within european borders the eu must lead by example while new legislation to strengthen and further improve the dac is very welcome and needed a strong focus must be on ensuring the thorough implementation of existing rules and standards also in the field of aml minority position pursuant to rule 554 of the rules of procedure gunnar beck the report addresses some important shortcomings in the scope and functioning of dac and suggests a number of good proposals that may improve the dac framework however we regret that the rapporteur and the other political groups dont adequately address some important shortcomings regarding reporting requirements for nonfinancial entities nfes such as trusts foundations and nonprofit organisations these organisations are exempt from numerous dac and aml requirements usually because of the lack of a beneficial owner according to fatf the european court of auditors and a number of national supervisors this makes nfes useful tools for money laundering terrorist financing and tax evasion purposes we take note that the other political groups dont want to close these important tax and transparency loopholes for such organisations information on adoption in committee responsible date adopted 2752021 result of final vote 46

sellers information for accuracy report to tax authorities annually by 31 january revalidate seller information periodically and after a change of circumstances provide the information to sellers to help them complete tax returns use the information to ensure sellers are complying with their tax obligations enforce the rules and ensure that platforms are operating them correctly in addition the platform must send electronically totheir users and to the tax authorities by 31january at the latest a summary of the transactions carried out in the prior year the french government has not yet indicated whether its legislation will be adapted to alleviate the reporting obligations that will fall on platforms as a result of dac7 however the legislation will have to be enhanced where it currently falls short of the dac7 requirements eg thresholds oecd model rules for platform operators the oecd has published both model rules for reporting by platform operators and an international exchange framework in the form of a multilateral competent authority agreement to be signed by adopting jurisdictions the oecd rules and the eus dac7 are designed to jigsaw together to avoid double reporting by digital platforms platforms in jurisdictions adopting the oecd rules can be exempted from the requirement to report for aeoi purposes but not vat in the eu and viceversa the oecd framework contains a series ofoptions that adopting jurisdictions may consider  including the extension of rules tothesale of goods the inclusion of bank accountinformation and other data elements ajurisdiction adopting all the oecds options iseffectively adopting dac7 and should find thatthe regimes are fully compatible at least intheory if not in practice further meetings of the oecd are expected todefine the list of adopting countries and the timeline for adoption like the eu the oecd is expected to publish rules in early 2022 bringing into scope cryptocurrency and potentially emoney and it is likely that further updates onthe adoption of these rules could be released atthe same time the oecd has also developed the guidelines the role of digital platforms in the collection of vatgst on online sales the guidelines propose a number of options whereby the role of platforms in the collection ofvatgst could extend from education and enhanced reporting requirements through to making platforms liable for the total amount of vatgst due on the underlying transactions the uk consultation the uk is the first country to publicly consult ondomestic implementation of the aeoi rules see reporting rules for digital platforms the approach that has been adopted by hm treasury seeks to bridge the gap between the eu rules and the oecd framework notably by taking advantage of the optionality presented in the oecd framework and including the sale of goods and various data elements required by dac7 although it is unlikely the uk will deviate significantly from the oecd model rules hmrcsexchange of information policy team hasconsulted widely with industry and has published substantial guidance for previous aeoiregimes the team has taken an active role in discussions about the adoption of the rules clarifications of uncertain items during implementation discussions on xml schemas and methods of exchange and in discussions ontax authority review of compliance many countries globally have looked to uk guidance onaeoi when framing their own rules the consultation acknowledges that the timingof the provision of revenue data does not fit with the uksincome tax self assessment deadline therefore the primary use of these saleslevel data is likely to belimited to identifying the existence of income sources ratherthan prepopulation oftaxreturns what can platforms be doing now the implementation of these rules will create operational readiness challenges notably around the collection of information from 1 january 2023 and reporting in january 2024 for aeoi and immediately for transactions within the scope of the eus new vat rules typically implementation programmes on this scale can take 1218 months to deliver from finalisation of the domestic rules to the golive of technology changes there is aneed for tax authorities to quickly finalise theaeoi rules so that businesses can start onimplementation there is also a range of nontax issues to beaddressed from data quality to customer communications and inevitably data protection and legal issues the adoption of previous aeoi regimes notably crs dac2 and mandatory disclosure rules dac6 have had fractured implementations with different rules in each jurisdiction and different reporting requirements causing a significant extra compliance burden for organisations digital platforms will want early engagement with tax authorities in order to drive a consistent and coordinated approach moving to vat while the eu vat directive setsout details of the data to be made available andeffectively retained for 11 years there is no indication as to the format to be used nor the means of transmission should data be requested itis anticipated that the vat in the digital age project will provide a clearer framework within which this data must be provided and arrangements put into place such that the data provided to one member state can be deemed to besupplied to all 27 a onestop shop perhaps conclusion the expansion of the dac and oecd rules to apply to digital platforms represents a substantial enlargement of aeoi tax authorities will undoubtedly view new data together with vat information as powerful tools with which to tackle the tax gap for the digital platforms affected there is a substantial compliance exercise now for vat purposes and further in 2022 for aeoi businesses need to be aware of the consequences of noncompliance in terms of penalties and delisting of noncooperative users even those not affected by these rules should not sit too comfortably dac9 covering the mutual communication of among others the revenues of high net worth individuals has been mooted and the eus vat in the digital age projectwill potentially extend the realtime reporting and einvoicing obligations falling on relevant businesses wherever they are located aeoi imposes a substantial burden on industryturning digital platforms from business enablers into tax authorities delegated enforcers there is a need for governments to demonstrate that bulk data collection is capable of delivering meaningful results  both the european court of auditors and the european parliament have said asmuch for the existing dacs but for now tax authorities are no longer scared of large volumes of information and as confidence with analytics and machine learning grows it will

under eu law global  publication  february 2023 on 8 december 2022 the european court of justice ecj issued a judgment in case c69420 orde van vlaamse balies andothers v vlaamse regering that provides a significant clarification of the scope of legal professional privilege under eu law the ecj confirmed that the obligation for lawyerintermediaries advising on potentially aggressive crossborder tax arrangements to notify other nonclient intermediaries of their reporting obligations visàvis the tax authorities infringes the right to respect for communication between a lawyer and their client with this judgment the ecj definitively confirms that eu legal professional privilege protectsthe confidentiality of lawyerclient communications not only in relation to the exercise of the clients rights of defense but legal advice beyond the litigation context background ecj judgment implications  including for competition law matters background ecj judgment in its preliminary ruling the grand chamber2of the ecj responded positively to the question with regard to the infringement of article 7 of the charter but not article 47 clarifying that the protection of legal professional privilege is not limited to activities relating to the defense of a client in legal proceedings but extends to the relationship between a lawyer and their client outside of a judicial context as a preliminary remark the ecj recalled that article 7 of the charter protects the confidentiality of all correspondence between individuals and affords strengthened protection to exchanges between lawyers and their clients the court further observed that the protection of this provision covers not only the activity of defense but also legal advice protecting the secrecy of such legal advice both with regard to its content and to its existence therefore other than in exceptional situations individuals consulting a lawyer must have a legitimate expectation that the lawyer will not disclose to anyone without their consent that they are consulting him or her the ecj went on to state that the obligation for a lawyerintermediary subject to legal professional privilege to notify other intermediaries of their reporting obligations necessarily entails the consequence that those other intermediaries become aware of the identity of the lawyerintermediary of their assessment that the arrangement at issue is reportable to the tax authorities and of their having been consulted in connection with the said arrangement in those circumstances the ecj concluded that the notification obligation imposed on lawyerintermediaries interferes with the right to respect for communications between lawyers and their clients guaranteed in article 7 of the charter the ecj then examined whether this interference may be justified by the pursuit of an objective of general interest and is appropriate and necessary for the attainment of this objective while the court acknowledged that the notification obligation established by the directive is intended to contribute to the prevention of the risk of tax avoidance and evasion which constitute objectives of general interest recognised by the eu that obligation cannot according to the court be regarded as being strictly necessary to attain those objectives this is because the reporting obligation imposed by the directive already applies to all intermediaries involved in the same reportable crossborder arrangement which is sufficient to ensure that the tax authorities are informed of potentially aggressive crossborder tax arrangements without the need for a lawyerintermediary to be involved the ecj then examined whether the notification obligation imposed on lawyerintermediaries interferes with the right to a fair trial guaranteed in article 47 of the charter the court found that this was not the case because the requirements implied by the right to a fair trial presuppose by definition a link with judicial proceedings while the notification obligation in question arises outside the framework of legal proceedings or their preparation implications  including for competition law matters footnotes 1 council directive 201116eu of 15 february
