They target products under CN code 2710. \n\nIn 2022, the Russian Federation was cushioned against crude oil and gas-based sanction effects as a result of the global rise in oil and gas prices. The price cap sanction was introduced in an attempt to remove the cushion so the revenue which is earned by Russia is restricted and the price of it will not rise when world oil and gas product prices rise in the future. As the EU imported a greater proportion of Russian exported refined oil than crude oil, the impact of this new sanction will be greater.\n\nSanctions\nSanctions on refined oil products were effected on 5 February 2023 and apply to the following Russian oil products falling under combined nomenclature code 2710, being \"Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (excluding crude); preparations containing >= 70% by weight of petroleum oils or of oils obtained from bituminous minerals, these oils being the basic constituents of the preparations, n.e.s.; waste oils containing mainly petroleum or bituminous minerals.\":\n High value (premium-to-crude products), including Gasoline (Petrol), Diesel fuel, Jet fuel/Kerosene\n Low value (discount-to-crude products), including Naphtha, High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO)\n\nThe G7 countries, plus the rest of the EU and Australia are amongst the main countries imposing the sanctions\n\nAs with the 2022 Russian oil price cap, sanctions come in two parts:\n\n1) A ban by each sanctioning country on importing any Russian refined oil products.\n\n2) Sanctions apply to anyone facilitating the maritime transport of refined oil products originating in Russia if the goods are not traded at or beneath the cap levels, including,Trading/commodities brokering, Financing, Shipping, Insurance, including reinsurance and protection and indemnity, Flagging and Customs brokering. \n\nA transitional period of 55 days is granted for vessels carrying Russian petroleum products, purchased and loaded prior to 5 February and unloaded prior to 1 April 2023.\n\nSanctions cease when the oil product is landed outside of Russian territory and handed to the purchaser or blending operations in a third country “result in a tariff shift” or changes in the oil product type.\n\nPrice Cap price\nWithin the EU, there had been a lengthy debate about the determination of a price cap for the various products with Poland and the Baltic countries wanting lower prices.\n\nPrice cap levels agreed by G7 and the EU on 3 February 2023:  The prices will be kept under review.\nPremium-to-crude products, including diesel, kerosene and gasoline - US$100per barrel\nDiscount-to-crude products, including fuel oil - US$45per barrel\n\nRussian oil products \n\nRussia refines around 5.5m barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate, the third largest in the world. Roughly 50% was exported in 2021 and 2022. The EU in 2021 received around 2m bpd of fuel oil from Russia, around 70% of Russia's exports.\n\nRussian exports in 2021:\n Diesel - 0.85m bpd (120,000 tonnes per day) (3.5% of global demand) \n Petroleum naphtha and gasoline - 0.7m bpd (100,000 tonnes per day) (0.5m bpd Naphtha, 0.2m bpd gasoline)\n Fuel oil and vacuum gas oil - 1m bpd (140,000 tonnes per day)\n\nThe Russian government pays refiners a critical subsidy known as the \"buffer mechanism\" for refining oil for domestic markets varies by month between 15,000 and 30,000 rubles per metric ton ($30 to $60 per barrel) for diesel and $17 per barrel for gasoline. This keeps fuel prices low in Russia and allows refiners a small profit.\n\nRussia charges an export duty on oil products, in May 2023 Light Oil products was $4.2 per tonne (compared to $12.9 in December 2022), Naphtha duty was $7.9 and gasoline $4.3 per tonne.\n\nReactions\n\nThe EU\nVarious EU countries increased their stocks of refined oil products, especially diesel ahead of the sanction ban.\n\nRussia\nRussia is looking to try to change trade routes for their refined oil products. India and China are both exporters of oil products, so new markets needed to be found. Algeria, Brazil, Ghana, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates have received diesel oil products in March, some are new destinations, other have received an increased supply. Russia has increased its storage of diesel in ships, from around 1m to 4m barrels in early April 2023, tying up tankers and indicating problems in finding buyers. Land storage of diesel had also increased to over 23m barrels in December 2022.\n\nThe domestic Russian price of some oil products collapsed in 2022 as supply exceeded demand following falls in exports.\n\nClean tankers \nClean tankers are ones that transports finished petroleum products so as to maintain their quality.\n\nIn March 2023, following the introduction of the sanction package, the average freight rates had doubled. Tankers are needing to travel further, increasing costs per shipload and are now taking an average of 16-18 days to travel trans Atlantic, such as USA to Europe and Russia to Brazil, compared to 5-6 days to travel from Russia to Europe, increasing the shortage of available tankers. The average size of a tanker containing oil products is a third of that of a crude oil tanker, which increases costs and uses more tankers to transport oil products long distances.\n\nIn September 2023 around 33% of oil products shipped from Russia were using shadow tankers which are not owned by or use facilities provided by sanctioning nations, so are not subject to the price cap policy.\n\nEffect of sanctions and price cap \n\nThere has been no effect from the price cap sanction as prices have remained low. The restrictions on shipping facilities have had a small effect. \n\nThe main impacts of the sanctions has been the EU ban on imports, requiring Russia to sell their refined oil to distant markets.\n\nFebruary to March 2023 \nRussian produced diesel was reported to be selling for around $75 per barrel in February. Exports by sea of Russian oil products fell 10.4% from 11.781m tons in January to 9.531m tons in February.\n\nAlbania arrested the Russian captain and seized the Liberian registered oil tanker, “Grace Felix”, trying to deliver 22,500 tons of Marine Gasoil 1000 PPM, worth Euro 40million, believed to be Russian fuel transferred ship to ship.\n\nRussia has lost their EU market and has been trying to find alternate destinations for refined oil. 3m barrels of clean refined products to Central and South America, up from 1.3m, with Morocco also increasing purchases of diesel. Russia has shipped by rail 30,000 tons of diesel and other refined fuels to Iran this year, opening a new trade. Turkey increased their buying by 50% and bought 10m barrels of diesel in March.\n\nRussia is planning on reducing refined oil output.\n\nApril to June 2023 \nRussian exports of clean petroleum product (CPP) to Europe from the Baltic have fallen from over 700,000bpd to just over 100,000bpd. The products are now being shipped on longer journeys, with Turkey, Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East each taking around 100,000bpd more than in 2021 or 2022 tying up clean shipping and undercutting in price of the world market for these products.\n\nRussian exports of diesel and gasoil were down again, by 21% to 3.1m tonnes in May. Russian tax revenue on crude and oil products in May fell 31% to 425.8 billion rubles. In June refineries were processing 5.4m bpd.\n\nJuly to September 2023 \nIn July, the European & G7 shipping industry transported 65% of Russian refined oil products. In 2023, Turkey has been buying 24% of Russian refined oil, China 12% and Saudi Arabia 10%.\n\nIn late July 2023 the price for Russian diesel, for the first time, topped the price of $100 per barrel price cap level, having risen 50% since early May. This will be seen as a test of the effectiveness of the sanctions and whether tankers previously carrying refined products for Russia will drop out of the market, tankers being paid a premium price to transport Russian refined products. In September Russia imposed a ban on the export of diesel and petrol, reversed in October.\n\nSee also\n\nExternal links\n, OFAC Guidance on Implementation of the Price Cap Policy\n\nReferences \n\nSanctions and boycotts during the Russo-Ukrainian War\n2020s in international relations\nForeign relations of Russia\nInternational sanctions\nSanctions against Russia\nReactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine", "unikey": "2023 Russian oil products sanctions and price cap", "summary": "As part of the sanctions which have been imposed on the Russian Federation as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 2 September 2022, finance ministers of the G7 group of nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil and petroleum products in an effort which was intended to reduce Russia's ability to finance its war on Ukraine and curb further increases in the 2021–2022 inflation surge.[1]\n", "outlines": ["Sanctions", "Price_Cap_price", "Russian_oil_products", "Reactions", "Effect_of_sanctions_and_price_cap", "See_also", "External_links", "References"], "contents": ["Sanctions on refined oil products were effected on 5 February 2023and apply to the following Russian oil products falling undercombined nomenclaturecode 2710,being \"Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (excluding crude); preparations containing >= 70% by weight of petroleum oils or of oils obtained from bituminous minerals, these oils being the basic constituents of the preparations, n.e.s.; waste oils containing mainly petroleum or bituminous minerals.\":\nTheG7countries, plus the rest of theEUand Australia are amongst the main countries imposing the sanctions\nAs with the2022 Russian oil price cap, sanctions come in two parts:\n1)A ban by each sanctioning country on importing any Russian refined oil products.\n2) Sanctions apply to anyone facilitating the maritime transport of refined oil products originating in Russia if the goods are not traded at or beneath the cap levels,including,Trading/commodities brokering, Financing, Shipping, Insurance, including reinsurance and protection and indemnity, Flagging and Customs brokering.\nA transitional period of 55 days is granted for vessels carrying Russian petroleum products, purchased and loaded prior to 5 February and unloaded prior to 1 April 2023.\nSanctions cease when the oil product is landed outside of Russian territory and handed to the purchaser or blending operations in a third country “result in a tariff shift” or changes in the oil product type.\n", "Within the EU, there had been a lengthy debate about the determination of a price cap for the various products with Poland and the Baltic countries wanting lower prices.\nPrice cap levels agreed by G7 and the EU on 3 February 2023:The prices will be kept under review.\n", "Russia refines around 5.5m barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate, the third largest in the world.

chairman dies after falling from a moscow hospital window russia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap we will simply not supply oil and petroleum products to such companies or states that impose restrictions as we will not work noncompetitively deputy prime minister alexander novak told reporters thursday according to state news agency tass the biden administration has been pushing for governments to introduce a price cap for months the west has already sanctioned many russian energy exports but moscow has continued to earn billions of dollars a month by diverting oil to countries such as china and india the price cap is specifically designed to reduce russian revenues and russias ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of russia s war on global energy prices particularly for low and middleincome countries the g7 finance ministers said natalia kolesnikovaafpgetty images g7 countries agree to cap the price of russian oil but the measure still needs work and will be extremely complex to manage the price at which russian oil will be capped still needs to be hashed out it would also need wider international support to be effective what china and india do is going to need to be a national decision for them a senior us treasury department official said on a call with reporters friday but if the cap forces russia to strike cheaper deals with trading partners by putting a ceiling on the price at which they can sell their products it will still achieve its goals the official added novak has called the proposals to impose restrictions completely absurd and said they could destroy the global oil market tass reported such attempts will only destabilize the oil industry the oil market he said russia could offer alternative insurance for its oil shipments but the us treasury official noted they would be more expensive raising incentives for buyers to opt in to the price cap

already introduced an import ban on russian oil products therefore the caps will not be used by the uk chancellor of the exchequer jeremy hunt said undermining putins war machine through further

shoulder to shoulder with our allies in continuing to pile the pressure on putins revenues while standing in solidarity with the ukrainian people g7 finance ministers agreed to capping the price of

this collaboration has been key given the major role of uk services in facilitating maritime trade for example the uk is a global leader in the provision of protection and indemnity pi insurance cover which relates to thirdpart liability claims  60 of the global cover provided by the international group of the pi clubs is written in the uk given the number of varied oil products on the market two caps have been introduced to cover two categories of refined oil products premiumtocrude products are those of high export value often used for transport and electricity generation such as kerosenebased jet fuel and diesel while discounttocrude pertains to products of a lesser value like naphtha the twocap approach has been introduced as this is the simplest to implement and most workable for industry to implement the price caps the government has laid domestic legislation and published uk guidance to help industry prepare for and implement the requirements of each cap the

sanctions for the first time but it held its own  for now we explain what happens nextsergey teplyakov exclusively for novaya gazeta europephoto getty imagesthe sanctions imposed on russian oil and gas have started succeeding in their goal european deliveries have almost stopped while the price of russian oil has fallen significantly in december this led to a recordbreaking monthly deficit of the federal budget  38 trillion rubles 494 billion the government was able to fulfil the revenue plan mostly due to a onetime payout from the gas giant gazprom estimated at 12 trillion rubles 156 billion but whose money tree will the authorities shake this year furthermore the biggest hit is still to come  the embargo on russian oil products will come into force in february novayaeurope attempts to estimate whether russia will be able to continue funding the war in 2023 taking into account the growing sanctions pressurewere sanctions really effective yes russian oil began to quickly go down in price in december by the end of the month the average price of urals had been 504 per barrel the drop in prices continued in january too some of the oil was being sold at 37 per barrel for the three months before that a barrel of urals was being sold for 2025 more prices of other grades of oil were going down too the average price of brent was 10 lower in december compared to october but the price of urals dropped significantly harder the difference between urals and brent surpassed 30 despite the fact that the gap stayed at the 2224 level from august to november before the russian invasion of ukraine urals was only 13 cheaper than brentthe price difference between urals and brent grew by about 10 immediately after the new sanctions had come into force on 5 december the main reason for the urals price drop aside from the decrease of worldwide prices is the european embargo president of the institute for energy and finance foundation fief marcel salikhov notes in the conversation with novayaeuropemore on the sanctionsmore on the sanctionsaccording to the fief estimates the discount offered for urals compared to brent has reached 37 per barrel the increase of the discount on urals is mostly connected to the increase in costs of freight to the end customer fief analysts think it takes 31 days to get from the baltic ports to india seven days to rotterdam and 34 days to poland furthermore it is also a payment for the risk the transporters of russian oil take upon themselves the freight cost is put into the discount salikhov explains russia exports other grades of oil not only urals in particular the eastern siberiapacific ocean pipeline oil which is mostly exported to china this grade is still being sold without any substantial discount in comparison to brent the analysts note but the share of this export is not large 7080 of physical oil deliveries come from cheaper urals salikhov notes furthermore the maritime oil export from russia has not showcased a stable trend of decreasing as of now in the past four weeks maritime supplies of oil have been on the same level as in the second half of 2022 bloomberg reported on 23 january flows of russian oil have been redirected to asia  mainly to india and china salikhov explainsrussian companies have to look for other buyers those were possibly drawn to the big discount he says the december drop did not have a big impact on the annual results in 2022 oil production in russia grew by 2 and oil export by 7 vice prime minister alexander novak previously saidso the budget withstood the hit by the end of december the budget saw a recordbreaking monthly deficit estimated at 38 trillion rubles 494 billion the problem is not only the embargo the budget expenditure basically tripled in december the reason being that many budgetrelated spendings are postponed to the end of the year furthermore there was a surplus from the previous months 557 billion rubles or 72 billion the average price of urals in januarydecember 2022 was 76 per barrel  7 more than in 2021 this is how the russian federal budget fulfilled its annual revenue plans the budget revenue in 2022 amounted to 278 trillion rubles 3614 billion  100 billion rubles above the plan oil and gas revenue grew by 279 in 2022 all other revenue increased by 01it is important to note that the dividends from the recordbreaking revenue of gazprom were also counted in the oil and gas revenue furthermore the government seized gazproms money that the state company had earned before the war gazprom paid the government an additional 12 trillion rubles 156 billion in mining taxes  half of its 2021 profit still the budget expenditure in 2022 ended up being 22 trillion rubles 286 billion higher than planned russias finance ministry revised its assessment of the deficit three times at the end of september the expected deficit was estimated at 13 trillion rubles 169 billion which is 09 of gdp on 8 december the ministry revised its assessment once again estimating the deficit at 29 trillion rubles 377 billion which is 2 of gdp the actual deficit was even higher in 2022 the federal budget received 33 trillion rubles 429 billion less than needed or 23 of gdp this may indicate that the sudden drop in oil prices was a surprise for the ministry of financebarrel to ruble ratewhile worldwide oil prices are important for the government so is how many rubles will end up going to the budget this factor depends on the national currency exchange rate in december a barrel of urals cost 3300 rubles 429 according to the telegram channel mmi founded by the current director of the monetary and credit policy department of russias central bank kirill tremasov this is the lowest price since the end of 2020 furthermore the next years budget assumes the price of 4800 rubles 624 per barrel in 2022 the price per barrel during the peak exceeded 9000 rubles 117 the telegram channels authors have also calculated the real price of an urals barrel adjusted for inflation according to their estimates the price is some of the lowest it has been in the past 10 years the price is equal to the 2016 one it only went lower for a short time during the beginning of the pandemic according to salikhov these calculations adequately showcase the losses suffered by the russian budget what about budget reserves to make up for the deficit russias finance ministry issued federal loan bonds and used the funds from the russian national wealth fund in total 4 trillion rubles 52 billion of the funds money were spent in 2022 over a trillion went to support state corporations by the way of purchasing stocks and bonds among the state companies are russian railways aeroflot and the federal road agency during last year the liquid part of the national wealth fund as in the part not invested into projects shrunk to 61 trillion rubles 793 billionthe term liquid for the uninvested part of the fund is a leftover from the past after the introduction of sanctions against the central bank dollars euro pounds and yen on its accounts were frozen to spend them the funds money is virtually deducted and rubles are printed instead yen has become the main currency of the national wealth fund it will play a big role in compensating for the shortage of the budget this is the only foreign currency used by the national wealth fund that had not been sanctioned leading economist on emerging markets for oxford economics tatiana orlova explains there are no other ways to conduct currency interventions theres not much to be spent theres also gold but the west sanctioned it it can be sold only to friendly countries its not very liquid it could bring about secondary sanctions so china is not very keen on buying our gold for these reasons orlova says according to the endoftheyear data the national wealth fund was storing 309 billion yen  about 31 trillion rubles or 403 billion  which is about half of the fund in the middle of january the central bank announced that it would start selling the funds yen the money will be used to make up for the underreceived oil and gas revenue the ministry of finance explained the sales will be carried out in accordance with the new budgetary rule the rule stipulates a target plan on oil and gas revenue that amounts to 8 trillion rubles 104 billion per year the shortage will be made up through the sale of currency belonging to the fundthe old budgetary rule and how it workedthe old budgetary rule and how it workedcurrency interventions have started happening now because the oil price is lower than the one assumed in the budget so the revenue has to be compensated with money from the national wealth fund at the same time it supports the rubles standing so it doesnt continue getting weaker and doesnt contribute to the growth of inflation orlova notes in january russias ministry of finance plans to sell 545 billion rubles 7085 million in yen but it admits that the amount of the underreceived revenue could end up being a higher number due to the fall of gas exportfor how long will russia be able to fund the war as of now it is hard to make confident predictions due to the fact that sanctions on oil products will come into force in february salikhov and orlova say their assessment is that the sanctions will hurt export deliveries more than the previous restrictions on crude oil and will lead to reduced oil productionwhat do we meanwhat do we meanin 2021 about half of the russian oil products export went to europe for example almost all of the fuel oil produced in russia went to europe salikhov notes in total russia exported 70 billion worth of oil products in 2021 russias oil products are more vulnerable to sanctions because the logistics of their deliveries are more complicated salikhov explains an average tanker that transports oil products is about 34 times smaller than a tanker that transports crude oil so the logistics are more expensive russias main markets right now are china and india these countries have their own quite big oil refining  theyre interested in buying crude oil with a discount and then refining it he says as a result russian companies can partially opt out of oil refining and will sell crude oil its quite possible that crude oil export will remain stable but oil extraction will decline due to the decrease in production of oil products salikhov continues using the finance ministry table with the analysis of scenarios involving oil and gas revenue depending on the production rate and the price of urals one can estimate the approximate budget deficit the calculations assume that 1 equals 683 rubles the united states department of energy and the international energy agency predict that by the end of 2023 oil production in russia will have gone down from 107 million barrels per day to 95 million barrels per day with a barrel of urals going for 60 the russian budget will underreceive 600 billion rubles 78 billion if it is sold at 50 per barrel the deficit will amount to 16 trillion rubles 208 billion and with the current 45 per barrel it will go up to 22 trillion rubles 286 billion the deficit could grow even more due to the additional budget expenditure primarily on the war according to novayaeuropes estimates additional 23 trillion rubles 2639 billion could be needed for payments to mobilised servicemen and compensations for injury or death in combat however these numbers are very hard to predict we cant take into account different horrible scenarios escalation new mobilisation waves if the situation continues to worsen then bigger military expenditure will have to be assumed in the budget orlova says for example if the expenditure turns out to be higher than the planned one by at least one trillion rubles 13 billion the urals price remains at the current level but oil production decreases to 95 million barrels per day the budget deficit will double  from the currentlyplannedfor 29 trillion rubles 377 billion to 6 trillion 78 billion this is roughly the same as the amount of yen saved up in the national wealth fund and the states federal loan bonds in 2022 to make up for this deficit the government will have to either sell all yen in its reserves so almost all of foreign currency or start borrowing significantly more last year the finance ministry already borrowed 33 trillion rubles 429 billion through federal loan bonds  700 billion rubles 91 billion more compared to the previous yearhow else can authorities patch holes urals at 50 is quite a dangerous price for the budget in its current structure so the government will have to take additional measures orlova speculates she acknowledges that if the central bank had not started conducting yen interventions then possibly it would have had to issue more federal loan bonds the big volume of federal loan bonds has to be paid for with high rates which also increases the strain on the budget its an expensive measure its wiser to combine loans and spending from the national wealth fund orlova explains if the urals price does not increase the government will probably have to decrease the budget expenditure in the second half of 2023 or 2024 the expert thinks according to bloomberg as of now the government plans to only cut down 150 billion rubles 195 billion of expenditure all of it not related to defence furthermore the government has other ways of finding additional money for example they can repeat the scenario of seizing gazproms earnings there are still enough companies  one can easily imagine the government gathering up the leaders of big companies and saying so guys you earned a lot of money its time to share orlova says despite the drop in european exports there is still some money to be seized from gazprom too salikhov speculatesthere are still exports to turkey china two thirds of gas are consumed domestically there wont be any additional seizures or big dividends but gazprom will still have some profit coming in additionally they can raise prices domestically for example the government raised them by 8 on 1 december he says the government has already approved a change in tax legislation that will allow it to collect several more trillion rubles from oil and gas companies in the next three years in particular there are plans to tax gazprom an additional 600 billion rubles 78 billion annually other changes include raising the mineral extraction tax and the tax rate on profit of lng producers  from the current 20 to 34 the government also plans to mobilise funds of coal and fertiliser producers using onetime payments and higher dividends bloomberg reported there are other sectors of the economy that could be made to share for example imposing a oneoff tax it will be easier to decide at some point by agreement if they do it on a oneoff basis it will hurt companies willingness to conduct any business in russia

blackseanews and the black sea institute of strategic studie the monitoring group of the black sea institute of strategic studies and blackseanews based on the results of its own monitoring see table 1 presents a database of seaborne exports of crude oil and petroleum products from russian ports on the black and azov seas in august 2023 in total in august 2023 207 tankers exported oil and petroleum products from russian ports excluding exports to bulgaria and romania they transported a total of about 133 million tons of cargo including 32 million tons of russian crude oil 26 tankers 66 million tons of kazakh cpc crude oil 48 tankers and 35 million tons of russian petroleum products 133 tankers see a detailed analysis in articles in the russian bloodsoaked export section notes a the russian federation exports crude oil and oil products  fuel oil gas oil and diesel fuel  from the ports of the black and azov seas the cargo is carried by two different types of vessels  crude oil tankers and oilchemical oil product tankers respectively while crude oil tankers are usually very large and in the black sea each of them is capable of taking 100 to 150 thousand tons of crude oil oil product tankers have a much smaller carrying capacity in the 35 and 2530 thousand ton ranges the monthly ratio of crude oil to oil product exports is approximately 31 b there are two separate streams of crude oil exported from the black sea ports russian crude oil  from the ports of novorossiysk taman tuapse the raid transshipment in the kerch strait and south of it and crude oil of the caspian pipeline consortium cpc  from a special terminal in the port of novorossiysk the latter contains 80 kazakh oil and 20 oil produced in kazakhstan by the russian lukoil company despite the fact that it is transported via the russian territory kazakh oil is currently not subject to sanctions c when showing the crude oil and petroleum product export figures the tables and diagrams use the deadweight dwt indicator  the total carrying capacity of a vessel or the total weight of variable cargo in tons including that of fuel lubricating oil technical and drinking water passengers with luggage crew and food the latter does not significantly affect the overall numbers since even on tankers with a deadweight of 100150 thousand tons the cumulative weight of fuel water food and a small crew totals mere hundreds of tons thus not altering the analysis results d the report does not take into account the volumes of russian crude oil and oil products exports to the romanian and bulgarian black sea ports and raid transshipments for reference in july 2022 those exports are estimated at about 31 million tons  19 million tons to romania and 12 million to bulgaria of those russian crude oil accounts for about 24 million tons  14 million tons to romania and 10 million to bulgaria e for convenience the tables and diagrams use the term eu that besides the eu member states also includes the us the uk and monaco such grouping is justified by the fact that russias oil and oil product exports to these countries are very small f the tanker database given at the end of the report uses the crude oil tanker cpc identification for tanker that transport crude oil from the caspian pipeline consortium terminal tankers transporting crude oil from the russian federation are entered as just crude oil
