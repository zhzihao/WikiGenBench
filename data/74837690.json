The winter storm, unofficially named Winter Storm Sage by The Weather Channel, first progressed across the Western United States as an atmospheric river, and then moved across the northern United States, bringing blizzard conditions and moderate snowfall across the Northern U.S.. The winter storm then became a nor'easter and impacted the Northeast, bringing snowfall rates of  per hour across numerous locations across the Northeast and  of snow in several locations across the region with locally higher amounts. More than 320,000 power outages occurred across the areas impacted by the winter storm, and caused three fatalities and two injuries. Readsboro, Vermont received  of snow, and nearly 200 car accidents occurred across the New England region in the Northeast.\n\nMeteorological synopsis \nOn March 10, a frontal system moved eastward across the western U.S. from the Pacific Northwest, with the main low pressure area associated with the system located offshore of southwestern Washington and a separate area of low-pressure east of the California/Nevada border. As a result, an atmospheric river developed, bringing heavy rainfall and high snow accumulations to portions of the Western United States and Sierra Nevada. The atmospheric river then transitioned into a winter storm as it then moved across the northern United States on March 11–12, bringing blizzard conditions and moderate snowfall across the Northern United States, producing additional snowfall accumulations across the region. The winter storm then became a nor'easter as another low-pressure area developed off the Carolina coast and moved northward along the coastline of the Northeastern United States, bringing snowfall rates of  per hour across numerous locations across the Northeast for the next several days. The winter storm brought  of snow in some locations across the Northeastern United States, with locally higher amounts.

Maine Governor Janet Mills ordered all government offices to close.\n\nPrior to the winter storm, John Palmer of the National Weather Service office in Gray, Maine stated that the precipitation may cause significant power disruptions that last for over 48 hours.

The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories from Pennsylvania to Maine.\n\nImpact\n\nWestern United States \n\nThe strong atmospheric river that developed into the winter storm impacted California on March 10, producing heavy rainfall which caused flooding across lower elevations of the state, and heavy snowfall brought high snowfall totals across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
