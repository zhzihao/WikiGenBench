As of 2023, Super Heavy prototypes are being flight tested. In April 2023, Super Heavy flew for the first time on the first orbital launch attempt of the Starship rocket.\n\nManufacturing \nAccording to Eric Berger of Ars Technica, the manufacturing process starts with rolls of steel, which are unrolled, cut, and welded along the cut edge to create a cylinder of 9 m (30 ft) in diameter, 1.82 m (6 ft) in height, and 4 mm (0.16 in) thick, and around 1,600 kg (4,000 lb) in mass. These cylinders are stacked and welded along their edges to form the outer layer of the rocket. Inside, the methane and oxygen tanks are separated by robot-made domes. Before final assembly, grid fins are added to the interstage, and the chines are added after stacking of the propellant tanks.\n\nDesign \nThe first-stage Super Heavy booster is  tall,  wide,  and is composed of four general sections: the engine section, the fuel tank, the oxygen tank, and the interstage including hot staging. Elon Musk has stated that the final design will have a dry mass between  and , with the tanks weighing  and the interstage .\n\nTanks \nThe fuel tank on the Super Heavy is separated by a common bulkhead, similar to the ones used on the S-II and S-IVB stages on the Saturn V rocket. The oxygen tank has four chines attached. These protect the COPVs, CO2 tanks for fire suppression, as well as providing lift during flight. \n\nThe booster's tanks were reported as holding  of propellant, consisting of  of liquid oxygen and  of liquid methane. However, current booster prototypes can only hold  of propellant.\n\nEngines \nThe engine section supports the 33 raptor engines during flight. The engines are arranged in three concentric rings. The outer ring of 20 engines is of the \"Raptor Boost\" configuration with gimbal actuators removed to save weight and a modified injector with reduced throttle performance in exchange for greater thrust. Raptor utilizes a full-flow staged combustion cycle, which has both Oxygen and Methane rich turbopumps.\n\nPrior to 2014, only two full-flow staged-combustion rocket engine designs had advanced enough to undergo testing on test stands: the Soviet RD-270 project in the 1960s and the Aerojet Rocketdyne Integrated Powerhead Demonstrator in the mid-2000s.\n\nAt full power, all engines produce a collective  of thrust. However, Raptor 3 is planned to bring thrust up to .\n\nInterstage \nThe interstage is also equipped with four electrically actuated grid fins, each with a mass of . Adjacent pairs of grid fins are only spaced sixty degrees apart instead of being orthogonal (as is the case on Falcon 9) to provide more authority in the pitch axis. Unlike Falcon 9, the grid fins do not retract and remain extended during ascent. During unpowered flight in the vacuum of space, control authority is provided by cold gas thrusters fed with residual ullage gas.\n\nThe interstage also has protruding hardpoints, located between grid fins, allowing the booster to be lifted or caught by the launch tower.\n\nAfter the first Starship test flight, all boosters will now have an additional 2m tall vented interstage added, as well as a protective dome. Elon Musk has indicated this change may gain an additional 10% payload to orbit as a result.\n\nMission profile \n\nAbout one hour and thirty-nine minutes before flight, the super heavy booster begins propellant load. At the T- 16:40 mark, engine chill begins on the booster. This is to protect the engine's turbopumps from thermal shock. At eight seconds before flight, the thirty-three engines startup-sequence begins. \n\nAfter liftoff, the engines burn for 169 seconds, at which point 30 of its engines shut off, leaving only three center ones running at 50% thrust. Then, the ship ignites its engines while still attached to the booster and separates. The boostback burn lasts for 55 seconds. About eight minutes to flight, the engines reignite, and the booster is caught by a pair of mechanical arms.\n\nDevelopment\n\nBoosters do not have an engine skirt. Without engines, boosters are about 3 meters shorter.\n\nBN1 \nBN1 was the first Super-Heavy Booster prototype, a pathfinder that was not intended for flight tests. Sections of the ~ tall test article were manufactured throughout the fall. Section stacking began in December 2020. BN1 was fully stacked inside the High Bay on 18 March. On 30 March 2021, BN1 was scrapped.\n\nBN3/B3 \nBN3 (Booster 3) was used for ground tests. A cryogenic proof test was completed (13 July 2021). Booster 3 completed stacking in the High Bay (29 June 2021), and moved to the test pad without engines. Three engines were subsequently added.\n\nA static fire test was conducted 19 July 2021. BN3/Booster 3 was partially scrapped on 15 August 2021, while the LOX tank remained welded to the Test Stand. The LOX tank was taken off the Test Stand on the 13th January 2022.\n\nB4 \nBooster 4 first became visible on 3 July 2021. Musk ordered several hundred SpaceX employees at Hawthorne to relocate to Boca Chica to accelerate the development of SN20, BN4, and the Orbital Launch Platform in an attempt to put the Starship system on the pad by 5 August 2021. BN4 was fully stacked on 1 August, with a full complement of 29 engines installed on 2 August 2021. Grid fins were added to support atmospheric reentry testing.\n\nSN20 was stacked on top of Booster 4 on 6 August 2021 for a fitting test, making it the largest rocket ever. Booster 4 was then returned to the High Bay for secondary wiring. On 9 September 2021, Booster 4 came again to the launch site on top of the Orbital Launch mount.\n\nB4 completed its first cryogenic proof test (17 December 2021), and a pneumatic proof test (19 December 2021). It underwent another cryogenic proof test and a full-load cryogenic proof test. B4 and Ship 20 were then retired.\n\nB5 \nParts for B5 were observed as early as 19 July 2021. Stacking for BN5 completed in November, although on 8 December 2021, B5 retired to stand alongside SN15 and SN16.\n\nB7 \n\nParts for B7 were first spotted on 29 September 2021. B7 was placed on the orbital launch mount on 31 March 2022. After completing a cryogenic proof test on 4 April 2022, it was placed onto the new booster test stand on 8 April 2022. B7 completed another cryogenic test on 14 April 2022, but the downcomer suffered a failure and ruptured. On 18 April 2022, B7 returned to the production site for repairs. On 5 May 2022, B7 was again placed on the orbital launch mount. B7 then completed two cryogenic tests on 9 and 11 May 2022. It was then returned back to the production site and entered the new Mega Bay (also known as Wide Bay or High Bay 2), for repairs and additional equipment, upgraded grid fins and engines, and two more 'chines' or 'strakes' (triangular structures placed on the aft section to aid in aerodynamic control). B7 went through more testing (11 July 2022) where it experienced an anomaly during an attempted 33 engine spin prime test and a detonation occurred underneath the engines. The booster then rolled back to the Mega Bay. B7 was transported back to the orbital launch pad with 20 outer Raptor engines (August 4 to August 5, 2022) and completed its first single engine static fire test (August 9, 2022). B7 completed a 20-second static fire (August 11, 2022), the longest static fire on a Starship prototype to date. Following a successful set of tests, it returned to the production site to receive the remaining 13 engines. B7 was lifted back onto the launch mount using the chopsticks catching and lifting system (23 August 2022). It underwent further testing including its 13 inner engines (26 August 2022). B7 completed a multi-engine static fire (31 August 2022). This was followed by multiple spin prime tests, and a seven-engine static fire on 19 September 2022. B7 again returned to the Mega Bay on 21 September 2022. After upgrades it was again lifted on the launch pad (8 October 2022). Ship 24 was then stacked on top B7 (12 October 2022) and was removed after completing multiple cryogenic load tests. B7 then completed a spin prime test of multiple engines, (12 November 2022) and afterwards a 14 engine static fire test, (14 November 2022) and finally an 11 engine static fire in an autogenous pressurization test (29 November 2022). On December 9, 2022, B7 rolled back to the Mega Bay for further shielding. In January 2023, Booster 7 was rolled back to the launch site where it was stacked with Ship 24 on the OLM for partial and full Wet Dress Rehearsals (Jan 23) before Ship 24 was destacked and sent to the Rocket Garden for final TPS work. On February 9, 2023, Booster 7 attempted a 10 second duration 33-engine static fire where 31 of the 33 engines successfully fired for the full duration. One of its engines was disabled just prior to testing, and one engine shutdown prematurely. On April 20, 2023, it was intentionally destroyed in the SpaceX Starship Integrated Flight Test after spinning out of control.\n\nB8 \nThe first part of the booster, the engine thrust puck, was spotted on October 5, 2021. Other parts for B8 were observed on February 3, 2022. The booster was fully stacked on July 8, 2022. It travelled to the launch site on 19 September 2022. Booster 8 was scrapped soon after in favor of Booster 9, Booster 8's HPU's were placed on Booster 7 along with other parts.\n\nB9 \nThe engine thrust puck of the booster was first spotted on October 24, 2021. The vehicle finished stacking in late 2022, and was moved to the OLS cryo station on December 15, 2022. Two cryogenic proof tests were conducted on December 21, 2022, and December 29, 2022, both of which were successful. The booster was rolled back to the Mega Bay on January 10, 2023. Among many other upgrades, Booster 9 is the first to feature an electric Thrust Vector Control (often abbreviated to ETVC) gimbaling system of the raptor engines. This system replaces the hydraulics HPU's that were used until Booster 8. Booster 9 is currently slated to fly with Ship 25 on the second Integrated Flight Test. On July 20, Booster 9 was rolled out to the launch site. Later, in the night of July 20 to July 21, it was lifted onto the Orbital Launch Mount in preparation for its testing campaign. On July 23 Booster 9 performed a cryogenic prof test on the orbital launch mount. This was followed by a Spin Prime on August 4, 2023. On August 6, 2023, Booster 9 fired 29 engines for 2.7 seconds, instead of the planned 33 engines for 5 seconds. It was then moved off of the Orbital Launch Mount, and rolled back to the Mega Bay, where it's hot staging extension was added on August 16, 2023. B9 was moved back onto the Orbital Launch Mount on August 22, 2023, and underwent another spin prime test the next day. On August 25, 2023, Booster 9 underwent a static fire of all 33 engines, lasting around 6 seconds. Two engines shut off early during the test. On September 5, 2023, S25 was lifted onto B9 for the first time. On September 14, 2023, S25 was removed from B9, followed one week later by the Vented Interstage. On September 26, 2023, the Vented Interstage was lifted onto B9, only to be removed on October 9, 2023. It was lifted back onto B9 on October 16, 2023, along with S25. S25 was removed on October 17, 2023, and then lifted back onto B9 on October 20, 2023. On October 22, 2023, B9 underwent two partial cryogenic tests, while S25 was not tested. This was followed by a deluge test, also on October 22, 2023. On October 24, B9 and S25 completed a WDR, which was followed by another deluge test on the same day. On October 26, 2023, S25 was removed from B9, presumably for FTS installation. This was followed by the removal of the Vented Interstage one day later. The Vented Interstage was then placed back on B9 on October 28, 2023.\n\nB10 and subsequent boosters \n\nNot much is known about boosters 10 and 11, except that they also use booster 9's ETVC, as well as elliptical domes. B10 was fully stacked in March 2023. In June 2023, B11 was fully stacked, and B12 began assembly. On July 19, 2023, B10 underwent a cryogenic proof test. It was later moved to the rocket garden, and was then moved to the Mega Bay. However, on September 10, 2023, B10 was moved back to Masseys on a Thrust Simulator Stand. A croygenic test was performed 3 days later. As of September 13, 2023, it is unknown whether the Thrust Simulator was used during the test. It was moved back to the Mega Bay on September 20, 2023, presumably for engine and interstage installation. On October 12, 2023, B11 was moved to the Masseys test site on a Thrust Simulator Stand, where it was cryo tested two days later. It was then tested on October 18, 2023.\n\nTest articles\n\nGeneral test articles \nTest Tank 1 (TT1) was a subscale test tank consisting of two forward bulkheads connected by a small barrel section. TT1 was used to test new materials and construction methods. On 10 January 2020, TT1 was filled with water and tested to failure as part of an ambient temperature test, reaching a pressure of .\n\nTest Tank 2 (TT2) was another subscale test tank similar to TT1. On 27 January 2020, TT2 underwent an ambient temperature pressure test where it reached a pressure of  before a leak occurred. Two days later, it underwent a cryogenic proof test to destruction, bursting at .\n\nGSE 4.1 was first spotted in August 2021, and was the first ground support equipment (GSE) test tank built, made from parts of GSE 4. It underwent a cryogenic proof test (August 23) before it was rolled to Sanchez site. It was rolled back to the launch site in November 2021 and underwent an apparent cryogenic proof test to failure (January 18), where it burst at an unknown pressure.\n\nEDOME is a test tank created to test flatter domes, possibly used on future Starship prototypes. It was moved to the launch site in July 2022, and back to the production site the next month, and never received testing. It was later moved from the production site to the new Masseys site on 22 September 2022, which conducts non-flight hardware testing. On 30 September 2022, it burst during a cryogenic pressure test to failure. After repairs, it was tested to destruction in late October 2022.\n\nSuper Heavy-based test articles\nBN2.1 was rolled out on 3 June 2021 for cryogenic tests (8 June) and (17 June).\n\nB2.1 (not BN2.1) survived three cryogenic tests on 1, 2, and 3 December 2021.\n\nB6.1 was originally intended to be the third super heavy intended for flight, but was repurposed as a test tank. In May 2023, it was used to test the modified FTS system, after the FTS on B7 and S24 failed to destroy the vehicle. \n\nB7.1 was first cryogenically proof tested on 28 June 2022, and tested again on 19 July 2022. During a suspected pressurize to failure test two days later, it received minor damage. After repairs, it underwent a fourth cryogenic proof test (27 July), a fifth (1 September), and a sixth five days later. It then rolled back to the production site (16 September). B7.1 left the production site (22 September) to head to the new Masseys site.\n\nHot Stage Load Head (HSLH) is a test article designed for verify the structural integrity of the interstage of Super Heavy Boosters 9+. It was transported to the Massey's test site on July 30, 2023, before being loaded onto the Can Crusher testing device. As of August 29, 2023, it is believed to have completed testing. In mid October 2023, it was moved back to the production site, presumably for scrapping.\n\nSee also \n\n List of Falcon 9 first-stage boosters\n Starship HLS, lunar variant of the Starship spacecraft\n SpaceX Starbase, launch site of Super Heavy\n Starlink, large satellite constellation by SpaceX\n\nReferences\n\nSpaceX launch vehicles\nVTVL rockets\nProposed reusable launch systems\nReusable spaceflight technology\nReusable launch systems\nRocket stages\nSpaceX Starship\nSpaceX related lists", "unikey": "SpaceX Super Heavy", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Manufacturing", "Design", "Planned_mission_profile", "Development", "Test_articles", "See_also", "References"], "contents": ["The manufacturing process starts with rolls of steel, which are unrolled, cut, and welded along the edge to create a cylinder of 9 m (30 ft) in diameter, 1.829 m (6.00 ft) in height, and 3.97 mm (0.156 in) thick,and around 1600 kg (3,600 lb) in mass.[a]\nThese rings are stacked and welded along their edges to form the outer layer of the rocket.

B4 and Ship 20 were then retired.\nParts for B5 were observed as early as 19 July 2021.Stacking for BN5 completed in November, although on 8 December 2021, B5 was retired alongsideSN15andSN16. It was later scrapped.\n#### B7\nParts for B7 were first spotted on September 29, 2021. B7 was placed on the orbital launch mount on March 31. 2022. After completing a cryogenic proof test on April 4, 2022, it was placed onto the new booster test stand on April 8, 2022. B7 completed another cryogenic test on April 14, 2022, but the downcomer suffered a failure and ruptured. On April 18, 2022, B7 returned to the production site for repairs. On May 5, 2022, B7 was again placed on the orbital launch mount. B7 then completed two cryogenic tests on May 9 and May 11, 2022. It was then returned to the production site and entered the new Mega Bay 1, for repairs and additional equipment, upgraded grid fins and engines, and two more 'chines' or 'strakes' (triangular structures placed on the aft section to aid in aerodynamic control).On July 11, 2022, B7 experienced an anomaly during an attempted 33 engine spin prime test, resulting in a detonation underneath the engines.The booster then rolled back to Mega Bay 1.On August 4, 2022, B7 was transported back to the orbital launch pad with 20 outer Raptor engines,and completed its first single-engine static fire test on August 9, 2022. B7 completed a 20-second static fire on August 11, 2022, the longest static fire on a Starship prototype to date.Following these successful tests, it returned to the production site to receive the remaining 13 engines.B7 was lifted back onto the launch mount using the chopsticks catching and lifting system on August 23, 2022.It underwent further testing including its 13 inner engines on August 26, 2022. On August 31, 2022, B7 completed a multi-engine static fire.This was followed by multiple spin prime tests,and a seven-engine static fire on September 19, 2022.B7 again returned to the Mega Bay on 21 September 2022.After receiving additional upgrades it was again lifted on the launch pad on October 8, 2022.Ship 24 was stacked on top B7 on October 12, 2022,and was removed after completing multiple cryogenic load tests.B7 then completed a spin prime test of multiple engines on November 12, 2023,and a 14 engine static fire test on November 14, 2022,and finally an 11 engine static fire in an autogenous pressurization test on November 29, 2022.On December 9, 2022, B7 rolled back to Mega Bay 1for further shielding. In January 2023, Booster 7 was rolled back to the launch site where it was stacked with Ship 24 on the OLM for partial and full Wet Dress Rehearsalsbefore Ship 24 was detached and sent to the Rocket Garden for final TPS work. On February 9, 2023, Booster 7 attempted a 10-second duration 33-engine static fire where 31 of the 33 engines successfully fired for the full duration.One of its engines was disabled just before testing, and one engine shutdown prematurely. On April 20, 2023, it was intentionally destroyed in theSpaceX Starship First Integrated Flight Testafter losing connection to its engines.\n#### B8\nThe first part of the booster, the engine thrust puck, was spotted on October 5, 2021. Other parts for B8 were observed on February 3, 2022.The booster was fully stacked on July 8, 2022.It traveled to the launch site on 19 September 2022.Booster 8 was scrapped in January 2023 in favor of Booster 9, and Booster 8'shydraulic power unitswere placed on Booster 7 along with other parts.\n#### B9\nThe engine thrust puck of the booster was first spotted on October 24, 2021. The vehicle finished stacking in late 2022 and was moved to the OLS cryo station on December 15, 2022. Two cryogenic proof tests were conducted on December 21, 2022, and December 29, 2022, both of which were successful. The booster was rolled back to Mega Bay 1 on January 10, 2023. Among many other upgrades, Booster 9 is the first to feature an electricThrust vector control(often abbreviated to ETVC)gimbaling systemof the raptor engines. This system replaces thehydraulic power unitsthat were used until Booster 8. On July 20, Booster 9 was rolled out to the launch site. Later, on the night of July 20 to July 21, it was lifted onto the Orbital Launch Mount in preparation for its testing campaign.On July 23 Booster 9 performed a cryogenic prof test on the orbital launch mount.This was followed by a Spin Prime on August 4, 2023. On August 6, 2023, Booster 9 fired 29 engines for 2.7 seconds, instead of the planned 33 engines for 5 seconds. It was then moved off of the Orbital Launch Mount and rolled back to Mega Bay 1, where its vented interstage was added on August 16, 2023.B9 was moved back onto the Orbital Launch Mount on August 22, 2023, and underwent another spin prime test the next day.On August 25, 2023, Booster 9 underwent a static fire of all 33 engines, lasting around 6 seconds. Two engines shut off early during the test.On September 5, 2023,Ship 25(S25) was lifted onto B9 for the first time. On September 14, 2023, S25 was removed from B9, followed one week later by the vented interstage. On September 26, 2023, the vented interstage was lifted onto B9, only to be removed on October 9, 2023. It was lifted back onto B9 on October 16, 2023, along with S25.S25 was removed on October 17, 2023, and then lifted back onto B9 on October 20, 2023. On October 22, 2023, B9 underwent two partial cryogenic tests, while S25 was not tested. This was followed by a deluge test, also on October 22, 2023.On October 24, B9 and S25 completed aWDR,which was followed by another deluge test on the same day.On October 26, 2023, S25 was removed from B9, presumably forFTSinstallation.This was followed by the removal of the vented interstage one day later.The vented interstage was then placed back on B9 on October 28, 2023.On November 9, 2023, B9's FTS was installed. On November 10, 2023, S25 was stacked onto B9,and then destacked on November 11, 2023.The vented interstage was removed the next day.On November 15, 2023, the vented interstage was reattached to B9,followed by the stacking of S25 for theSecond Integrated Flight Test.Due to a failed grid fin actuator, S25 was destacked on November 16, and restacked on November 17, 2023.The following day, Saturday, November 18, 2023, Booster 9 as well as Ship 25, lifted off with all engines burning at 7:02 am CST. Following the successful separation from S25, B9 was destroyed after engine failures during the boost back burn.\n#### B10 and subsequent\nB10 and B11 are similar to B9, though they also use elliptical domes.B10 was fully stacked in March 2023.In June 2023, B11 was fully stacked, and B12 began assembly.On July 19, 2023, B10 underwent a cryogenic proof test. It was later moved to the rocket garden and was then moved to Mega Bay 1. However, on September 10, 2023, B10 was moved back to Massey's on a Thrust Simulator Stand. A cryogenic test was performed 3 days later.As of September 13, 2023, it is unknown whether the Thrust Simulator was used during the test. It was moved back to Mega Bay 1 on September 20, 2023, for engine and interstage installation. On October 12, 2023, B11 was moved to Massey's test site on a Thrust Simulator Stand, where it was cryo-tested two days later. It was then tested on October 18, 2023. On November 19, 2023, B11 was moved back to Mega Bay 1, presumably for engine and interstage installation.On December 4, 2023, B10 received its vented interstage.On December 5, 2023, B10 was moved to the Rocket Garden,and SpaceX confirmed that B10 would fly IFT-3 shortly after that.On December 11, 2023, B12 was moved onto engine installation 1.On December 18, 2023, B10 was moved to the orbital launch site,followed by a lift onto the OLM the next day.A static fire was attempted on December 21, 2023, however, it was aborted for unknown reasons.On December 28, 2023, B12 was moved onto a Thrust Simulator Stand, before being moved to Masseys for cryogenic testing.On December 29, 2023, B10 conducted a 33 engine static fire test,followed by its removal from the OLM on December 30, 2023.On January 2, 2024, B10 was moved back to the Production Site.On January 10, 2024, B12 underwent its first cryogenic test,and it underwent a second test on January 12, 2024.\n", "### General test articles\nTest Tank 1(TT1) was a subscale test tank consisting of two forward bulkheads connected by a small barrel section. TT1 was used to test new materials and construction methods. On 10 January 2020, TT1 was filled with water and tested for failure as part of an ambient temperature test, reaching a pressure of 7.1bar(103psi).\nTest Tank 2(TT2) was another subscale test tank similar to TT1. On 27 January 2020, TT2 underwent an ambient temperature pressure test where it reached a pressure of 7.5 bar (109 psi) before a leak occurred.Two days later, it underwent a cryogenic proof test to destruction, bursting at 8.5 bar (123 psi).\nGSE 4.1was first spotted in August 2021, and was the first ground support equipment (GSE) test tank built, made from parts of GSE 4. It underwent a cryogenic proof test (August 23) before it was rolled to Sanchez's site.It was rolled back to the launch site in November 2021. It underwent an apparent cryogenic proof test to failure (January 18), where it burst at an unknown pressure.\nEDOMEwas a test tank created to test flatter domes, possibly used on future Starship prototypes. It was moved to the launch site in July 2022, and then back to the production site the next month, after not undergoing any tests.It was later moved from the production site to the Massey's Test site in late September 2022, where it was damaged during a cryogenic pressure test to failure.After repairs, it was tested to destruction in late October 2022.\nEDOME 2was a test tank which is likely designed to continue testing a flatter dome design. As of October 4, 2023, its official designation is unknown. It was tested once, before being scrapped for unknown reasons.\n### Super Heavy-based test articles\nBN2.1was rolled out on 3 June 2021for cryogenic tests (8 June)and (17 June).\nB2.1(not BN2.1) survived three cryogenic tests on 1, 2, and 3 December 2021.\nB6.1was originally intended to be the third super heavy to launch, but was repurposed as a test tank.In May 2023, it was used to test the modified FTS system, after the FTS on B7 and S24 failed to destroy the vehicle.\nB7.1was first cryogenically proof tested on 28 June 2022,and tested again on 19 July 2022.During a suspected pressurize to failure test two days later, it received minor damage.After repairs, it underwent a fourth cryogenic proof test on July 27, 2022, a fifth on September 1, 2022, and a sixth five days later. It then rolled back to the production site on September 16, 2022.B7.1 was then moved to the Massey's test site in September 2022, and then scrapped in December 2023.\nHot Stage Load Head(HSLH) is a test article designed for verify the structural integrity of theinterstageof Super Heavy Boosters 9+.It was transported to the Massey's test site on July 30, 2023,before being loaded onto the Can Crusher testing device.In mid October 2023, it was moved back to the production site, presumably for scrapping.\n", "", ""], "info_kv": {"Manufacturer": "SpaceX", "Country of origin": "United States", "Used on": "SpaceX Starship", "Height": "71 m (233 ft)", "Diameter": "9 m (30 ft)", "Gross mass": "3,600 t (3,600,000 kg; 7,937,000 lb)", "Propellant mass": "3,400 t (3,400,000 kg; 7,496,000 lb)", "Empty mass": "200 t (200,000 kg; 441,000 lb)", "Status": "In development", "Total launches": "2", "Failed": "1 (IFT-1)", "Other": "Failed after staging (IFT-2)[1]", "First flight": "April 20, 2023 (IFT-1)", "Powered by": "33 Raptor engines", "Maximum thrust": "7,590 tf (74,400 kN; 16,700,000 lbf)", "Specific impulse": "327 s (3.21 km/s) (sea-level)", "Propellant": "Liquid oxygen / Methane"}, "reference": [["\"Stacking Diagrams\". ringwatchers.com.

few seconds before it landed back on the ground the hardware didnt get very high but it was the first time the test vehicle flew detached from the ground powered by spacexs nextgeneration rocket enginethe vehicle is a test prototype of spacexs future starship rocket starship is the companys most ambitious vehicle concept yet its a fully reusable design intended to send cargo and people to deep space destinations like the moon and mars similar to spacexs falcon 9 rockets starship is supposed to land upright  on earth or on distant worlds and then be able to take off againstarship still has a long way to go before it even gets to space let alone lands on another planet first spacex wants to validate the basic design of the vehicle as well as its newly developed main engine the raptor thats what this test was all about thanks to a single raptor engine mounted on its base the starship test vehicle briefly flew above spacexs facility in boca chica texas moved sideways and then landed upright these kinds of tests are often referred to as hops which is why this test vehicle was dubbed starhopper the whole test took about 15 seconds but it demonstrated the very basic launch and landing capability that starship will need in the future spacex first tried to do the flight on wednesday july 24th but had to abort right after igniting the engine spacex ceo elon musk said starhopper would fly up to 65 feet 20 meters high during this flight though he did not confirm if it reached that height once the test was complete live feeds of the test showed the starhopper covered in clouds making it difficult to see just how high it flew the raptor ignition also caused a large fire near the launch site after the test that burned for up to an hour afterward musk confirmed that the test was successful though the company will try another hop test in a week or two he says one that will fly more than 650 feet 200 meters upspacex has already ignited a raptor engine underneath starhopper a few times before though the rocket remained tethered to the ground for those tests so it only rose a few inches today marked starhoppers first free flight and it came just a week after the vehicle suffered a small failure last week the company ignited the engine underneath the vehicle in preparation for this hop test and the hardware briefly caught on fire due to a fuel leak however the rocket only sustained minimal damage according to spacex ceo elon musk ig advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel not bothered by a little heat he wrote on twittera shot of starhoppers ignition from a livestream by labpadreyoutube image labpadrespacex plans to fly this same vehicle on more hop tests in the months ahead but the company is already working on scaling things up spacex is currently building two starship prototypes that are meant to fly much higher than starhopper one in boca chica and another in cape canaveral florida those vehicles will be outfitted with three raptor engines musk says he claimed that one of the prototypes will hopefully reach an altitude of 12 miles 20 kilometers in the next few months musk has also hinted that hell give a more indepth presentation on the starship design later this month once the starship vehicles start flying the ceo has given two presentations on the vehicle  one in 2016 and one in 2017  but the design of starship has evolved in the months sincethe company is already working on scaling things upmusk recently claimed that the starship  super heavy system could perform its first uncrewed landing on the moon within the next two years followed by a crewed landing in four its an incredibly ambitious timeline especially since theres still quite a lot of work to be done the final starship design calls for six total raptor engines  three optimized for working best at sea level and three optimized for working best in the vacuum of space and the entire spacecraft is supposed to launch on top of a larger rocket booster known as the super heavy which has not been developed yet musk is also fairly notorious for giving unrealistic estimates for big projectsafter todays test spacex can boast that

with spacex ceo cto and founder elon musk this article includes key takeaways from the over twohourlong interview manufacturing musk once again emphasized that manufacturing is underrated and design is overrated developing a production system is 10100 times harder than designing the product which according to musk proved especially true with raptor furthermore as volume production increases the amount of effort that goes into design rounds down to 0 for example musk stated that designing a closedcycle engine is easy however the extremely hard part is getting the costpertonne of thrust under 1000  with each raptor producing 230 tonnes of thrust this means that each engine must cost less than 230000 to produce musk continued stating that the costpertonne to orbit and the costpertonne to the surface of mars is several orders of magnitude too high on current launch vehicles for this reason it is so important to move as much mass and complexity as possible to the ground systems which musk is calling stage 0 for example spacex has opted to not fuel starship through the booster and will rather move the complexity and mass to the ground and fuel starship from its side super heavy design musk noted that super heavys dry mass should be under 200 tonnes although the dry mass is a moving target the engines including mounting mass are 2 tonnes the fuel tank and the liquid oxygen lox tanks are roughly 80 tonnes and the interstage is around 20 tonnes including four grid fins that each weigh roughly 3 tonnes musk noted that he expects to be able to cut the mass of each grid fin in half and that the current design is very mass inefficient he further noted that currently everything is too heavy including avionics grid fins and batteries the grid fins are currently electrically powered using a modified tesla model 3 motor to drive them in continuation of using tesla parts the batteries are currently energy optimized instead of power optimized as a car needs several hours of energy whereas the grid fins only need two or three minutes of power due to these reasons musk noted like much of starships design the batteries are temporary and battery mass can drop by a factor of 10 the booster is designed to carry 3600 tonnes of propellant of which 78 of that is liquid oxygen the raptor burns at a mixture ratio of 35 to 37 which is fuel rich a fuel rich mixture burns cooler than the stoichiometric ratio which would melt the engine super heavys propellant residuals the amount of fuel that cannot be used without risking damage to the vehicle are on the order of 20 tonnes musk notes which is significantly higher than the 1 tonne propellant residual of the falcon 9 with optimizations to design musk noted that the final dry mass of super heavy should be between 160 and 200 tonnes an interesting note is the grid fins on super heavy do not fold in like on the falcon 9 as they are another mechanism which adds unnecessary complexity mass and failure modes additionally the increase in drag from the grid fins being deployed during ascent is small assuming they are not at a high angle of attack the grid fins on super heavy are not evenly spaced 90 apart like on the falcon 9 musk said the reason for this change is super heavy requires more pitch control authority so they positioned the gridfins closer together to increase pitch control the ch4 methane tank and interstage of booster 4 the two large circles at the top is where the grid fins are installed and the small arm between them is one of the load points for picking up the booster credit everyday astronaut musks engineering philosophy musk overviewed his five step engineering process which must be completed in order make the requirements less dumb the requirements are definitely dumb it does not matter who gave them to you he notes that its particularly dangerous if an intelligent person gives you the requirements as you may not question the requirements enough everyones wrong no matter who you are everyone is wrong some of the time he further notes that all designs are wrong its just a matter of how wrongtry very hard to delete the part or process if parts are not being added back into the design at least 10 of the time not enough parts are being deleted musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward lets add this part or process step in case we need it additionally each required part and process must come from a name not a department as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists but a person cansimplify and optimize the design this is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not existaccelerate cycle time musk states youre moving too slowly go faster but dont go faster until youve worked on the other three things firstautomate an important part of this is to remove inprocess testing after the problems have been diagnosed if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate there is no need for inprocess testing additionally musk restated that he believes everyone should be a chief engineer engineers need to understand the system at a high level to understand when they are making a bad optimization as an example musk noted that an order of magnitude more time has been spent reducing engine mass than reducing residual propellant despite both being equally as important the first grid fin being lifted onto b4 credit everyday astronaut raptor musk noted that spacex has produced parts of version 2 of raptor called raptor 2 including the thrust chamber assembly teams have finished the design of the turbo pumps and are expecting to be ready to fire the first raptor 2 by the end of august raptor 2 will reach 230 tonnes of thrust at 298 bar main combustion chamber pressure with musk commenting come on we have to get 2 more bar out of that thing raptor 2 features a larger throat which decreases the area ratio this causes a decrease in specific impulse of around 3 seconds but increases thrust significantly despite having a lower isp this allows for booster engines to be more efficient as it decreases gravity losses musk noted that raptor 2 will be significantly cleaner looking than raptor 1 as they will remove a large amount of plumbing raptor vacuum has a brazed steel tube wall nozzle extension that has an expansion ratio of around 80 giving the engine a specific impulse isp of 378 seconds musk noted that teams are hoping to get the expansion ratio up to 90 which would increase the isp to 380 seconds long term spacex will have three raptor variants sea level engine with gimbal sea level engine without gimbal and vacuum level engine without gimbal it was also stated that spacex will move volume production of raptor to mcgregor but keep the hawthorne factory for development engines and raptor vacuum versions starship separation system and attitude control following musks five step plan spacex has decided to remove the pushing separation system from starship and will instead rely on conservation of angular momentum to separate the stages right before main engine cutoff meco super heavy will gimbal its engines causing the vehicle to start rotating the latches between starship and super heavy will then release causing the vehicles to float apart the whole process is similar to how spacex deploys the starlink satellites this serves two purposes as it separates the stages while starting the boosters flip which it needs to conduct for the boost back burn in addition to this spacex has decided to remove the dedicated hot gas thrusters from super heavy to replace it spacex will use the ullage gas from the tanks for attitude control by having four vents spaced 90 apart by venting the tanks through these vents they will be able to control the attitude of the booster during the flip this has the advantage of using the ullage gas which would need to be vented either way to do useful work to the vehicle hls once again following musks five step process musk outlined that he is optimistic that hls will not need the landing thrusters at the top of the lunar starship if spacex is able to demonstrate that landing on the moon with raptor will not create too large of a hole in the lunar regolith they may remove the thrusters from the lunar starship while the exact raptor configuration for lunar starship has not been decided it is likely that itll be the same as the earth variant with three sealevel raptors and three vacuum raptors starship design philosophy musk noted that spacex has polar opposite design methods for starship and dragon he continued saying that dragon can never fail must be tested extreme amounts and has tons of margin however to develop the worlds first fully and rapidly reusable rocket spacex must iterate rapidly which leads to lots of failures falcon is inbetween where spacex can afford to have a landing failure but cannot experience a failure during ascent in response to dodd asking what spacex learned from the space shuttle musk continued stating that the biggest problem with the shuttle was that its design froze due to all space shuttle missions being crewed design changes were high risk and low reward musk contrasts stating the biggest advantage of starship is starship does not have anyone on board so we can blow things up its really helpful in response to this dodd asked if starship will ever have a launch escape system les musk explained that there are no plans to add les and that instead starship will fly a lot and have enough redundancy super heavy will be able to lose several engines during ascent while still having a fully successful mission and an engine on starship additionally musk stated that due to the inability to have an escape system on the moon and mars there is no reason to have one at all furthermore musk noted that spacexs goal is to push the envelope with each vehicle such that it blows up as this ensures spacex is getting lots of data while not having to store many vehicles he further noted that every starship has had major upgrades over the previous vehicle such is the pace at starbase because of this the first 10 starships that spacex gets back will likely not be reflown as newer vehicles will be so vastly different musk added that this is a freedom that spacex did not have with falcon 9 as it was flying cargo from day one however spacex had the grasshopper and f9r programs where they could test reusability technology version 1 of starships aft bulkhead with the vacuum raptor mounting ports credit everyday astronaut tps dodd asked musk how he was feeling about starships thermal protection system tps to which musk responded well find out he added that the tps tiles have been holding up well during the suborbital flight tests each tile is mechanically mounted in a way so that the tiles can move a small amount ensuring they do not get damaged during the expanding and contracting of the tank and tiles during the temperature changes of fueling and reentry starships tps tiles are currently made in florida at the bakery while not all of the tiles are uniform spacex is able to mass produce the tiles due to them largely being the same shape and size a significant advantage over the space shuttles tps system additionally musk described the tiles as having no meaningful limit to their lifespan musk stated that the hardest parts of the vehicle to protect against reentry heating are the flap hinges ensuring hot plasma does not get into the hinges and destroy the vehicle is not trivial as the seal must simultaneously not damage the tiles and survive the heat of reentry this means a metal seal is required with a full heatshield s20s dry mass will hopefully not be much more than 100 tonnes musk added that adding one tonne to the ship removes about two tonnes from the payload capacity after taking into account the added mass and increase in propellant needed workers installing tps on s20s nosecone credit everyday astronaut orbital demonstration flight musk stated that on the orbital demonstration flight s20 will reach orbital velocity but have a positive perigee that is less than 80km this will ensure the vehicle reenters safely in a controlled manner even in the event of a failure on the orbital flight both the first stage b4 and the second stage s20 will be expended as spacexs goal for the first flight is to make it to orbit without blowing up additionally spacex would like to demonstrate the ability to position the booster precisely such that if the booster came down next to the tower mechazilla the catching mechanism would be able to catch it for the first orbital flight spacex will use a crane to stack starship on top of super heavy while this is a harder way to stack the vehicles it allows spacex to start testing the vehicle before the orbital launch tower is complete musk noted that they will continue to launch from starbase texas as long as the operational difficulties remain low while starship is launching from texas spacex will continue to work on the two oil rigs named phobos and deimos however this is not a priority for spacex right now as spacex is just thinking about the things have to think about new nosecone musk noted that the new nosecone design consists of two rows of stretch formed steel whereas the old nosecone was

with spacex ceo cto and founder elon musk this article includes key takeaways from the over twohourlong interview manufacturing musk once again emphasized that manufacturing is underrated and design is overrated developing a production system is 10100 times harder than designing the product which according to musk proved especially true with raptor furthermore as volume production increases the amount of effort that goes into design rounds down to 0 for example musk stated that designing a closedcycle engine is easy however the extremely hard part is getting the costpertonne of thrust under 1000  with each raptor producing 230 tonnes of thrust this means that each engine must cost less than 230000 to produce musk continued stating that the costpertonne to orbit and the costpertonne to the surface of mars is several orders of magnitude too high on current launch vehicles for this reason it is so important to move as much mass and complexity as possible to the ground systems which musk is calling stage 0 for example spacex has opted to not fuel starship through the booster and will rather move the complexity and mass to the ground and fuel starship from its side super heavy design musk noted that super heavys dry mass should be under 200 tonnes although the dry mass is a moving target the engines including mounting mass are 2 tonnes the fuel tank and the liquid oxygen lox tanks are roughly 80 tonnes and the interstage is around 20 tonnes including four grid fins that each weigh roughly 3 tonnes musk noted that he expects to be able to cut the mass of each grid fin in half and that the current design is very mass inefficient he further noted that currently everything is too heavy including avionics grid fins and batteries the grid fins are currently electrically powered using a modified tesla model 3 motor to drive them in continuation of using tesla parts the batteries are currently energy optimized instead of power optimized as a car needs several hours of energy whereas the grid fins only need two or three minutes of power due to these reasons musk noted like much of starships design the batteries are temporary and battery mass can drop by a factor of 10 the booster is designed to carry 3600 tonnes of propellant of which 78 of that is liquid oxygen the raptor burns at a mixture ratio of 35 to 37 which is fuel rich a fuel rich mixture burns cooler than the stoichiometric ratio which would melt the engine super heavys propellant residuals the amount of fuel that cannot be used without risking damage to the vehicle are on the order of 20 tonnes musk notes which is significantly higher than the 1 tonne propellant residual of the falcon 9 with optimizations to design musk noted that the final dry mass of super heavy should be between 160 and 200 tonnes an interesting note is the grid fins on super heavy do not fold in like on the falcon 9 as they are another mechanism which adds unnecessary complexity mass and failure modes additionally the increase in drag from the grid fins being deployed during ascent is small assuming they are not at a high angle of attack the grid fins on super heavy are not evenly spaced 90 apart like on the falcon 9 musk said the reason for this change is super heavy requires more pitch control authority so they positioned the gridfins closer together to increase pitch control the ch4 methane tank and interstage of booster 4 the two large circles at the top is where the grid fins are installed and the small arm between them is one of the load points for picking up the booster credit everyday astronaut musks engineering philosophy musk overviewed his five step engineering process which must be completed in order make the requirements less dumb the requirements are definitely dumb it does not matter who gave them to you he notes that its particularly dangerous if an intelligent person gives you the requirements as you may not question the requirements enough everyones wrong no matter who you are everyone is wrong some of the time he further notes that all designs are wrong its just a matter of how wrongtry very hard to delete the part or process if parts are not being added back into the design at least 10 of the time not enough parts are being deleted musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward lets add this part or process step in case we need it additionally each required part and process must come from a name not a department as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists but a person cansimplify and optimize the design this is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not existaccelerate cycle time musk states youre moving too slowly go faster but dont go faster until youve worked on the other three things firstautomate an important part of this is to remove inprocess testing after the problems have been diagnosed if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate there is no need for inprocess testing additionally musk restated that he believes everyone should be a chief engineer engineers need to understand the system at a high level to understand when they are making a bad optimization as an example musk noted that an order of magnitude more time has been spent reducing engine mass than reducing residual propellant despite both being equally as important the first grid fin being lifted onto b4 credit everyday astronaut raptor musk noted that spacex has produced parts of version 2 of raptor called raptor 2 including the thrust chamber assembly teams have finished the design of the turbo pumps and are expecting to be ready to fire the first raptor 2 by the end of august raptor 2 will reach 230 tonnes of thrust at 298 bar main combustion chamber pressure with musk commenting come on we have to get 2 more bar out of that thing raptor 2 features a larger throat which decreases the area ratio this causes a decrease in specific impulse of around 3 seconds but increases thrust significantly despite having a lower isp this allows for booster engines to be more efficient as it decreases gravity losses musk noted that raptor 2 will be significantly cleaner looking than raptor 1 as they will remove a large amount of plumbing raptor vacuum has a brazed steel tube wall nozzle extension that has an expansion ratio of around 80 giving the engine a specific impulse isp of 378 seconds musk noted that teams are hoping to get the expansion ratio up to 90 which would increase the isp to 380 seconds long term spacex will have three raptor variants sea level engine with gimbal sea level engine without gimbal and vacuum level engine without gimbal it was also stated that spacex will move volume production of raptor to mcgregor but keep the hawthorne factory for development engines and raptor vacuum versions starship separation system and attitude control following musks five step plan spacex has decided to remove the pushing separation system from starship and will instead rely on conservation of angular momentum to separate the stages right before main engine cutoff meco super heavy will gimbal its engines causing the vehicle to start rotating the latches between starship and super heavy will then release causing the vehicles to float apart the whole process is similar to how spacex deploys the starlink satellites this serves two purposes as it separates the stages while starting the boosters flip which it needs to conduct for the boost back burn in addition to this spacex has decided to remove the dedicated hot gas thrusters from super heavy to replace it spacex will use the ullage gas from the tanks for attitude control by having four vents spaced 90 apart by venting the tanks through these vents they will be able to control the attitude of the booster during the flip this has the advantage of using the ullage gas which would need to be vented either way to do useful work to the vehicle hls once again following musks five step process musk outlined that he is optimistic that hls will not need the landing thrusters at the top of the lunar starship if spacex is able to demonstrate that landing on the moon with raptor will not create too large of a hole in the lunar regolith they may remove the thrusters from the lunar starship while the exact raptor configuration for lunar starship has not been decided it is likely that itll be the same as the earth variant with three sealevel raptors and three vacuum raptors starship design philosophy musk noted that spacex has polar opposite design methods for starship and dragon he continued saying that dragon can never fail must be tested extreme amounts and has tons of margin however to develop the worlds first fully and rapidly reusable rocket spacex must iterate rapidly which leads to lots of failures falcon is inbetween where spacex can afford to have a landing failure but cannot experience a failure during ascent in response to dodd asking what spacex learned from the space shuttle musk continued stating that the biggest problem with the shuttle was that its design froze due to all space shuttle missions being crewed design changes were high risk and low reward musk contrasts stating the biggest advantage of starship is starship does not have anyone on board so we can blow things up its really helpful in response to this dodd asked if starship will ever have a launch escape system les musk explained that there are no plans to add les and that instead starship will fly a lot and have enough redundancy super heavy will be able to lose several engines during ascent while still having a fully successful mission and an engine on starship additionally musk stated that due to the inability to have an escape system on the moon and mars there is no reason to have one at all furthermore musk noted that spacexs goal is to push the envelope with each vehicle such that it blows up as this ensures spacex is getting lots of data while not having to store many vehicles he further noted that every starship has had major upgrades over the previous vehicle such is the pace at starbase because of this the first 10 starships that spacex gets back will likely not be reflown as newer vehicles will be so vastly different musk added that this is a freedom that spacex did not have with falcon 9 as it was flying cargo from day one however spacex had the grasshopper and f9r programs where they could test reusability technology version 1 of starships aft bulkhead with the vacuum raptor mounting ports credit everyday astronaut tps dodd asked musk how he was feeling about starships thermal protection system tps to which musk responded well find out he added that the tps tiles have been holding up well during the suborbital flight tests each tile is mechanically mounted in a way so that the tiles can move a small amount ensuring they do not get damaged during the expanding and contracting of the tank and tiles during the temperature changes of fueling and reentry starships tps tiles are currently made in florida at the bakery while not all of the tiles are uniform spacex is able to mass produce the tiles due to them largely being the same shape and size a significant advantage over the space shuttles tps system additionally musk described the tiles as having no meaningful limit to their lifespan musk stated that the hardest parts of the vehicle to protect against reentry heating are the flap hinges ensuring hot plasma does not get into the hinges and destroy the vehicle is not trivial as the seal must simultaneously not damage the tiles and survive the heat of reentry this means a metal seal is required with a full heatshield s20s dry mass will hopefully not be much more than 100 tonnes musk added that adding one tonne to the ship removes about two tonnes from the payload capacity after taking into account the added mass and increase in propellant needed workers installing tps on s20s nosecone credit everyday astronaut orbital demonstration flight musk stated that on the orbital demonstration flight s20 will reach orbital velocity but have a positive perigee that is less than 80km this will ensure the vehicle reenters safely in a controlled manner even in the event of a failure on the orbital flight both the first stage b4 and the second stage s20 will be expended as spacexs goal for the first flight is to make it to orbit without blowing up additionally spacex would like to demonstrate the ability to position the booster precisely such that if the booster came down next to the tower mechazilla the catching mechanism would be able to catch it for the first orbital flight spacex will use a crane to stack starship on top of super heavy while this is a harder way to stack the vehicles it allows spacex to start testing the vehicle before the orbital launch tower is complete musk noted that they will continue to launch from starbase texas as long as the operational difficulties remain low while starship is launching from texas spacex will continue to work on the two oil rigs named phobos and deimos however this is not a priority for spacex right now as spacex is just thinking about the things have to think about new nosecone musk noted that the new nosecone design consists of two rows of stretch formed steel whereas the old nosecone was made from three sections of stamped sections the new nosecone is made by stretching steel over a big tool which creates a far smoother and cleaner final product musk also noted that spacex has stopped all work on the fairing door for now as it is not needed for an orbital demonstration flight in a similar manner spacex has not started work on starship inorbit refueling as its not needed in the short term the tip of the new nosecone design credit everyday astronaut spacexs urgency musk noted that they are moving extremely fast as if we operate with extreme urgency we have a chance of making life multiplanetary its still just a chance not for sure if we dont act with extreme urgency that chance is probably 0 shyamal patel the director of starship operations added to this stating that i tell the crane operators what would you do if there was an asteroid heading to this planet in 8 days closing words elon musk closed the interview stating he is glad that people are becoming interested in rockets and how they work he once again emphasized that becoming multiplanetary is very inspiring and may be the most inspiring thing musk hopes the starship program gives people confidence about the future and that humanity will have an exciting future in space he hopes that science fiction will become a reality some day like thislike loading elon muskraptorstarbasestarship author trevor

thursday but exploded midair before stage separation thursdays launch marked the vehicles historic first test flight as if the flight test was not exciting enough starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly before stage separation spacex tweeted the massive super heavy rocket booster which houses 33 engines lifted off and sent a massive boom across the coastal landscape as it fired to life the starship spacecraft riding atop the booster soared out over the gulf of mexico about 2½ minutes after takeoff the super heavy rocket booster was scheduled to expend most of its fuel and separate from the starship spacecraft leaving the booster to be discarded in the ocean the starship was meant to use its own engines blazing for more than six minutes to propel itself to nearly orbital speeds the flight reached its highest point 242 miles 39 kilometers above the ground and the explosion occurred about four minutes after liftoff according to spacex the vehicle experienced multiple engines out during the flight test lost altitude and began to tumble according to an update from spacex the flight termination system was commanded on both the booster and ship spacex said that teams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test the road and beach near the launchpad are expected to remain closed until friday spacexreuters an anomaly occurred during the ascent and prior to stage separation resulting in a loss of the vehicle no injuries or public property damage have been reported according to a statement thursday afternoon by the federal aviation administration the faa will oversee the mishap investigation of the starship  super heavy test mission a return to flight of the starship  super heavy vehicle is based on the faa determining that any system process or procedure related to the mishap does not affect public safety this is standard practice for all mishap investigations defining success for starship although it ended in an explosion thursdays test met several of the companys objectives for the vehicle clearing the launchpad was a major milestone for starship in the leadup to liftoff spacex ceo elon musk sought to temper expectations saying success is not what should be expected  that would be insane with a test like this success comes from what we learn and todays test will help us improve starships reliability as spacex seeks to make life multiplanetary spacex tweeted after the explosion musk congratulated team members on an exciting test launch in a postlaunch tweet and said they learned a lot for next test launch in a few months in a followup email to his employees musk added i dont want to jinx it but i think we are highly likely to reach orbit this year and recover the booster and ship if not this

from the faa to make another attempt but the company does not expect the process to be as laborious as securing the license for thursdays launch nasa administrator bill nelson took to twitter to share his congratulations on the flight test every great achievement throughout history has demanded some level of calculated risk because with great risk comes great reward looking forward to all that spacex learns to the next flight test  and beyond the test flight comes after years of explosive tests regulatory hurdles and public hyping from musk the company has been known to embrace fiery mishaps during the rocket development process spacex maintains that such accidents are the quickest and most efficient way of gathering data an approach that sets the company apart from its close partner nasa which prefers slow methodical testing over dramatic flareups musk has talked about starship  making elaborate presentations about its design and purpose  for years and he frequently harps on its potential for carrying cargo and humans to mars though nasa also plans to use the vehicle to put its astronauts on the moon hes even said that his sole purpose for founding spacex was to develop a vehicle like starship that could establish a human settlement on the red planet go nakamurareuters throngs of spectators lined local beaches to catch a glimpse of starships takeoff bringing

starship permeating the area a model starship in a front yard a rocket ranch camping ground filled with diehard enthusiasts and a billboard advertising martian beer whats next for starship the test flight is a small step in a sweeping project before starship can complete its first mission or host astronauts spacex has significant technological questions to hash out nasa has tapped spacex to provide a starship lunar lander that would ferry astronauts from a separate spacecraft down to the moons surface for the artemis iii mission which is scheduled as early as 2025 before that mission can take off however spacex has to prove that starship can make it to the moon  much less mars which is musks ultimate ambition the sheer mass of the vehicle will force the company to refuel the spacecraft while its still in earths orbit more than a dozen launches  carrying nothing but propellant  may be required to give a single starship lunar lander enough fuel to traverse the 238900mile 384500kilometer void between earth and the moon before spacex can even hash out that process itll also need to put starship into orbit in the first place thursdays test flight only sought to get to near orbital speeds and make a partial lap of the planet  an achievement that will have to wait for a future test even after flight tests begin to prove the vehicles design the starship spacecraft

spacex on what to do according to lisa hammond nasas associate program manager of the human landing system at johnson space center in houston in an interview earlier this month hammond did not share a specific checklist of tests or flights that nasa hopes to see before starship is entrusted with a moon landing mission i would not put it with a number she said adding that the artemis ii mission slated for next year will see humans fly atop the sls rocket after only one uncrewed test flight the confidence comes in the design the confidence comes in the safety of the vehicle for the crew hammond said in addition to the artemis iii mission starship already has some ambitious projects on its manifest spacex has sold a starshippropelled tourism trip around the moon to japanese billionaire yusaku maezawa the mission dubbed dear moon plans to fly maezawa and eight crewmates including various artists from around the world most of the dear moon crew was on the ground to witness starships first test flight karim iliya a photographer currently based in iceland described the experience of watching the flight attempt from a few miles away this wave of sound just smashed into my body and i could feel it and i could hear it and i thought am i really going inside that machine it was absolutely wild iliya told cnn it was just this feeling of joy and energy running through the crowd and through the people iliya added that the rocket explosion didnt give him any extra nerves for his future spaceflight he understood he was watching a prototype take flight but he experienced a feeling of intensity visiting the rocket shortly after mondays scrubbed launch attempt he said the dear moon crew was invited to get an upclose look at the rocket then the vehicle was still venting we heard this very loud sound many of us  i think  were ready to scramble iliya said thats when i realized how alive this machine is and how intense it is and will be when we actually strap ourselves in and leave the planet  which is in itself an absurd thought what to know about this rocket development of starship has been based at spacexs privately held spaceport about 40 minutes outside brownsville texas on the usmexico border testing began years ago with brief hop tests of early spacecraft prototypes the company started with brief flights that lifted a few dozen feet off the ground before evolving to highaltitude flights most of which resulted in dramatic explosions as the company attempted to land the prototypes upright one suborbital flight test in may 2021 however ended in success reginald mathalonenurphoassociated press since then spacex has also been working to get its super heavy booster prepared for flight the gargantuan 230foottall 69metertall cylinder is packed

behnken on spacexs first crew mission in 2020 launched and landed for the 19th and final time just before christmas then tipped over on its recovery ship during the trip back to cape canaveral florida ars reports this particular booster known by the tail number b1058 was special among spacexs fleet of reusable rockets it was the fleet leader having tallied 19 missions over the course of more than threeandahalf years more importantly it was the rocket that thundered into space on may 30 2020 on a flight that made history advertisement a museum piece  the lower third of the booster was still on the deck of spacexs recovery ship as it sailed into port canaveral on december 26 this portion of the rocket contains the nine merlin engines and landing legs some of which appeared mangled after the booster tipped over in high winds and waves hurley who commanded spacexs crew dragon spacecraft on the boosters historic first flight in 2020 said he hopes to see the remaining parts of the rocket in a museum hopefully they can do something because this is a little bit of an inauspicious way to end its flying career with half of it down at the bottom of the atlantic ocean said hurley spacex opens 2024 campaign with a new kind of starlink satellite spacex has launched the first six starlink satellites that will provide cellular transmissions for customers of tmobile and other carriers ars reports a falcon 9 rocket launched from california on january 2 carried 21 starlink satellites overall including the first six starlinks with direct to cell capabilities spacex says these satellites and thousands of others to follow will enable mobile network operators around the world to provide seamless global access to texting calling and browsing wherever you may be on land lakes or coastal waters without changing hardware or firmware tmobile said that field testing of starlink satellites with the tmobile network will begin soonthe enhanced starlink satellites have an advanced modem that acts as a cellphone tower in space eliminating dead zones with network integration similar to a standard roaming partner spacex said two of 144 spacex followed this launch with another falcon 9 flight from florida on january 3 carrying a swedish telecommunications satellite these were the companys first two missions of 2024 a year when spacex officials aim to launch up to 144 rockets an average of 12 per month exceeding the 98 rockets it launched in 2023 a big focus of spacexs 2024 launch manifest will be delivering these starlink direct to cell satellites into orbit submitted by ken the bin

booster and later wreckage next to a home life downrange  chinese government authorities reportedly issue warnings and evacuation notices for citizens living in regions where spent rocket boosters are likely to fall after launch but these videos clearly show people are still close by as the rockets fall from the sky weve seen this kind of imagery before including views of a rocket that crashed into

while its newest launch site is at a coastal location on hainan island allowing rockets launched there to drop boosters into the sea submitted by ken the bin and ellpeatea launch date set for next h3 test flight the second flight of japans new flagship h3 rocket is scheduled for february 14 us time february 15 in japan the japan aerospace exploration agency announced on december 28 this will come nearly one year after the first h3 test flight failed to reach orbit last march when the rockets second stage failed to ignite a few minutes after liftoff this failure destroyed a pricey japanese earth observation satellite and dealt a setback to japans rocket program the h3 is designed to be cheaper and more capable than the hiia and hiib rockets it will replace eventually the h3 will launch japans scientific research probes spy satellites and commercial payloads fixes since the first flight engineers narrowed the likely cause for the first h3 launch failure to an electrical issue although japanese officials have not provided an update on the investigation for several months in august japans space agency said investigators had narrowed the cause of the h3s secondstage malfunction to three possible failure scenarios nevertheless officials are apparently satisfied the h3 is ready to fly again but this time there wont be an expensive satellite aboard a dummy payload will fly inside the h3 rockets nose cone along with two relatively lowcost small satellites hitching a piggyback ride to orbit submitted by ken the bin and ellpeatea advertisement spacex sets new records to close out 2023 spacex launched two rockets three hours apart to wrap up a recordsetting 2023 launch campaign ars reports on december 28 spacex launched a falcon heavy rocket from nasas kennedy space center in florida with the us militarys supersecret x37b spaceplane less than three hours later a falcon 9 rocket took off a few miles to the south with another batch of starlink internet satellites these were spacexs final launches of 2023 spacex ended the year with 98 flights including 91 falcon 9s five falcon heavy rockets and two test launches of the giant new super heavystarship rocket these flights were spread across four launch pads in florida california and texas it was also the shortest turnaround between two spacex flights in the companys history and set a modernera record at cape canaveral florida with the shortest span between two orbitalclass launches there since 1966 wheres the x37bthe militarys reusable x37b spaceplane that launched on the falcon heavy rocket apparently headed into an unusually high orbit much higher than the spaceplane programs previous six flights but the military kept the exact orbit a secret and amateur skywatchers will be closely watching for signs of the spaceplane passing overhead in hopes of estimating its apogee perigee and inclination what the spaceplane is doing is also largely a mystery the x37b resembles a miniature version of nasas retired space shuttle orbiter with wings deployable landing gear and black thermal protection tiles to shield its belly from the scorching heat of reentry elon musk says spacex needs to built a lot of starships even with reusability spacex will need to build starships as often as boeing builds 737 jetliners in order to realize elon musks ambition for a mars settlement ars reportsto achieve mars colonization in roughly three decades we need ship production to be 100year but ideally rising to 300year musk wrote on his social media platform xspacex still aims to make the starship and its super heavy booster rapidly reusable the crux is that the ship the part that would travel into orbit and eventually to the moon or mars wont be reused as often as the booster these ships will come in a number of different configurations including crew and cargo transports refueling ships fuel depots and satellite deployers laws of physicsthe first stage of the giant launch vehicle named super heavy is designed toreturn to spacexs launch sites about six minutes after liftoff similar to the way spacex recovers its falcon boosters today theoretically musk wrote the booster could be ready for another flight in an hourwith the starship itself the laws of physics and the realities of geography come into playas an object flies in lowearth orbit the earth rotates underneath it this means that a satellite or starship will find itself offset some 225 degrees in longitude from its launch site after a single 90minute orbit around the planet it could take several hours or up to a day for a starship in lowearth orbit to line up with one of the recovery sites the ship needs to complete at least one orbit but often several to have the ground track line back up with the launch site so reuse may only be daily musk wrote this means that ship production needs to be roughly an order of magnitude higher than booster production next three launches january 5 kuaizhou 1a
