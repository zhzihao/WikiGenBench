Based on true events, it focuses on Robert Berchtold, who in the 1970s twice sexually abused and kidnapped Jan Broberg. The show stars Jake Lacy as Berchtold, and Hendrix Yancey and Mckenna Grace as Broberg at different ages. Colin Hanks, Lio Tipton, and Anna Paquin appear in supporting roles.\n\nNick Antosca created A Friend of a Family after reading Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story (2003) and watching Abducted in Plain Sight (2017), both of which discuss Broberg's kidnappings. Antosca thought Broberg's story was too intricate for Abducted in Plain Sight 90-minute runtime and sought to retell the events with more context and depth. Broberg and her mother Mary Ann served as producers on the show; Jan Broberg was often invited to give the writers suggestions. Episodes were recorded between February and August 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia; and Los Angeles, California. The series was released between October 6 and November 10, 2022, on the streaming service Peacock. Critics gave A Friend of the Family positive reviews, and praised Eliza Hittman's direction and Lacy's performance.\n\nPlot\nIn 1974, Robert Berchtold, a close friend of the Broberg family, kidnaps 12-year-old Jan Broberg. After Broberg is returned to her parents, he again abducts her at age 14 in 1976.\n\nCast and characters\n\nMain\n\n Jake Lacy as Robert Berchtold\n Colin Hanks as Bob Broberg\n Lio Tipton as Gail Berchtold\n Mckenna Grace as Jan Broberg\n Hendrix Yancey portrays young Jan Broberg\n Anna Paquin as Mary Ann Broberg\n\nRecurring\n Austin Stowell as FBI Agent Peter Walsh\n Patrick Fischler as Garth Pincock\n Philip Ettinger as Joe Berchtold\n Maggie Sonnier as Karen Broberg\n Mila Harris portrays young Karen Broberg\n Norah Murphy as Susan Broberg\n Elle Lisic portrays young Susan Broberg\n Tyler Wojton as Joel Berchtold\n Bree Elrod as Jennifer Ferguson\n Ella Jay Basco as Sofia\n Callie Johnson as Cop #4\n Kate Adams as Eileen\n Keilah Davies as Young Caroline Hansen\n Jan Broberg as Jan's psychologist\n\nEpisodes\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nRobert Berchtold, a close family friend, kidnapped and sexually assaulted Jan Broberg at ages 12 and 14. Jan and her mother Mary Ann Broberg wrote a memoir titled Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story (2003) about these events. In 2017, Broberg told her story in the television documentary Abducted in Plain Sight. After watching the documentary, Nick Antosca \"couldn't stop thinking about it\" and considered Broberg's family fascinating. He later read Stolen Innocence, which he said \"was relatable in that we all have vulnerabilities that somebody can use against us\". Despite admiring Abducted in Plain Sight, Antosca thought the story was too intricate for an 90-minute runtime; he wanted to work with Broberg and her family to retell the events with more context and depth. Antosca and his colleagues studied many trial transcripts, FBI notes, interviews, and childhood journals about the case. In May 2020, it was announced Universal Content Productions was developing a series about Broberg's kidnappings; Antosca was to write and executive produce the series under his banner Eat the Cat, and Jan and Mary Ann Broberg would serve as producers.\n\nJan received several offers to tell her story in a feature film, television film, or miniseries but she thought the pitches were \"too slick\" and asked questions like \"How did you ever forgive your parents?\" that lacked understanding about her family's experiences. In March 2019, Antosca and Alex Hedlund contacted her about the project; she said he distinguished himself from other filmmakers in wanting to tell her story in his \"sincerely empathetic\" approach, saying, \"There was care and concern ... So I was like, 'I think they get it. \n\nAntosca stated he did not want to tell Broberg's story unless it benefited her family. In A Friend of the Family, he wanted to explain her parents' actions and choices, which he deemed only possible with her assistance. The Brobergs hoped to show would help people recognize grooming, coercion, and manipulation. The writers often invited Jan to give detailed suggestions. According to Antosca, she was vital to the \"human story\" depicted in the series, which is more immersive, empathetic, and relatable for the viewer. Broberg stated she has told her story many times \"because I want to help people see it before it's too late\", and abuse from \"someone you know, someone you often love and usually trust\" is common but not discussed enough.\n\nThe show's nine-episode duration allowed for more subtle and relatable story-telling than that of Abducted in Plain Sight. Antosca thought the story is \"about a family overcoming something and getting to a place of forgiveness and healing where the monster has lost his power over them, which is also what made it worth telling\". He classed the series as psychological horror. From the show's conception, he knew it would not include anything \"exploitative or potentially gratuitous or uncomfortable\". Antosca said viewers should be able to process each part of the story without being overwhelmed by anything that felt exploitative. He said A Friend of the Family should not show any of Broberg's abuse as a teenager, believing it would not serve the series' purpose. At the start of the show, Broberg introduces herself and explains her story to assure viewers she survives and because the events depicted are \"nearly unbelievable, unless someone says, 'This happened.\n\nIn February 2022, the streaming platform Peacock gave the show a straight-to-series order with Eliza Hittman as director and executive producer. Hittman had never heard about Broberg's story before receiving the script for A Friend of the Family but she admired the show's writing, characters, and world so much she \"devoured\" its script. Her direction was not influenced by Abducted in Plain Sight due to the large number of omissions and limited duration. Since Abducted in Plain Sight production, true crime dramas had gained in popularity, prompting Hittman to contemplate the genre's ethics. Broberg was serving as producer, which Hittman described as a rare occasion in which the victim had granted consent. According to Antosca, Hittman was a key part of the \"delicate psychological emotional character moments\".\n\nCasting\nVanity Fair said A Friend of the Family was barely a \"dutiful retelling\". Broberg anticipated the cast would go on \"their own emotional journey\" and develop their own understanding of their characters. She knew they did not want to mimic her family. Broberg addressed letters to the main cast, assuring them she would not hinder any decisions or interpretations they made. She also wanted the actors to understand every character—including Berchtold—was a \"full human being\".\n\nAlthough she was not involved in the final casting selections, Broberg extensively spoke to Antosca about Robert Berchtold's character and the importance of portraying him as credible, loving parent. Jake Lacy was cast as Robert Berchtold; Lacy was initially apprehensive about the role but Broberg's involvement and commitment persuaded him. Lacy was drawn to the show's nuanced presentation of the events, which showed the Broberg family as human beings rather than as victims of a sensational crime. To prepare for his role, Lacy read Lolita (1955), a novel in which the middle-aged narrator abducts and sexually abuses a 12-year-old girl with whom he is obsessed. \n\nLacy thought emulating Berchtold's mindset was unnecessary, unhealthy, and useless. He imagined Berchtold's kidnappings and sexual motivations as a heist and took inspiration from Ocean's Eleven character Danny Ocean and American actor Steve McQueen:, saying, \"He wants to be the dangerous, cool, edgy guy in this LDS community in Pocatello, Idaho ... I leaned into a lot of that ego and assumed charisma, assumed charm and fearlessness\". Antosca gave Lacy a number of Jan and Mary Ann's personal possessions, including FBI recordings of telephone calls between the Brobergs and Berchtold after Jan's second kidnapping, in which he pretends not to know her location. Lacy was hesitant about becoming close to Jan Broberg because he feared he would be unable to portray Berchtold's inhumanity and obsessiveness. Broberg met Lacy during the second episode's production; according to Lacy, meeting Broberg \"helped settle the work more than shake it up because you get to see the person you're doing this for\".\n\nPrior to receiving the script for A Friend of the Family, Colin Hanks had not heard Broberg's story; he almost declined the role of Bob Broberg, not wanting to play \"a super nice Mormon that goes through a bunch of stuff\". Hanks watched Abducted in Plain Sight after reading the first three screenplays. He could not stop thinking about the Brobergs' story and discussed it with many people. After two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hanks challenged himself to work on projects that scared him. He said he \"really looked at [A Friend of the Family] story as that challenge, and ... just jumped off the cliff and got to work\". Hanks found Bob was a difficult character to portray, saying he had no similarities to the character and that he was \"so petrified\". Jan told Hanks Bob often said \"every day is a bonus\", which significantly enhanced Hanks's portrayal: he said, \"That was such an important thing that I came back to quite a bit, because no matter what is happening, ... to still have that point of view—even on the darkest of days—that every day is a bonus, that was so helpful\".\n\nLio Tipton, who portrays Gail Berchtold, was interested in the show due to the Brobergs' involvement, and was also a fan of Antosca and Hittman. Of the main cast, the least was known about Gail and there was nothing clear about her position. Tipton often met with Hittman to discuss this; Tipton wanted to focus on how hard Gail worked to keep her family secure and together. Tipton attempted to focus on the interactions with Lacy's character and tried to avoid taking sides during their performance.\n\nHendrix Yancey and Mckenna Grace portray younger and older versions of Jan Broberg, respectively. Antosca was insistent on not casting adult actors who looked young for the role. Grace studied Broberg's story in depth, reading Stolen Innocence, court documents, diary entries, and letters between Broberg and Berchtold. While filming, Grace tried to spend as much time as she could with Yancey. and copied her mannerisms and smile. Grace also worked alongside Broberg. Despite enjoying freedom as an actor, Grace wanted to connect with Broberg and understand as much as she could about her thoughts and feelings at the time. Broberg and Grace discussed subtle gestures such an nail-biting to show stress. Grace described the role as \"really emotionally and sometimes physically exhausting\"; she had to push her abilities and blend three versions of Broberg—her own, Yancey's, and the real-life Broberg.\n\nThe show also stars Anna Paquin as Mary Ann Broberg, Jan's mother. The recurring cast includes Austin Stowell as FBI Agent Peter Walsh, who is determined to return Jan to her family; Patrick Fischler as Garth Pincock, Bannock County's district attorney; Bree Elrod as Jennifer Ferguson, Berchtold's lawyer; Philip Ettinger as Joe Berchtold, Robert's brother; and Ella Jay Basco as Sofia. In the show's final episode, Jan Broberg makes a cameo as Dr. Carr, a therapist who worked with her family. Broberg had previously worked as an actor and loved the profession. She considered her appearance in A Friend of the Family freeing; she said she felt she was \"able to give [her] younger self a path\" and console her father, who she thought never truly forgave himself.\n\nFilming and design\nA Friend of the Family was primarily filmed in the Atlanta metropolitan area and some scenes were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Principal photography took place from February to August 2022. While filming the scene in which Berchtold drugs Broberg, the crew focused on ensuring the then 11-year-old Yancey felt safe; according to Antosca, \"You're asking a very young actress to go to a really intense emotional place. So I was very scared by getting that right, giving her what she needed to do her best work but protecting her\". The show depicts the Broberg family's normal life, including birthdays, church visits, and vacations. The design takes inspiration from Classical Realism films of the 1970s, including Badlands (1973) and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974). Production designer John D. Kretschmer was influenced by his own Protestant home in North Carolina, which he deemed similar to Broberg's neighborhood. The production team recreated the Broberg family's house in Atlanta: they renovated a home atop a hill that was \"a surprising visual match\" by replicating the windows and floor plan. There was not much information available about Berchtold's house but Kretschmer knew he was wealthy, and owned a piano and a plethora of games. The team used police reports to model the GMC 260 automobile he drove. Yancey and Grace wore some of Broberg's clothes from the period. In the final episode, Grace wears a reproduction of a dress jan Broberg wore in a photograph.\n\nRelease\nA Friend of the Family first four episodes were made available on the Peacock on October 6, 2022. The final five episodes were released weekly from October 13 to November 10.\n\nReception\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 92% approval rating for A Friend of the Family with an average rating of 7.8/10 based on 24 critical reviews. The website's critics' consensus reads; \"Unspooling like a slow-motion nightmare, A Friend of the Family benefits immeasurably from Eliza Hittman's deft direction and Jake Lacy's unflinching portrayal of insidious evil\". Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 73 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nJournalists praised the show's portrayal of the true-crime genre. According to Slant Magazine, A Friend of the Family is able to \"sidestep some common true-crime pitfalls\" by focusing on the psychological effects rather than sexual abuse, and IndieWire writer Steve Greene said the series \"has little concern for true-crime expectations\". According to The Hollywood Reporter, A Friend of the Family mostly consists of \"self-justification\" for the Broberg family. Hittman's direction was well-received by critics. Greene said the show puts the viewer directly in Jan's shoes. Chase Hutchinson, from Collider, agreed, describing the direction as \"understated yet no less upsetting\". Several reviewers commented on the show's duration. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Michael Hogan called the show \"unnecessarily bloated\". Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly said the show has difficulty sustaining its nine-hour duration due to a lack of insight and analysis. The A.V. Club Saloni Gajjar stated nine episodes were warranted and called the show \"compelling\".\n\nCritics praised Lacy's performance. TheWrap stated his performance on the show \"lives and dies\", and is deserving of an Emmy Award nomination. The Financial Times called him the show's highlight. According to IGN, Lacy conveys a sense of villainy simply by smiling widely and speaking softly. The rest of the cast also received praise: reviewers from MovieWeb and The A.V. Club referred to Paquin as \"heartbreaking\" and \"quietly powerful\", respectively, while Common Sense Media stated Tipton \"gives ... Gail real depth, convincingly depicting a troubled woman frozen between shame\". According to Variety Joshua Alston, Tipton is able to give the character stability while maintaining a jittery, disturbing quality that is reminiscent of Lili Taylor. According to Baldwin, Yancey's and Grace's performances both have genuine warmth and vulnerability, and Hogan described Yancey as \"heartbreakingly vulnerable\". Entertainment website Ready Steady Cut dubbed Yancey and Grace the show's \"MVPs\", saying they \"manage to fully convince and convey that they are in fact the one character at differing ages\". RogerEbert.com Brain Tallerico, however, said the show is less coherent with two actors playing Jan; he stated he would prefer only Grace portraying the character. MovieWeb deemed Hanks' performance his finest yet but The Hollywood Reporter labeled him a \"weak link\".\n\nA Friend of the Family: True Evil\nOn November 15, 2022, Peacock released the documentary film A Friend of the Family: True Evil. It follows Jan Broberg's recovery as she revisits several places, including the bedroom where her sexual assaults began. It also includes the story of another victim of Berchtold. The documentary explores ways families deal with generational trauma, which can affect survivors and their loved ones years after the abuse occurred, through interviews with Jan Broberg, her mother and son, and other family members.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2020s American drama television miniseries\n2022 American television series debuts\n2022 American television series endings\nChild abduction in television\nEnglish-language television shows\nPeacock (streaming service) original programming\nPsychological horror\nTelevision series by Universal Content Productions\nTrue crime television series", "unikey": "A Friend of the Family (miniseries)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Plot", "Cast_and_characters", "Episodes", "Production", "Release", "Reception", "A_Friend_of_the_Family:_True_Evil", "Notes", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["In 1974, Robert Berchtold, a close friend of the Broberg family, kidnaps 12-year-oldJan Broberg.

a secret sexual obsession with the brobergs eldest daughter prepubescent jan hendrix yanceymckenna grace despite his charming charismatic goodytwoshoes persona b can only keep his infatuation hidden for so long based on the grisly true story that yielded the popular 2017 netflix documentary abducted in plain sight a friend of the family sees bs fixation on jan spiral out of control resulting in a whirlwind of abuse deception delusion and trickery over the course of multiple years and nine remarkably tense episodes a family matter if a friend has anything going for it its its strangerthanfiction story which is notable particularly for its unfettered unpredictability while a majority of truecrime stories that yield onscreen adaptations follow a mostly predictable format  bad guy comes into town bad guy does some bad stuff good guy tries to stop the bad guy  a friend takes the format to which audiences have grown so accustomed and turns it on its head advertisement

most of this actually happened of course bob and mary anns transgressions will be better experienced by the viewer firsthand but to offer a taste of whats to come the couple waits for over two days before reporting jan missing after b snatches her from under their roof and spoiler alert their behavior only gets more bizarre from that point onward performances to remember bob and mary anns actions are so outlandish at times that they require the actors to stick the landing on their performances or else the story would be in danger of slipping from the realm of the shocking to the realm

print this page share on whatsapp after cocreating emmywinning series the act this years candy and now creating a friend of the family its easy to label nick antosca the highbrow king of true crime streaming series yet the acclaimed showrunner quickly corrected labeling a friend of the family as part of the trendy true crime genre i dont think the stories that i like to do are true crime antosca exclusively told indiewire i think of them in terms of human stories and psychological horror stories so i dont see it as whats the next true crime story that we can tell a friend of the family centers on the broberg clan led by husband and wife bob colin hanks and mary ann anna paquin broberg nextdoor neighbor brother b berchtold jake lacy takes a special interest in their tween daughter jan played across the series by hendrix yancey and mckenna grace respectively and seduces the whole family in a yearslong ploy to make jan his child bride antosca closely worked with fellow executive producer jan broberg the reallife survivor of childhood sexual abuse grooming and kidnapping antosca previously said the limited series exists outside the typical categories of genre likening it to a hitchcockian thriller built around obsessive relationships a family drama and a nightmarish comingofage story with surreal elements that are stranger than fiction despite dramatizing the true stories of respective killers gypsy rose blanchard and candy montgomery for hulu antosca noted that he is not inherently interested in true crime as a genre adding but i am interested in true stories i understand the conversation going on about true crime now but youre telling true human stories and what is more interesting and what gets closer to the heart of what we tell stories for in the first place which is hopefully to understand and empathize with other versions of the human experience and the questions of exploitation are very legitimate and something you have to keep in view antosca said but the volume of superhero movies i think bothers me as a writer and an audience member more than the number of true stories being dramatized just from a writing point of view i see so much richness in telling true stories about human beings when you do that its very very important to do that responsibly a friend of the familypeacock lead lacy recalled antosca telling the cast that if jan broberg and mary ann broberg were not involved as executive producers on the series a friend of the family would never be made antosca was also adamant about not showing any of the abuse jan endured as a teenager i think he was like i have no interest narratively creatively as a human to create that it doesnt serve our purpose of what the story is lacy said at the series premiere at new york citys metrograph to indiewire antosca confirmed going into the idea of the show and the possibility of making the show we always knew that we were not going to show anything onscreen or actually do anything that would feel exploitative or potentially gratuitous or uncomfortable so we knew that the experience of making the show and the experience of watching the show needed to be one that would allow you to emotionally and intellectually process the enormity of what happened and all the different levels of the experience without being overwhelmed by anything that felt exploitative this particular true story cant and shouldnt be properly told without the participation and blessing of the people it happened to antosca detailed the importance of working with survivors when telling true stories while adding its a rule of thumb on a casebycase basis amid backlash to fellow true crimelabeled series like the thing about pam and ryan murphys dahmer a friend of the familypeacock i dont think truman capote needed the clutter familys permission to tell that story with the surviving relatives but i do think in specific cases and the brobergs story is one of them because there is a surviving victim who is 100 percent a victim shes alive shes an actress it just seemed very clear in this case that you shouldnt tell this story unless its going to be a positive thing for her and her family antosca said it really depends on the case itself if something happened 50 years ago and there are some relativespeople are entitled to their experiences and their opinions but i do think its a casebycase basis jan broberg also introduces the series in the first episode the berchtold family declined to participate in the previous netflix documentary about the events antosca said he respects their privacy regarding the peacock adaptation i imagine that it was a very difficult and painful situation for them i dont want to speak for them he added mental health specialist kim whyte who previously worked on amazon prime video series the underground railroad was available for the cast and crew of a friend of the family throughout production actor lio tipton who plays brother bs wife gail told indiewire that there was a sacred heaviness on set when bringing this true story to life jan broberg was in the writers room and wrote letters to cast members about her experiences with each person the cast portrayed a friend of the familypeacock tipton told indiewire that they never felt like it was a true crime story while filming a friend of the family tipton also recently starred in bj novaks vengeance a takedown of desensitized true crime trends in pop culture i associate true crime much more with how it did in vengeance as a podcast as something that you talk about with your friends over dinner and desensitization is a big part of it tipton who identifies as nonbinary and uses theythem pronouns said i associate that with true crime with almost something distant and fictionalized obviously its not but a friend of the family ive never been able to put in that box because this isnt about a whodunnit or trying to find the justice behind something its much deeper than that its much more personal than that tipton shared that the broberg familys involvement in the series proved to be a turning point in the true crime genre as a whole under antoscas guidance this ending is positive because jan is behind it there is light that is the message i think that is very very succinctly different tipton said this ending is not meant to cause this outrage or debate its hard to even discuss with friends you cant be that casual with it but it does open up a discussion and place for people with similar experiences because no matter what no matter how out there this story seems its grounded in something very real and very sensitive for many individuals not just this distant crime read more a friend of the family jake lacy lio tipton nick antosca peacock daily

psychological thriller on island time tv review 9 months ago fxs dear mama is a poignant passionate portrait of tupac and afeni shakur from director allen hughes tv review 9 months ago see all fernando decillispeacock a friend of the family is written with an acute awareness of the backlash that met the brobergs after they shared how they were manipulated and nearly destroyed by a malignant narcissist it begins with a statement from the brobergs daughter jan the primary victim in the story who serves as a producer on family along with mary ann i know it may seem unbelievable but we lived in a different world back then jan says im telling my familys story today because so many people believe it could never happen to them as compelling and frightening as family can be it never quite makes the case that what happened to the brobergs could happen to anyone family creator nick antosca who previously dramatized weirderthanfiction crimes in the act and candy certainly seems to think they do the series is brimming with empathy for what the family went through and seems expressly designed to acquit some of bob and mary anns more baffling decisions to its credit family often does a better job of illuminating their thought processes than they did themselves in abducted in plain sight the berchtold saga is so lengthy and complex that a 91minute documentary didnt leave enough room for it to breathe not to mention the story is told by the brobergs who recount it all with the affectless tone of trauma survivors who have fought hard just to view the events through an objective lens naturally a story so hard to comprehend can only be sold through stellar performances and family is crammed full of them hanks and paquin are terrific as always and imbue the brobergs with a fierceness their reallife counterparts only gained through this experience as for jan her role is split between hendrix yancey absolutely stunning here as the younger version and the promising mckenna grace as the older version of familys true protagonist but most surprising is jake lacy who toplines as berchtold and is frightening enough to obliterate whatever memory of him playing affable sweethearts remains after his heel turn in the white lotus watching lacy reenact the storys most shocking moments drives home just how far berchtold was willing to go to surgically remove jan from her family second only to lacy in the breakthrough performance category is lio tipton who stars as berchtolds wife gail tipton arguably has the heaviest lift given that gail was equal parts victim and enabler of her husband and her complicated psychology wasnt fully explored in the documentary tipton manages to anchor the character and lend her a twitchy unsettling quality reminiscent of lili taylor the writing is also strong especially in an episode that shows berchtolds insidious methods for turning the broberg children against their father but as is often the case with scripted series adapted from truecrime documentaries much of what makes the story inscrutable remains so at least in the six episodes provided to critics one piece of the puzzle chief among the wtf were you thinking broberg decisions is folded into family so subtly that the audience might not even pick up on it without prior knowledge of the events if antosca is trying to avoid the same victimblaming that followed the documentary its a noble goal but in insisting that the brobergs are like any other family the show sacrifices the opportunity to explore why this family in particular made such a ripe target for berchtold family certainly sheds some light on how such an awful thing could happen but with the light only comes more shadows trending tv comments most popular oppenheimer leads critics

the very genesis of this project we had known that we werent going to depict sexual abuse on screen because this series is about what people didnt see how they didnt see and how it happened despite everybody who is there the closest that we come to a moment like that is in a flashback its all implied but theres just a moment we shot it without the kid actor present but theres just a hint of a memory a pov flashback its not explicit at all but its just an out of focus unnerving just a hint of a suggestion i was shooting that with lauren wolkstein whos directing the finale and even though

barely bothering with his line readings drops in as a decorated general and myers and michael shannon are suitably surreal as a pair of eccentric intelligence agents chewing their little bits of scenery into a fine pulp theres an unexpected pleasure in hearing malek roll the words graham cracker across his tongue and the production and costume design are impeccable but the resolution of the central mystery is both rushed and obtuse and it all unfolds in a frenetic flailing whirl of pomp and nonsense that amsterdams strange circuitous journey and almost embarrassing surplus of stars never

mercurial canvases for the director not just beautiful blanks dean died suddenly last month at 32 which adds a strange bittersweet postscript to her presence here östlunds sense of irony can sometimes veer toward the obvious or flatfooted his targets  the selfregarding follies of the uberrich the inanity of social media beauty as currency  are so broad and shiny that the occasional dip feels almost

of examining the brobergs to determine what may have led them to be so susceptible to brother bs sinister machinations its understandable why the real jan broberg continues to tell her story she previously participated in the 2017 documentary abducted in plain sight but what does antosca want us to know theres a vague nod to the patriarchal read sexist structure of the mormon church perhaps to imply that both mary ann and jan were conditioned to obey a trusted male friend thats certainly not enough insight to sustain nine episodes of television but in this era of truecrime awards bait

thriller limited series a friend of the family based on true events but as the nick antoscacreated show proves sometimes truth really is stranger than fiction actor tipton who identifies as nonbinary and uses theythem pronouns portrays latter day saints housewife gail berchtold who seems to have the perfect life a handsome husband jake lacy five adorable children and kind neighbors the brobergs colin hanks and anna paquin yet when gails spouse bob brother b grooms and repeatedly kidnaps the young jan broberg hendrix yancey and mckenna grace respectively gails own abusive relationship with bob comes to light it was really hard there is nothing decisive in where she stands tipton said of gail the person i was representing in a big way was the most fictional representation of any of the characters because of that i tried to hone in on my relationship with jake s character i never even saw a photo of gail but one of the most important things for me was to make sure i got how she thinks to be honest it was very very scary for me having such a personal relationship with the character in a big way tipton said of taking on the role playing music was one of the most helpful things that i did because i could not find compassion for this person and because i couldnt find compassion for  i didnt want to be on his side at all tipton continued for the story because of legal reasons gail cant know a lot she has to kind of stay in that gray zone and it was really really difficult for me to do without having compassion i just kind of hated everything i was saying if it meant protecting jakes character i put it as im going to assume gail is intelligent and because im assuming that gail is intelligent shes not ignorant and because shes not ignorant what would keep her in this situation a friend of the familyfernando decillispeacock they said and i just kept going back to her kids and needing b to be happy so that my kids could be happy because when he was stable and happy and got what he wanted the family was ok i focused on the fear gail had and how much i just needed their father home because my boys miss him and whatnot which allowed me to get in touch with a different side because there is a desperation and so just the desire to please him which is also at that time not too uncommon with the social expectations of women and wives especially in the lds community it has very specific gender roles tipton added i never thought gail was doing this because she thought anything bad would happen or that he would use this against them at all i think that she really was ultimately trying to bring peace to the family and act a bit i think she had multiple masks to put on to survive i think a lot of people in abusive situations do that in a regular basis and may or may not know that i dont think thats ignorant at all i think thats a matter of circumstance a friend of the familyerika dosspeacock tiptons starmaking performance as a torn gail who toes the line between trying to keep her family together and proving her sexual worth to an unstable brother b carries the weight of every word onscreen in episode 3 gail tells b that mary ann broberg paquin has certain intimacy issues with her spouse hanks seemingly providing personal details that brother b could manipulate and weaponize when grooming the broberg family as a whole that scene was really really hard the dinner scene telling b all about what i had learned because of that reason that it felt like i was trying to help him tipton said  eliza hittman and i we worked to figure out part of being in an emotionally unstable abusive relationship is this cycle of dependency and how we learn to trust and love someone who holds the keys to everything thats beautiful and happy just a little out of reach and its this constant trying to be better so that you can live up to his expectations what she has put on a pedestal because thats one of the cycles of abuse a friend of the familyerika dosspeacock as showrunner antosca exclusively told indiewire never rarely always sometimes helmer hittman was critical in building out the delicate psychological emotional character moments with both the pilot and episode 3 serving as two different introductions to the broberg family the first sans brother b and the third charting brother bs targeted mark on the family dramatizing the events of the 1970s hitchcockian thriller endured by the brobergs and the berchtolds was a sacred practice for tipton with both antosca and hittman at the helm i honestly now dont know how to describe it everyone turned something on and nobody carried things like that offset because how could we tipton said there is no way to sit in that mentality and to really plug yourself with images that your acting brain has to put together that you cant help but feel and think that was part of the magic when we were doing scenes when we were all in costume and it was time to film there was just this heaviness that you could feel around the room it was sacred almost and then we would step off set and i think we would remember that this is our story tipton shared that they found comfort in scenes opposite costar paquin as part of a secret little shared experience with both of their characters adult survivors of brother bs abuse i think abuse in general is a very shared relationship tipton said i really relied on anna with our bond and it all goes back to the brobergs themselves with both jan and the reallife mary ann on set as well i dont think any of us could have done it without jan being our northern light to guide us tipton said this was not a project that any of us could take home easily a friend of the family is now streaming on peacock read more a friend

the story of her strangerthanfiction kidnapping in the 2017 documentary abducted in plain sight she did not anticipate the charged response it would elicit her saga was admittedly complicated when she was 12 and living in idaho in the 1970s a close family friend and neighbor who was decades older bob berchtold drove off with her one day having told brobergs parents he was taking the child horseback riding berchtold managed to keep her captive with an elaborate ruseclaiming they had been abducted by aliens and that jan needed to cooperate with the aliens ie his demands if she wanted her family to stay safebut berchtold did not just kidnap broberg oncehe entrapped brobergs religious parents in such an elaborate web of trust and shame that he managed to convince the family to drop the most serious charges against him continue letting him spend time with their young daughter andin the most shocking twist of allkidnap her a second time when she was 14the skye borgmandirected documentary condensed this tale into 91 minutes some viewers hit the roof wondering how any parent could let their kid be taken by the same person twice in an interview with vf broberg says that she felt afterward as though she had allowed my parents legacy to be soiled or something it was so shockingly hard for me i didnt know people wouldnt get it many people did its something that happened to them or someone close to themthey had been groomed or conned or manipulated and could relate but a lot of people just didntso broberg was thrilled to help reframe her and her parents story in peacocks new limited series a friend of the family which was created by nick antosca the act and candy and invited broberg and her mother mary ann to act as producers the nineepisode series which premiered this week retells the sagathis time making it clear how a family like the brobergs could have let berchtold plus his wife and young children into their lives and continue to give the neighbor second chances berchtold played by jake lacy did not just target jan hendrix yancey and mckenna grace the series makes clear he also ensnared her parents anna paquin and colin hanks seducing them too into relationships that would blur their vision and later be sources for blackmailthe day after the series premiered broberg says she feels huge relief that a more complete version of the story is available i wasnt prepared for people to blame my parents it almost feels like this huge burden is lifted off my shoulders by having the story told right its very close in every way to how it truthfully unfolded i think people get watching myself she had that same kind of brightness i was such a happy girl i was good around adults and i was a people pleaser it really was amazing with mckenna i see all of the emotional intelligence of someone understanding how do you at age 15 16 how do you even portray someone thats brainwashed thats like looking at my brainwashed self again they were just extraordinaryjake lacy as bob berchtold and hendrix yancey as a young jan broberg in peacocks a friend of the family courtesy of peacockyou have a cameo in the final episode what was it like

advertisement jake lacyhas found an interesting register in his late thirties as well a charming asshole that kind of character landed him his first emmy nomination for the white lotus and i suspect hell get another one for playing bob b berchtold a genuine monster who moved into the same neighborhood as the broberg family in the 70s the premiere sets up the first crucial encounter between the berchtold family and the brobergs on a night when the outgoing clan decided to welcome their new neighbors with an indoor picnic as everyone talked and joked b taking that nickname to distinguish him from bob broberg colin hanks became obsessed with jan broberg hendrix yancey early mckenna grace later it feels like he instantly became committed to tearing the broberg family apart andshattering the lives of everyone around him where does one even start with the broberg story how about the fact that bob berchtold a close friend of the brobergs didnt just kidnap jan and take her to mexicohe kidnapped her again two years later how about his technique to brainwash jan convincing her that aliens had taken both of them and would destroy her loved ones if she didnt consent and just wait until you see how close bob got to both mary ann anna paquin and bob in the years before the kidnapping manipulating their weaknesses in a way that made them easier to control theres a reason that jan introduces herself during the premiere and comments on how it was a different time its her way of defending her parents two people who arguably didnt just let the wolf into the hen house but did it twice antosca who has been a leader in this kind of material lately with hulus the act and candy is also delicate with mary ann and bob never resorting to mocking their naivete these were good people who were confronted by evil they didnt even understand when jan is kidnapped the first time someone has to define the word pedophile for them an officer who just learned it himself people were more trusting in middle america in the 1970s because they didnt believe that a friend could also be a monster advertisement playing that kind of monster presents a big challenge for lacy and he rises to it this is a very difficult role in that we will see bob through modern eyes in a way the brobergs couldnt so he cant go too far in his malevolence or risk devolving into camp it has to be a captivating performance so its believable that the brobergs were captivated by him but also cant be too likable eitherlacy nails it even the really toughtoswallow material in episodes three and four that reveal just how much he got his hooks into mary ann and bob comes off as more understandable than it could have with lesser actors or writers just think about how easily a story involving infidelity aliens and multiple kidnappings could have become lurid campy and exploitative antosca his directors and the cast walk a very fine tonal line never turning their show into a depressing dirge but also not giving in to the potential to ryan murphy this thing up with so much focus on bob b and mary annand gail berchtold lio tipton at timesjan herself can get a little lost in the telling of this story im also not sure i love the recasting to age up jan given the story doesnt take place over that long a period of timethe kidnappings were only two years apart while ive seen less of her in whats been sent for review i would have preferred the talented grace play it throughout which is no criticism of the solid yancey but just a belief that one actress would have given jan a stronger throughline despite the success of abducted in plain sight jan brobergs story is one thats still not widely known among the general public and its a story worth telling again a reminder that trust has to be earned and friends can have ulterior motives antosca and his team approached this cautionary tale with the utmost respect for the people caught up in this absolute nightmare and that approach has paid

exceptional performances it sheds light on a chapter in history that deserves attention while also reminding us of the strength and love within families this captivating journey left me moved and inspired and i highly recommend it to anyone seeking a powerful and thoughtprovoking viewing experience show less show more d arc k nov 16 2022 its a great show but also very sad the parents were absolutely negligent and the wife was pathetic its a little disturbing show less show more gabriella m nov 15 2022 oh my gosh where to start jack lacey there is something about how he goes from young just married rich guy in the lotus to slightly at first overly friendly bob berchtold or b as he likes to be called because the family he preys on is headed by bob broburg and of course we must have a differential that is quite the mesmerizing site to behold i didnt even connect him in any way to the broburg s story until i had watched about four lotus episodes and four a friend episodes then as im watching the lotus it just clicked and im like what the what my favorite scene that cemented my highly raised opinion of laceys versatility as an actor was the courtroom scene when after he was caught the first time that is he was standing before the judge a picture of pious remorse and he ended up getting the 5 year maximum sentence reduced to 15 days as the judge gave him credit for time served and the fact that he was a first time offender and showed real remorse uh huh and probably too the fact that he returned jan broburg to her family as pure as snow and the lead detectives were there and lacey upon finding out his fate looked sideways at them with an evilly smug expression and he suddenly changed from wayward family friend to serpent in the grass it was amazing on to colin hanks who seems to have made a career out of playing an everyman father and husband usually from the midwest really weird because i doubt he had that experience as a child and he so perfectly fits right into that niche that i have to keep reminding myself that he was and is the son of legendary actor and director tom hanks the role of bob broburg needed an actor who could slip easily into 70s middleaged head of a morman family without anyone suspecting that he was actually colin hanks and he did it i didnt catch on until about the middle of the first episode then again im like omg that middleaged balding man oozing a strong 1970s brady bunch vibe is non other than colin hanks anna paquin usually strong enough to repel two vampires also slipped effortlessly into mousy obedient pious mormon wife a credit to her acting skills is that she seems totally overlooked as the tour de force actor she usually is the actress who played jan broburg there are to young actors who are doppelgangers to each other the girl who played the daughter of jon hamm and january jones in the series mad men kiernan shipka and a different actor who looks very similiar to her makenna grace who is in the role of jan broburg amazingly enough grace also plays young handmaid esther in the handmaids tale she did a phenomenal job playing typical 1970s midwest morman teenager great interactions with the other kids especially her two younger sisters who also gave way more than adequate performances also of note is the actor who plays bs wife the beaten down but still eager to please wife next door jenny amazing performances were given by all in summary berchtold was very evil and knew how to manipulate anyone if he was even a smidgen like the real bob berchtold jan broburgs parents had to be terrified of him show less show more michele l nov 13 2022 putin prea lung dar terifiant show less show more andrei d nov 13 2022 very good show sad but good show less show more traci unbreakable g

1030am during a recent gold derby video interview senior editor rob licuria spoke indepth with mckenna grace a friend of the family about her peacock limited series which is eligible at the 2023 emmys watch the full video above and read the complete interview transcript below i am just so proud to have gotten to tell jans story and gotten to play her and portray her the actress revealed in our webchat grace later explained truly at the end of the day i was telling a story about resilience and about strength and about jan coming back together with her family seewatch more than 400 interviews with 2023 emmy contenders rob licuria im rob licuria senior editor at gold derby here with the one and only emmy nominated actor mckenna grace mckenna i was saying to you offline that a role like this in a friend of the family just looks so emotionally exhausting jan broberg who you play does a lot of crying a lot of time has passed since you filmed that but when you think back was that really as challenging as it seemed because yeah it looked very emotional mckenna grace a lot of hard work went into this project id have to im really really proud of this project but its funny because being on this set i learned so much about myself and about acting because i had to do a lot of things and push myself to places that i hadnt gone before so i really learned a lot and looking back now ive done a project since then and im like i could have done so much better now that i i dont know i did that project and i feel like i learned so much im like oh i could have done so much better but it was really emotionally and sometimes physically exhausting but i am just so proud to have gotten to tell jans story and gotten to play her and portray her story rl yeah im sure im sure absolutely and someone of your age youre still so young and yet youve been working for such a long time i would call you almost like an old veteran at this rate but still you must do you have to rely on your support network your parents your family your friends to get you through where youre playing somebody who was so mistreated and sexually abused that must have been quite challenging even just personally mg i mean yeah i think that playing heavy roles always comes with some it always comes with some heaviness and some weight but i mean truly at the end of the day i was telling a story about resilience and about strength and about jan coming back together with her family and getting to tell her story and i think that one of the things that our show did that i really like is that at the very beginning before the first episode starts you have jan explaining the real life jan sitting there and explaining this may be hard to believe but its my story and this is what happened to me and im still here and so it gives you some hope and you get to see that she made it out on the other side and shes so strong and im so happy to have her in my life but yeah i do definitely luckily i have parents who really support me in what i do and are always like if you dont want to be doing this then we can always not have you be an actress or if you want to do something else im like no way because truly this is what i love more than anything else so yeah i guess that gets me through it is just knowing that this is what i love doing rl thats right and its your job and its good that you can separate the two but nick antosca the creator of the series i told him that this was genius having jan herself introduce this series because it made me feel kind of safe that we were able to delve into this very uncomfortable backstory or her life story because without that i wouldve felt it was being exploitative so on that note i wonder how you felt about having her so available to you as a resource onset during production i know jake lacey felt really really positive about that what about you mg no me too that was the biggest thing for me going into this role was the first thing one of the first things that i asked nick on zoom whenever i first read the first four scripts no i read the whole series i think i stayed up all night reading the whole series i was like theres no way but i got on zoom with them and i was like is jan actually a part of this because i dont feel good or comfortable about telling this story or playing her if she isnt on board with it and luckily she was so on board and from the getgo from the first time that i talked to her we were on facetime for two hours and both of us cried and she was constantly so available to me i think that one of the scariest things about taking this role was that not only am i playing jan a real life person whos a big part of this production and telling her familys story and its a story thats really dark and has a lot of heavy subject material but im also coming in halfway through the shoot because im jan in her older years so im also coming in after theyve already gotten to know each other and everybodys been shooting for two months and developed bonds or whatever and so i was terrified so i really tried to learn as much as i could about the story and i dove so deep into jans backstory i read her book that she wrote with her mother and she sent me a transcript for a newer one thats been released since then and i had court documents and her old diary and all of the letters between her and b and i would stay up even though i had a 600 am call time id be up till four reading all of this stuff in my hotel room up in the dark of my room but it really meant the world having jan being so open and honest with me constantly it really felt safer i felt like hopefully i can really do jan right and i can ask her questions if i need to rl wow as you know that doesnt come around very often on a project what a gift to be able to do that and then it reminds me as you mentioned you took over the role from hendrix yancey who plays the younger jan and shes wonderful as well in that role in this role you both i think youre both together collaboratively not that you work together necessarily but because youre in different timelines but i just feel like is there any scope at all for you to even meet with hendrix or did you keep it separate how does that work because you play jen so consistently throughout the series it felt like you were so aligned with the way that was going to work so talk me through that mg well pretty much there was her and i were actually staying at the same hotel me and all of the girls who were the sisters and the youngers and all of us were in the same hotel so wed all go out for lunch and whatnot and there was about a twoweek overlap of hendrix and i being there and then for some of the flashbacks in the later episode she came back further down the line and we hung out again but for me as a child actor who has played a lot of younger versions of people that was so exciting for me to have a younger version of myself that was mindblowing so i was so stoked i think oh my gosh my mom and i were talking to her mom earlier today on the phone but it was so cool to get to know her and to be able to work with her kind of there was about a twoweek overlap like i said and i just tried to spend a lot of time with her because i wasnt able to watch her performance as jan until a little bit later until they had clips so i tried to spend a lot of time with her and pick up on the little things that she does it was complicated because not only was i playing her version of jan but then im also trying to play jan jan and then also bring in myself to the role so i was playing three different people at once and it was hilarious and really exciting to be able to explore rl i just think that youre really exercising so many muscles as a performer because you do have to bring your own voice your own spirit to the role and make it your own but of course you have to be aware of what hendrix was doing and youve got the real jan thats a lot and you just hit the nail on the head mckenna because for years now weve always talked about with you youve played the younger this the younger that and suddenly you are obviously coming of age as a performer where you are now old enough to play the characters in their adulthood and you now get to do for younger actors what so many wonderful performers were doing for you i mean how does that what does that mean for you because now youre moving forward you get to impart some of the stuff that was given to you as a young performer mg its really exciting to be its such a weird industry to grow up in and it is a weird thing to work as you grow up but theres nothing id rather be doing and its really cool as i get older to continue to know more about this industry and what i do and to explore the different realms within acting and directing and producing and writing and then what goes on behind the scenes and the makeup and the hair and to be able to really dive in depth to all of that its just been cool to be able to have my passion for this grow and grow and grow and theres truly nothing i would rather be doing so its really cool because i came out to la to become an actress whenever i was so young really having no idea what that meant or idea just how this was going to become my life so ive probably made so many mistakes and then theres also been so much hard work but also a lot of luck so its cool to be able to tell hendrix or other actors or actresses who are my age or younger to be able to share just a little bit of the crumbs that ive managed to learn over the years i guess rl yeah absolutely so youre playing jan opposite jake lacey whos playing b berchtold i think jake is an extraordinary actor and he was mesmerizing in this the two of you together on the screen i felt like it was just so compelling id just love to know what did you most value about working with him he said to me that he just thought every moment working with you was such a joy given it was so difficult to do the material yeah how did you feel about working with jake mg that guy no i genuinely i think that he was so magnificent in this series and captivating and captivating to watch not just on screen but whenever he was performing because theres so many alternative takes and completely different directions that the scenes went in that werent used in the series so its just interesting to remember and to think back like whoa that was a crazy scene or that was crazy to shoot and just thinking about his performances truly this show has been one of the craziest and most interesting experiences because within acting i learned so much so its one of my favorite things to talk about especially jake and is scenes and the relationship that we were portraying because its interesting to have to portray a relationship like that having the scope and knowing what you know about the story and whats truly happening because as jan you have to throw all of that out the window because she truly believed him this was a man who completely made her feel safe and this is a second father to her a best friend that it turns and then it gets strange but im protecting my family but i love him does that mean i love him as a husband or do i just love him as a family member but he loves me like a wife and it just gets so complicated as the years go on and whenever i got thrown into the mix as older jan there had already been the complete brainwashing so im already completely in his grasp so for me it was really an exercise in acting because in my mind i couldnt come onto set having my lines in a set way in my head how i wanted the scene to go or how i wanted to say them or how i wanted to react or respond because it truly solely depended on what jake did so if jake was giving me this or if he changed the inflection or the emotion one bit then i have to hang on his every word because thats what jan had going through her life its just hanging on his word did he mention the aliens oh he sounds a little angry did i do something wrong rl yeah mg so it was so complicated and hes such an incredible actor so it was a crazy experience and im such a fan of his im such a fan of his rl i am too to be honest mg it was complicated rl so just thinking about particular scenes theres so many but i love the secondtolast episode where the car accident and jans saying to b that shes going to be in a play and he switches on a dime and obviously the car accident means that shes broken on the outside but it gave me some insight that shes so broken on the inside as well and i am curious as a im not a actor i have no idea but do you switch on and switch off that very overt emotion particularly when you have to cry a lot or do you need to stay in the moment when youre shooting scenes like that just to help you be more authentic mg i mean it really truly depends it really depends on is that what were shooting all day long is that what were doing is this a moment but i like to if i know that i have a really strong emotional scene or i have to convey a lot of emotions or if thats the first scene up i like to come onto set and i just listen to a lot of music i dont stay in that because i dont want to just be walking around set crying or something but i listen to a lot of music because i find that its something that can really pull me in but also push me out of an emotion so i just come onto set i listen to a lot of music and i like to know if were five minutes out and then hone in on whatever emotion im supposed to be feeling rl wow ive heard other actors tell me about music is so transportative in very in many ways are you one of the actors who dont like to tell people what youre listening to or are you free to say this is what i generally listen to if i need to be sad mg it really depends i love talking about music so im so down i have a public spotify place where i just post a bunch of playlists and some of them i make playlists depending on characters ill make playlists for i dont think i had one for jan i think that i would just listen to i just listened to my music that made me feel something every once in a while but i listened to a lot of sad music while i was on that set i listened to a lot of phoebe bridgers and i dont know rl nice yeah it totally works i totally see why youre doing that so look we have chatted a few times already the last time was about the bad seed before that was about handmaids for which you received an emmy nomination and i know its not its a dumb question to say oh why are you attracted to a role youre not attracted to them but youre very smart in your choices you are obviously still quite young and youve got decades ahead of you in your career youve made very smart choices you are a serious actor youre not just some frivolous actor who just does whatever comes your way so talk me through the process of with i assume your parents of making those choices and picking roles that are very challenging that are going to really put you on the edge yeah talk me through those choices mg can i just say thank you that really means a lot because i dont know i try so hard thats really my dream is to just be a serious actress and to do these projects that really mean something so thank you but i dont know my parents and i have a lot of trust in each other i always before taking on a script or something even if im completely in love with it i always make sure that my mom or dad reads it just because im like i want a second opinion im in love with this and even if youre not in love with it im still going to be in love with it but i want to know what you think i want to know your thoughts or something because i want somebody to talk about it with but whenever it comes to choosing rules i mean im just lucky to be getting the roles that im getting im honored to have been able to portray the stories that ive had so far but i dont know i just really hope that i can continue to do this i really love to tell stories that feel important to me that tell something for a reason that arent just something that i found very tasteful about our show is that theres a lot of shock value in our culture nowadays so i really appreciated that there was no sexual assault on screen and that there was no real super nudity or whatnot it really focused on the psychological effects of this manipulator and of course everything that happened still happened but it didnt have to be seen so i really like to tell stories that i find mean something to me and i also really like to be challenged as an actress because i dont know how am i going to get better if i just continue to do things that i feel safe in and even though i look back and im like dang it i could have done so much better at least now i know that i can do better and ive learned so much from that experience and its been really cool lately to see myself evolve and grow and learn new things and oh now i can do this i never knew that i could feel that emotion and portray that its been really really cool as of lately but yeah i dont know im just really truly happy with the projects ive been able to do lately and i hope that i can continue down that path rl lets hope so yeah im so looking forward to speaking to you in 10 years time when youre almost a completely different performer well see what happens mckenna but in the meantime congratulations on some beautiful work in a friend of the family and thanks for your time today mg no thank you so so much its always cool talking with you its the coolest

really with fresh eyes i received the script from the writer showrunner nick antosca and it was just so exceptionally written and the characters were so vivid on the page and the world was so beautifully rendered that i just kind of devoured the script immediately we talked to hittman as part of our meet the experts tv directors panel watch our exclusive video interview above click the cc button on the video for closed captioning subtitles seeinterviews with top emmy contenders a friend of the family tells the disturbing true story of jan broberg played at different ages by mckenna grace and hendrix yancey who in the 1970s was abducted multiple times by robert berchtold played by jake lacy a neighbor who had ingratiated himself into the lives of the broberg family the story was previously told in the 2017 documentary abducted in plain sight but theres so much missing and omitted from the narrative based on how compressed the documentary was so i think that what the show does is it really opens up the 10 years of their lives and shows how he was able to manipulate and sort of get control of her life true crime dramas like a friend of the family have been popular in recent years and hittman has thought a lot about the ethics of the genre but in this case broberg herself was onboard as a producer making this a rare scenario  where the victim has given consent beyond that what jan did was bring a level of depth to the characters that maybe we wouldnt have had had she not been on set its not just the story of a crime its the story of a family and jans perspective on her family on who her parents were as individuals on who they were as parents really helped bring shades of color to all of these characters on screen predictthe 2023 emmy nominees through july 12 30 best

opening is usually where a disclaimer goes for a series like a friend of the family one that dramatizes the events behind a story that came to public attention through an acclaimed or at least widelyseen documentary its almost second nature now to start off any discussion with a acknowledgment that many of the details are an open matter anyone who wants to know the story beforehand particularly those who might want to avoid certain subject matter the story addresses can easily find a concise summary with a few clicks creators will go to great lengths to try to preserve a certain kind of viewing experience one with twists unspoiled and jarring turns hidden amidst a sea of reallife stories of manipulation and grief and predation being turned into tv series a friend of the family is one that stands out because its not constructed in that way in telling the story of jan broberg and her familys attempts to undo the damage wrought by someone they trusted this peacock series takes an approach to a tv adaptation that refreshingly has little concern for truecrime expectations if theres a shock that comes with b escalating rides home and manufactured hangouts into kidnapping jan played at different ages by hendrix yancey and mckenna grace a friend of the family doesnt sensationalize it there arent really any artificial sinister stings underneath lacys performance no ironic judgment passed as these two families try to create an idyllic early70s life for the multiple children on each side the foundation being laid is not to expect what comes next though those who have seen skye borgmans documentary abducted in plain sight have an idea of what later episodes might address but to understand the complicated psychological ground that the rest of the series builds on jake lacy and hendrix yancey in a friend of the familyerika dosspeacock much of what comes after is an ongoing negotiation between the adults involved theres manipulation of feelings of trust and of fear that any one false move could lead to irreparable harm paquin is the main example of how these performers play each selfrationalizing step of their characters decisionmaking processes in small beats eerie and effective in changing in tiny shades through bob trying to assert the control over his familys safety hanks is most devastating in playing someone who realizes that hes not only been caught in a trap hes been an unwitting accomplice and tipton is fantastic here bringing some resolve to someone trying to convince herself that what shes doing and how shes conveying her husbands secret messages secondhand is part of a greater helpful plan bs actions do become the catalyst for the worst parts of the broberg familys ordeal and a lot of a friend of the family is driven by every new way he finds to emotionally swindle them but a friend of the family also makes the important distinction that this is not his story something that would be evident even if jan broberg didnt personally introduce the series herself it charts the various ways bs able to get past everyones emotional and physical defenses mainly through looking at what his victims are left with it would be easy to gawk at a family as one character does in the series fourth episode for their willingness to trust a child with someone who would say or do the things that b is shown to do before and after the kidnapping what this series and lacys performance do have is an unusually high level of patience creating an atmosphere where even if someone cant fully understand the brobergs actions its a lot easier to empathize with their starting point part of that comes from a friend of the family choosing not to make this story a referendum on their faith and instead making it more a window into how one person can manipulate the trust that comes from a closeknit community it spares the brobergs and to a certain extent bs family from condescension the closest the show comes to painting b as an outright monster is showing all the people who worked around their personal objections in order to do what helped get b what he wanted a friend of the family is honed in on perspective here in other ways it doesnt take long for hittman to put the audience right in jans eyes seeing how she takes in a room the handful of times the show returns to that point of view says just as much about what changes for her and her family without even realizing it it starts out in that first episode as a wonder breadpartridge family ideal complete with the faint amber glaze the decade often gets in retrospect ariel marx who also provided the music for the antoscaproduced candy earlier this year delivers another hypnotic score that locates the unease underneath a sparkling exterior as that smiling family public image gets punctured by tiny pinpricks that crystalclear field of vision starts to get more hazy the more that the brobergs start to question what forces are guiding their daughter the more that everything around her starts to blur for those watching too the time period certainly helps in creating at atmosphere of innocence and plausible deniability its not just the brobergs who are often at a loss for the language to put into words the kind of manipulative personality theyre dealing with a friend of the family slowbuilds a community atmosphere where the daily give and take of implicit trust is the rule not the exception realizing that b is meticulously using the desire to keep up that facade and not risk losing an idealized vision of human nature is one of the sharpest ways that a friend of the family makes this more about motivation than sensation anna paquin in a friend of the familypeacock for most of its runtime the horror in a friend of a family is through suggestion its the terror of never really knowing what happened to someone you love because they refuse to speak about it the show is trying to capture a specific perspective on an experience that many will likely find at least some kernel of truth to which to relate the same attempt to approach the unthinkable with reason and calm that put the brobergs at a disadvantage in the legal system and in their interactions with b ends up being the best way to understand what happened even a halfcentury later therell certainly be conversations about how this story is paced particularly when compared against a film that covered major points on the timeline in 91 minutes it will be easy for some to argue that nine episodes is an overindulgent canvas to the extent that a friend of the family is repetitive thats not entirely untrue b is a character whose singleminded goals dont allow for much change past a certain point except for maybe who his chosen target is but its also helpful to keep in mind that this is not a show designed to be talked about in all caps it is meticulous to a very specific end and with a particular goal as something that slot right into a subgenres contenthungry ecosystem a friend of the family is refreshingly unsuccessful by prizing clarity over shock its an admirable adjustment for what we expect from stories like it grade b the
