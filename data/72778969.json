{"id": 72778969, "key": "The Signal (Ted Lasso)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Signal%20%28Ted%20Lasso%29", "text": "\"The Signal\" is the sixth episode of the second season of the American sports comedy-drama television series Ted Lasso, based on the character played by Jason Sudeikis in a series of promos for NBC Sports' coverage of England's Premier League. It is the 16th overall episode of the series and was written by main cast member Brett Goldstein and directed by Erica Dunton. It was released on Apple TV+ on August 27, 2021.\n\nThe series follows Ted Lasso, an American college football coach, who is unexpectedly recruited to coach a fictional English Premier League soccer team, AFC Richmond, despite having no experience coaching soccer. The team's owner, Rebecca Welton, hires Lasso hoping he will fail as a means of exacting revenge on the team's previous owner, Rupert, her unfaithful ex-husband. The previous season saw Rebecca change her mind on the club's direction and working Ted in saving it, although the club is relegated from the Premier League. In the episode, Richmond prepares to compete for the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Meanwhile, Rebecca is visited by her mother, who separated from her husband.\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with critics praising the performances, writing, themes and character development. For her performance in the episode, Harriet Walter was nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series at the 74th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\n\nPlot\nWith Roy (Brett Goldstein) joining as their coach, AFC Richmond has now won four games, improving their position. Meanwhile, Rebecca (Hannah Waddingham) has a one-night stand with a man she met on a site, when she is visited by her mother, Deborah (Harriet Walter).\n\nRebecca invites Ted (Jason Sudeikis) to lunch with her and Deborah, which he accepts. At the bar, Deborah announces that she is separating from Rebecca's father, although Rebecca notes that it happens quite often. Meanwhile, Jamie (Phil Dunster) is angry that Roy refuses to train him, despite having improved his behavior with the club. When questioned by Ted, Roy claims that Jamie has become an average player who will not reach his potential unless he brings out part of his aggressive past behavior, but only when it is needed. When Jamie asks when will that time come, Roy just says he'll give him a signal.\n\nAFC Richmond now competes with Tottenham Hotspur F.C. to enter the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. As Richmond is struggling, Roy decides it is time for \"the signal\", which consists of Roy, Beard (Brendan Hunt) and Nate (Nick Mohammed) giving Jamie the finger. Motivated, Jamie scores a goal via a free kick as the first half finishes. However, Ted has a panic attack, forcing him to leave the game with some minutes left. As Richmond is distracted, the Spurs seize the opportunity to score a goal via a corner kick. As Beard and Roy debate on what to do, Nate decides to substitute three of the players and be more defensive, which leads to Richmond's victory when Jamie scores another goal on the counter-attack.\n\nNate is hailed by the media for his role in the victory, earning him respect among the public. Higgins (Jeremy Swift) also advises Beard to break up with his girlfriend, as she may not be suitable for him, although Beard still goes out with her. Rebecca tries to find Ted but fails to find him in the stadium and the offices. As she returns home, she finds that her mother left and claimed to reconcile with Rebecca's father. She prepares to meet with the man from the previous days, while she receives a message from her Bantr match, who turns out to be Sam (Toheeb Jimoh). As everyone leaves the stadium, Sharon (Sarah Niles) goes to her office, finding Ted, who wants a session.\n\nDevelopment\n\nProduction\nThe episode was directed by Erica Dunton and written by main cast member Brett Goldstein. This was Dunton's second directing credit, and Goldstein's second writing credit for the show.\n\nCritical reviews\n\"The Signal\" received critical acclaim. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \"A-\" and wrote, \"'The Signal' has lots of great moments sprinkled throughout, but the central juxtaposition between a thrilling victory for AFC Richmond and an A.T.L. for Ted elevates the proceedings, and pushes the show into another gear at the halfway point in the season. And the most effective part of the episode is that although I have some lingering concerns stemming from the choices in last week's episode, I don't really know where things go from here: the team might be on an upward swing, but the show is descending into deeper emotional territory, and unpacking it has the potential to elevate the storytelling further. And sure, it could also mess everything up, but that's how television works, and we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\" \n\nAlan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone wrote, \"By sprinkling in more conflict — and repeatedly confronting the question of whether Ted's smiling persona is actually doing harm to both himself and the team — 'The Signal' was the season's most satisfying episode yet.\" \n\nKeith Phipps of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"I still adore this show and think what it's doing in this second season — experimenting with what can be done with a sitcom without traditional conflicts — has been just as compelling as what it did in the first season.\" Becca Newton of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Ted's panic attacks were bound to come up again, and having him suffer one now makes for a nice transition to the second half of the season.\" \n\nLinda Holmes of NPR wrote, \"'The Signal' is a jam-packed episode, plot-wise, moving a bunch of stories forward in important ways. But nothing in it matters as much as Ted and Dr. Sharon.\" Christopher Orr of The New York Times wrote, \"If this week's episode, 'The Signal', seems a bit scattered (and it does), it is in large part because it has returned to the nuts-and-bolts business of moving multiple subplots forward.\"\n\nAwards and accolades\nFor the episode, Harriet Walter was nominated for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination at the 74th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.

and deeply frustrating view all posts by alan sepinwall august 27 2021 colin huttonapple tv a review of this weeks ted lasso the signal coming up just as soon as i make a joke for people born in the early to midseventies midway through the signal roy kent offers a characteristically blunt assessment of what teds leadership has done for jamie on the pitch ted has ruined him youve made him a team player roy explains you got him to pass and shit and in doing so youve made him average this notion is interesting on a few levels first its another reminder that as good a man as ted may be his skills as a football coach remain very much in question more importantly roys critique is a direct indictment of the ethos of ted lasso both man and series teds default assumption is that making the players into better people will make them into better players often this is the case spurred on by the roy kent effect richmond has been winning a lot lately and in this episode becomes a very unlikely semifinalist in the fa cup after beating tottenham but roy is correct about most things the state of jamies game included when he and the other coaches offer the titular signal  flipping jamie the bird from the sidelines of the match against tottenham  jamie has permission to play like the insufferable ass he used to be and it leads to an easy richmond goal  for the series american viewers ted helpfully describes the fa cup as a march madnessstyle tournament in the middle of the season where every club in the country is eligible to play at some point its a very real thing but also a clever device to allow richmond to play with the big boys for a few episodes even while the team is still stuck in the championship  editors picks the 250 greatest guitarists of all time the 500 greatest albums of all time the 50 worst decisions in movie history the 100 best albums of 2023 with the signal though season two seems to be agreeing with roy and deciding that sometimes things work out better when people dont get along the episode offers more conflict than this years previous episodes combined roy versus jamie higgins versus coach beard and the other diamond dogs rebecca versus her mother nate versus his insecurities regarding his place on the coaching staff and most importantly ted lasso versus himself  a nice comic touch roy is on the coaching staff now but he is very much not one of the diamond dogs having no patience for any of that barking foolishness related stories jason sudeikis puzzled by joy behars claim she was offered ted lasso role taika waititis next goal wins has one big problem taika waititi for now though its a mostly very good week for richmond the team is on a win streak that continues when nate assumes command in teds absence ordering isaac to park the bus  play conservatively  and trusting that their opponents would be the ones to make a mistake late in a tie game this should feel like another great triumph from the clubs former equipment manager  especially given his clear anxiety about what the roy kent effect means for his place in the coaching staffs pecking order  but it instead seems to be fueling his ego with him dubbing himself the wonder kid mistaking the phrase for wunderkind in a postgame interview higgins isnt able to dissuade beard from letting jane move in with him but beard at least expresses appreciation for leslies concern rebecca survives a visit from her mother played by the esteemed british actor dame harriet walter has sex with another handsome and often naked guy and keeps flirting with her bantr mystery man oblivious to the fact that he is none other than sam obisanya and roys new approach to jamie doesnt seem to have dismantled the emotional repair job dr sharon did on the teams star  he just knows now how to switch back into ahole mode when necessary then switch it back off afterwards  much more to say about this in ensuing weeks but for now i will just note that george wendts nephew is cocreator of a show that now has set up some unresolved sexual tension between characters named sam and rebecca by sprinkling in more conflict  and repeatedly confronting the question of whether teds smiling persona is actually doing harm to both himself and the team  the signal was the seasons most satisfying episode yet ted lasso tv  movies tv  movies recaps more news

friend when beard gets back together with jane and rebecca struggles with her obligations as a daughter when her mother breezes into town and ted who has been sprinting to stay ahead of his own brain for quite a while runs out of room playbyplay jamie and roy afc richmond wins a game right off the bat and it turns out its their fourth in a row jamie however is frustrated by the fact that new coach roy whos being credited for the teams successes just refuses to coach him when roy finally relents its to say that ted is at fault hes made jamie average by pushing the teamplayer angle so hard to the exclusion of all else roy commands jamie to act like more of a jerk though he does not say jerk stressing that the key is to be able to take command of your jerk tendencies and use them to your advantage and so at a critical moment in a tournament game against tottenham hotspur the entire coaching staff flips jamie the bird which is his signal to get selfish he does and it works and the team chalks up another big win rebecca and her momhiggins and beard rebecca is in the middle of sexing sexily with sexy luca when her mother drops in for an unannounced visit and announces that shes left rebeccas dad while ted and keeley treat this like a big deal rebecca warily insists it isnt her mother leaves her father every so often and her father offers up a big gift and her mother goes right back to him rebecca finds common ground with higgins whos the only one of the diamond dogs willing to voice the concern they all share that beards relationship with jane is toxic finding himself dismissed when he tries to go at the issue gently higgins decides that he has to keep trying so he goes at it less gently while beard doesnt take higgins advice they share a backthumping hug because beard knows hes trying to help and then jane makes beard wear a beret so higgins is even righter than he already was rebecca overhears some of this in the parking lot and goes home to have a similar talk with her mom but it turns out that mom coaxed with a new tesla has indeed returned to dad just as rebecca predicted this sends rebecca right back to luca despite the fact that shes also very much enjoying her flirtation with her bantr beau who we learn is  sam obisanya dun dun dun although neither of them knows theyre texting each other yet ted one of the things that came up in season one that has not  before now  really come up in season two is teds panic attack at karaoke night while rebecca was singing let it go although that was not why he panicked it was clear that this acute attack had been brought on by his divorce and once rebecca came and spoke to him and he dealt with the divorce papers the issue of his mental health largely receded but panic is not a oneepisode problem while hes in the middle of coaching a critical game ted begins to panic he cant focus everything feels out of whack his hands feel wrong and in the end he flees the field rebecca is the one who goes looking for him suspecting she knows whats wrong but the next time we see him he hasnt sought out rebecca hes sought out dr sharon hiding out in her office in the dark until she returns at which point he says that he wants an appointment enlarge this image ted jason sudeikis is having a tough time even though he looks happy apple tv hide caption toggle caption apple tv apple tv game analysis there are a lot of theories to say the least about the relationship between season one of ted lasso and season two my theory is this season one set up an extraordinarily compelling beautifully executed not particularly emotionally complex underdog story in which a simple good man overcame being completely unqualified for his job won everyone over rehabilitated a cold rich dragon lady and taught a team that winning isnt everything season two has complicated all of that maybe the man is not all that good at his job maybe his philosophy didnt help the team that much maybe theres a lot of ego in his mentoring style maybe hes not a simple man but one driven by demons maybe hes not the key to all these peoples happiness maybe they are all just as wise as he is just as special a lot of these complications were delicately hinted at in the first season too but this stretch has been where you begin to sink into them the matter of dr sharon the signal is a jampacked episode plotwise moving a bunch of stories forward in important ways but nothing in it matters as much as ted and dr sharon she was not part of that first season and she is not part of its mythology she has not embraced teds style she has not taken him on as a close friend she has not offered him pearls of wisdom she has set up an office she has served the players who wanted her help and she has said to ted effectively i am available to you if you need my help she has claimed for herself the one thing that a simpler version of this story would suggest no one can truly have emotional distance from ted ted can be an emotionally extravagant show but this has been a very disciplined story which has endeavored to avoid some of the pitfalls of the black lady therapist trope aisha harris wrote about in slate back in 2018 some of those pitfalls remain because its impossible to however thoughtfully opt out of the concept of context but that emotional distance does i think reduce the blurring of the line between the black therapist and the black best friend that aisha notes weve come to know sharon as a character because of discussions she has while standing in doorways and hallways from the tone of her voice and how she moves through rooms the scenes that have built that character couldnt just be between ted and a friend of teds its so interesting that they made the decision not to show sharons sessions as we got to know her even though therapy scenes can provide a neat excuse to make the subtext into text we dont know what she said to jamie or what she said to dani and she has been around for a bunch of episodes without really counseling ted in any meaningful way she hasnt interacted with ted as a therapist shes interacted with him as a colleague by whom hes threatened because shes better than he is at things that he believes define him and his value to the world i used to talk to a friend about the idea that the meaning of life is to connect with other people and matter to the world lots of people dont believe that but i kind of do and i definitely think ted does welcome to anxiety club ted for that reason for ted to go to sharon for help is a profound admission on his part not only of his need for help in general but of the thing hes feared the most ever since she rescued dani from the yips she knows how to fix problems he doesnt know how to fix this is a show that deeply believes in the power of personal friendship so theres particular punch in teds realization that he doesnt need rebecca however supportive she wants to be he needs a doctor this precisely echoes the scene a couple of episodes ago in which ted and rebecca shared their belief that only people without friends need therapists ted didnt have this particular panic attack because of one immediate crisis the way he did with the one at karaoke certainly everything with the team is very stressful and hed received a call about henry that reminded him how much of his sons daytoday life hes missing a seed that was planted in the christmas episode but theyve done a good job of creating teds anxiety as a pressure thats building and bound to ultimately need a release of some kind the teams wins are being credited to the roy kent effect teds been vilified for months while they struggle and as we discussed last week his good cheer has started to look performative and overdone this was bound to happen he has to deal with it thats anxiety as i personally have experienced it there are some really beautiful shots of rebecca looking for ted in the locker room theyre just lovely and lonely and the decision not to show the end of the game but only the players bursting in with excitement wrapping the concerned rebecca up in a whirlwind of glee very smart good stuff enlarge this image deborah harriet walter visits rebecca hannah waddingham this week apple tv hide caption toggle caption apple tv apple tv love and rebecca also bubbling along all season has been rebeccas love life and its an interesting choice to go in for a closeup on her parents and their marriage just as her own romantic life  both her sexforward relationship with luca and her conversationonly relationship with the guy she doesnt yet know to be sam this initially looks like your basic funny mom comes to town story particularly during the very entertaining and delightfully structured scene involving luca deborah rebecca and mena the cleaner ill start in the study and it really is very entertaining particularly given that i could watch hannah waddingham yell out a window all day and never get tired but its also a pretty sad realization that rebecca has spent her life trying to talk her mother into expecting more for herself given that we know rebecca married a jerk who lied to her and made her feel foolish rebecca comes by her skepticism about relationships quite honestly at this point  whats she going to do about the two guys shes now involved with both of whom she genuinely seems to like and only one of whom shes met theyve been laying the groundwork for rebecca and sam liking each other for a while she was very helpful with dubai air of course but he was also hugely kind to nora and hes the one with the biggest grin on his face when her mother shouts down to the players on the field the idea that they connect doesnt come out of nowhere end notes another thing on my mind this week the show is doing some interesting thinking about something television almost never takes seriously the shape of friendships among men for me it was really weird that nobody except higgins wanted to say out loud that they thought beard going back to jane was a terrible idea teds point about regretting telling the truth about such things maaaaybe dont do it at the wedding theodore even though that was a terrific payoff of that setup is relatable of course but i feel like there are lots of groups of friends where people would absolutely speak up about someone getting back together with a toxic ex for obvious reasons ive never been in conversations among exclusively male friends so i have no way of knowing whether thats gendered but i wonder if it is if you believe that the second season is complicating the fairly straightforward underdogvictory world that was built in the first season you can also find evidence of that in the story of young nate shelley an underdog among underdogs in season one he started season two pushing will around and now threatened by roys arrival on the coaching staff he ends the episode reading all about himself on twitter not everyone finds success easy to adjust to enlarge this image jamie phil dunster and roy brett goldstein are not getting along this week apple tv hide caption toggle caption apple tv apple tv roy and jamie too are a longbubbling story that could easily have resolved at the same time the rest of the team started to warm back up to jamie but it makes sense that it would take roy longer both because they havent been spending time together and because their relationship was complicated both by their different positions on the team last year and by their relationships with keeley its usually been the case that jamie is wrong about everything so when ted points out quite correctly that roy is being a jerk for being unwilling to coach jamie it complicates  theres that word again  what was previously the bratty kid versus wise but gruff veteran dynamic between them i also think its really smart to acknowledge that being able to annoy other players is in moderation absolutely a skill that a lot of greats possess jamies taunting of his opponent reminded me a lot of reggie miller of the indiana pacers and i encourage you most vigorously to watch the documentary winning time if you ever get the chance this week in ted
