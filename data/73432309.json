{"id": 73432309, "key": "The Day After (The Americans)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Day%20After%20%28The%20Americans%29", "text": "\"The Day After\" is the ninth episode of the fourth season of the American period spy drama television series The Americans. It is the 48th overall episode of the series and was written by co-producer Tracey Scott Wilson, and directed by Daniel Sackheim. It was released on FX on May 11, 2016.\n\nThe series is set during the Cold War and follows Elizabeth and Philip Jennings, two Soviet KGB intelligence officers posing as an American married couple living in Falls Church, a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., with their American-born children Paige and Henry. It also explores the conflict between Washington's FBI office and the KGB Rezidentura there, from the perspectives of agents on both sides, including the Jennings' neighbor Stan Beeman, an FBI agent working in counterintelligence. In the episode, Elizabeth sees her friendship with Young Hee threatened with her new assignment. Everyone watches The Day After, which explores the effects of a nuclear warfare.\n\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by an estimated 0.90 million household viewers and gained a 0.2 ratings share among adults aged 18–49. The episode received critical acclaim, with critics praising Keri Russell's performance and the series' exploration of The Day After.\n\nPlot\nPhilip (Matthew Rhys) takes Paige (Holly Taylor) to an empty parking lot to give her driving lessons. Afterwards, she says that the church is having their last meeting and that Pastor Tim (Kelly AuCoin) would like to see the Jennings attend. Philip later meets with William (Dylan Baker), who reports that his lab is working on a modified version of the Lassa virus. William is disturbed by the discovery and is doubting over reporting this to the Centre.\n\nThat night, everyone watches the television film, The Day After, which explores the conflict of a nuclear exchange. Oleg (Costa Ronin) watches it with Tatiana (Vera Cherny), and recounts how a nuclear false alarm incident almost led to similar events. Philip starts to believe in William's concern, but Elizabeth (Keri Russell) says the virus will be used against them. Elizabeth continues seeing Young Hee (Ruthie Ann Miles), babysitting her children in order to find anything incriminating in their house.\n\nRealizing she will need to seduce Don (Rob Yang) in order to find more, Elizabeth decides to move forward, even knowing that this could ruin her friendship with Young Hee. She invites him to her apartment, where she kisses him and drugs his drink to lose consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in bed with a naked Elizabeth, making him believe they had sex. Horrified, he leaves. Philip accompanies Paige to the church meeting, where Pastor Tim suggests they could talk in detail after he returns from missionary work in Ethiopia. Seeing that she has felt saddened, he takes her on another driving lesson, this time on his Camaro Z-28. When Elizabeth returns, Philip comforts her, as Elizabeth feels her friendship with Young Hee is over.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\nIn April 2016, FX confirmed that the ninth episode of the season would be titled \"The Day After\", and that it would be written by co-producer Tracey Scott Wilson, and directed by Daniel Sackheim. This was Wilson's fifth writing credit, and Sackheim's seventh directing credit.\n\nFilming\nFilming for the episode wrapped by January 29, 2016.\n\nReception\n\nViewers\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Day After\" was seen by an estimated 0.90 million household viewers with a 0.2 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a 12% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.02 million household viewers with a 0.3 in the 18-49 demographics.\n\nCritical reviews\n\"The Day After\" received critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 100% approval rating for the episode, based on 12 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"'The Day After' uses the titular 1983 TV movie as the backdrop for a reflective episode that finds The Americans catching its breath before charging headlong into the end of the season.\"\n\nErik Adams of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"B+\" grade and wrote, \"The morality of The Americans is rarely black-and-white, but the specter of mutually assured destruction has a way of rendering complicated issues into absolutes. After tasting freedom for more than half a year, The Day After brings the psychological toll of the Jennings' work crashing down on Elizabeth. That, and the creeping suspicion that the Young-hee operation is approaching its own point of no return.\"\n\nAlan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \"In that context, you can understand, if in no way condone or forgive, where Elizabeth was coming from when she made the stomach-churning choice she did. Damn, this show is tough. And great.\" Anthony Breznican of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"A big chunk of this episode is dedicated to highlights from the 1983 ABC telemovie The Day After, which explores the aftermath of a nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was disturbing in its day – probably still is. And all the characters in The Americans tune in to watch.\"\n\nMike Hale of The New York Times wrote, \"The best scene in Wednesday night's episode of The Americans on FX was a moving evocation of late-stage Cold War insecurity, as both Americans and Soviets soberly contemplated the reality of an all-out nuclear exchange. But even more powerful was its depiction of the real golden age of television — when more than 100 million people would sit down at the same time on a Sunday night to watch a really scary and depressing TV movie.\" Genevieve Koski of Vulture gave the episode a perfect 5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Philip and Paige aren't the only Jenningses feeling the effects of The Day After. Elizabeth is visibly moved by the TV movie, though it's a little tougher to parse the nuances of her reaction.\"\n\nBen Travers of IndieWire gave the episode a \"B+\" grade and wrote, \"In addition to giving a frightening glimpse of the realities of Cold War America via the TV movie The Day After, 'The Day After' shifted emotional focus from Phillip to Elizabeth, as she faced the harsh reality of her chosen profession.\" Matt Brennan of Slant Magazine wrote, \"For a series in which the 'evil empire,' the Strategic Defense Initiative, The Today Show, and David Copperfield come to the characters via vacuum tubes and radio waves, 'The Day After' is also, fittingly enough, a tribute to the power of television: the foremost medium through which we enjoy, or endure, the experience of being alone together.\"\n\nAlec Bojalad of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Season four of The Americans feels as close to a final season of a TV show that isn't actually a final season as I can remember and 'The Day After' fits in this paradigm perfectly.\" Amy Amatangelo of Paste gave the episode a 8.2 out of 10 and wrote, \"'I'm going to miss her,' Elizabeth tells Philip mournfully about Young Hee.

waterlooin which as in the day after the camera shifts perspectives from seer to seen from tv as mirror to tv as window on the world here of course the effect is bleaker more warning than valediction against bert coopers bravo and harry cranes salute the americans offers only silence stillness but the sense of communion remains in matthews tentative glance toward paige or elizabeths wary look at philip in the very fact that soviet spies and fbi agents consular officials and immigrant families all have skin in this game accelerating alongside the unnerving images of the day after with its mushroom clouds flashes of light and piles of rubble the sequence is terse tense as wideeyed as the characters but it also nods at the notion that everyones fates are inextricably linked as oleg remarks to tatiana this isnt a theoretical notion the soviets inferior technology recently interpreted the reflection of sunlight off clouds as a fusillade of incoming missiles and one officers willingness to defy protocol is all that stood between misinformation and annihilation william expresses similar concerns i dont trust us with it he says to philip of the lhasa virus stored at fort detrick arguing that the intelligence should be kept from the centreadvertisement in essence the day after reexamines the distinctions we draw between offense and defense between the necessary evil and the greater good and arguably comes down on the side of shared understandings renewed détentes do you think it really makes a difference paige asks about her parents work her hopeful mien now burdened to use pastor tims kelly aucoin term by the requirements of tradecraft i dont know philip replies but given the gravity of what hes done in the service of his oncehigh ideals this is no answer at all by contrast elizabeth so insistent that procuring the hemorrhagic fever is a form of selfprotection searches don and young hees house to the bitter whisper of yazs winter kills and ultimately sacrifices the one friendship shes forged in the course of four seasons whatever difference elizabeths staging of a drunken tryst with don may make to the cold wars wider calculus her actions wound her as surely as they will young hee im gonna miss her she confesses to philip verbalizing the tearful grimace that crosses her face as don flees pattys apartment in the context of the day after with its reminder that the shield of nuclear proliferation is in fact the tip of the spear the americans thus questions elizabeths apparent belief that the conflict at hand is a zerosum game after all the chorus of the song that accompanies her betrayal of young hee peter schillings major tom coming home steps back to see earth below usdrifting falling and whats left the day after the wars won by force is universal desolation hello is anybody there a voice in the film cries out as the episode cuts from stan to paige and then finally to elizabeth anybody at alladvertisement share

episode 409 by amy amatangelo  may 12 2016  1256pm tv reviews the americans i vividly remember when the day after aired i was too young and wasnt allowed to watch it my parents didnt want me watching the love boat so a movie about nuclear war was right out but its airing dominated the zeitgeist in a way tv cant now today we have too many channels streaming options and shows for any one tv event to completely take over i loved how the airing of the day after was an undercurrent to all the actiona reminder of how high the stakes truly are when the day after aired on november 30 1983 the threat of imminent nuclear war was frighteningly real i just hope were all together when it happens paige tells her dad and quick its better if we get wiped out straight away more than her peers paige knows nuclear war is possible and feels a personal responsibility about it last weeks time jump brought the breakneck pace the show had been operating under to a screeching halt and the episode floundered a bit as the series struggled to regain its pace elizabeth has done so many bad things by this point in the series drugging young hees husband and sexually assaulting him is definitely in elizabeths wheel house i would expect nothing less from her but what changed is the look of sorrow on elizabeths face clearly young hee filled in elizabeths life what martha filled in phillips through their work they both found someone who understood them and brought them however briefly some sort of happiness even though young hee doesnt know it she and elizabeth both share the experience of being immigrants in the united states raised by strict unforgiving mothers in another life elizabeth and young hee could have been real friends what i truly love about russells portrayal of elizabeth is that i absolutely believe she could do anything at anytime when young hee left her children with elizabeth it crossed my mind that elizabeth could kill them elizabeth puts her country above all else i still fear she could harm paige in many ways elizabeth is a woman becoming unhinged right before our eyes william has another horrific biochemical weaponthis one will liquefy your organs good times he tells philip but wants him not to tell the centre about it i dont trust us with this he tells philip russia struggling compared to the us is a recurring theme our technology is way behind its dangerous oleg tells vera after sharing a story of sunlight being mistaken for nuclear missiles william is disillusioned and aware of the foibles of his own government at least he tells philip the americans have containers that work the day after makes philip think that william is right and they shouldnt turn over the virus but elizabeth ever loyal believes they must give the virus over right away they are making this to destroy us she tells philip the jennings also continue to get in the good graces of pastor tim and his wife philip has arranged pastor tims travel to ethiopia but the good reverend is still worried about paige she seems sad burdened he tells philip throughout the episode philip teaches paige how to drive once again these are the kind of scenes the show excels in its a typical right of passage for every teen yet nothing about the jennings is typical pastor tim likes seeing us together it makes him think were more normal she tells her dad im going to miss her elizabeth tells philip mournfully about young hee with only four episodes left this season im already missing the show stray observations the americansi is the rare tv show where we know theres a lot happening that we simply arent privy to for example philip is clearly still meeting with kimmy and doing heaven knows what else with her but we havent seen her all season at some point that stops becoming an interesting storytelling device and gets a little irritating i need an update on kimmy so oleg and vera are a couple now interesting so funny to see elizabeth stressed over her legitimate job he didnt give a shit how we got the job done as long as we stopped the russians when stan finally figures out who philip really is he is going to need so much therapy do you think this really is the last weve seen of martha im worried about her in russia amy amatangelo the tv gal  is a bostonbased freelance writer a member of the television critics association and a regular contributor to paste she wasnt
