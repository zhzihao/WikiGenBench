{"id": 72162971, "key": "List of beach sports", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%20of%20beach%20sports", "text": "Beach sports are a classification of sport activities which are conducted on a sand surface. They are traditionally associated with being played on a natural, coastal sand beach, but also often take place on artificially constructed in-land playing fields using imported sand. Some beach sports are played on hard, compacted and smooth sand, whilst others are played on soft, loose and uneven sand; a handful are played on both. Many are sand-based adaptations of sports already well established on other surfaces; most are played in smaller playing areas than their parent sports due to the more difficult and exhausting nature of traversing such a yielding terrain. The popularity and range of beach sports has experienced a notable rise since the emergence of pro beach volleyball as a successful commercial venture in the 1980s. Beach sports are practiced from a range of casual and non-competitive to professional-level competition.\n\nThe definition of beach sports is also frequently extended to include water sports conducted in an ocean or similar waterbody, overlooked by an adjacent beach which forms an integral part of the aesthetic and culture of such sports; this list excludes these.\n\nList of beach sports\nThis list is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\nIt is important to note that most of the codified sports below are also frequently complemented by casual manifestations – typically impromptu, improvised, and loose interpretations of their, or their parent sport's, rules and arrangements; self-declared versions of that sport for said session of play by its participants.\n\nAir badminton – derivative of badminton, intended to be played outdoors using a modified shuttlecock on non-conventional surfaces, including sand.\nBeach basketball – derivative of basketball; various permutations and magnitude of departure from parent sport depending on the organising body (sometimes played with one, neutral, backboard-less hoop), but all without dribbling due to the nature of the playing surface and therefore relaxed rules on travelling.\nBeach cricket – derivative of cricket, almost always informally played, with improvised, on the fly rules. However, most games involve no teams (it's the batter versus everyone else and therefore unlimited participants), the batter being obliged to run on any sort of hit, and a hit into the sea being six and out. Usually played on firm sand to aid bowling, using a tennis ball.\nBeach flag football – derivative of flag football (itself a derivative of American football), similar to parent sport but played barefoot, four-a-side, with shorter match lengths and less time for the quarterback to release the ball after the snap.\nBeach flags – Australian lifesaving activity to practice sprinting across soft sand; competitors run towards a limited set of flags wedged into the sand a distance away in an attempt to retrieve one (the concept operates very similar to musical chairs, eliminating one competitor per round by reducing the available flags each time until there is a winner).\nBeach golf – derivative of golf, with a major emphasis on treating all objects present as obstacles (e.g. deckchairs, bathers etc.); a soft polyurethane ball is used to prevent injuries to other beach users.\nBeach handball – derivative of handball, played outdoors with half as many outfield players and virtually no dribbling due to the nature of the playing surface. Matches are contested as best-of-three sets affairs, with the third played as a tiebreaking shootout if needed; extra points are awarded for speciality goals.\nBeach hockey – derivative of field hockey, played five-a-side with a larger ball and using sticks with holes in to allow the sand to pass through; goals are allowed to be scored from anywhere.\nBeach motorsport racing – derivative of motocross; very similar to parent sport but held on tracks marked out on beaches and/or sand dunes, often with the inclusion of man-made sand-jumps.\nBeach polo – derivative of polo; rules operate very similar to parent sport but is played in an enclosed arena with an inflated ball rather than a solid one and with one or two fewer players.\nBeach rugby – derivative of rugby union, usually played six-a-side with a smaller ball and just one point awarded per try; matches are only 10 minutes long and notably lack key features of parent sport such as scrums, line-outs and goalposts.\nBeach soccer – derivative of association football on soft sand, played five-a-side with rolling substitutions, using a lighter ball to be struck barefooted and no offsides. Matches are divided into three 12-minute periods; the clock counts down to zero and is stopped while play is inactive due to fouls and injuries. Matches always end with a winner, going to a penalty shootout if necessary.\nBeach tennis – derivative of lawn tennis, played entirely through vollies due to the ball being unable to bounce on sand; the ball is more depressurized than usual to cause it to travel more slowly and allow for longer rallies. The net is also raised much higher; beach volleyball courts are typically utilised for play. Solid paddle bats are typically used, rather than stringed tennis rackets.\nBeach ultimate – derivative of ultimate frisbee; rules operate very similar to parent sport but most notably is played with fewer players (usually five-a-side, sometimes four).\nBeach volleyball – derivative of volleyball played outdoors on soft sand, using a slightly larger and lighter ball, typically in two teams of two or occasionally four without substitutes, and best of three sets rather than five. Beach attire is a core aesthetic. Currently the only Olympic beach sport.\nBeach wrestling – a stand-up style of wrestling, no ground fighting takes place; three minute matches, first to three points wins, whereby one point is awarded for a takedown or forcing the opponent out of the circle and three points for putting the opponent on their back. It takes place outdoors within a seven-metre diameter sand circle; participants wear beach attire or swimwear.\nBoules – usually a form of pétanque played recreationally by beach-goers in a party game-like fashion on soft or hard sand, frequently with specially, popularly derived coloured plastic balls.\nFootvolley – derivative of beach volleyball, in which players are only allowed to use their feet to touch the ball; a football is also used in place of a volleyball.\nFrescobol – played with solid, traditionally wooden rackets; typically between two players, the non-competitive aim is to maintain an airborne rally with a small rubber ball for as long as possible.\nKite buggying – participants sit in a one-seater, three-wheeled, powerless buggy whilst flying a power kite in front of them to move and steer the vehicle across firm sand.\nKite landboarding – based on kitesurfing, participants ride a mountainboard whilst flying a kite to pull them across firm sand, typically performing tricks similar to skateboarding, both on the ground and aerially; the latter is possible as participants are able to momentarily pull themselves a few metres into the air using the power of the kite's lift.\nMatkot – virtually identical to Frescobol described above, but played with louder, hollower and rounder rackets; the Israeli sport pre-dates its Brazilian counterpart by thirty years.\nNeppis – involves moving a small model car around a miniature race track built into sand by tapping it with a finger; each player takes turns to \"nep\" their car and the first to cross the finish line wins.\nRoundnet – adapted from volleyball, two teams of two surround a small circular trampoline-like net placed on the ground and alternate returning a ball to their opponents via bouncing it off the net within three touches; failure to do so rewards opponents with a point. Played on multiple surfaces, frequently including sand.\nSand yachting – like water sailing, but conducted across firm sand in a three (or sometimes four) wheeled vehicle powered by wind through the use of a sail, and steered by pedals or hand levers; typically involves racing.\nSandboarding – comparable to snowboarding, in which participants attempt to traverse across or down a sand dune while standing freely, or strapped onto, a sandboard.\n\nBeach multi-sport events\nThe worldwide growth of beach sports has given birth to multiple Olympic-style multi-sport events dedicated in large part to beach sports competition (water sports are also usually included). \n\nThe following lists major international beach multi-sport events:\n\nGlobal\nWorld Beach Games (established by ANOC in 2019)\n\nRegional\nAfrican Beach Games (established by ANOCA in 2019)\nAsian Beach Games (established by the OCA in 2008)\nBolivarian Beach Games (established by ODEBO in 2012)\nMediterranean Beach Games (established by the CIJM in 2015)\nSouth American Beach Games (established by ODESUR in 2009)\n\nSee also\nList of ball sports\nList of equestrian sports\nList of racket sports\nList of rural sports and games\nList of water sports\nList of winter sports\nOutdoor recreation\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBeach sports news, at the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC)\n\nBeach sports\nBeach", "unikey": "List of beach sports", "summary": "Beach sports are a classification of sport activities which are conducted on a sand surface.

neverseen event to crossfit competition practised predominantly by surf lifesavers beach flags is a sport which tests reflexes and sprinting ability on sand it involves a series of flags  always one less than the athletes competing  inserted into the sand in a single row competitors start 20 metres away lying with their face down and facing away from the flags after the starting signal athletes turn around and race towards the row of flags to grab hold of one the athlete without a flag is eliminated httpswwwinstagramcompb75djp5a8jnhlen we are proud to host an event in an iconicaussie location and want our programming and spectator experience to make the most of it said ruth blackett media manager at acc this year with our homegrown theme we wanted a test that reflected aussie beach history and required coordination speed and fearless precision beach flags was a natural choice for our expert team the event relies heavily on reaction time agility speed and power and is only planned for individual athletes integrating beach flags into the competition required several months of planning testing and refining to ensure the competition program was assessed holistically its important for an event like this to be an appropriate test said ruth as a sanctional our goal is for our events to ultimately produce winners that are games quality acc are not the first ones to introduce new tests to competition earlier this year crossfit strength in depth tested athletes in a familiar modality with a crucial twist a 500m row on water we have a wonderful group of athletes this year who are up for the test said ruth their reaction to our announcement has been great and we cant wait to see them show off their fitness and test themselves doing something different just under a month until we find out if athletes can  or if they will  dive for the flag the acc will take place in at the gold coast exhibition centre between march 5 and 8 2020 image sources

specific amount of timewith freestyle wrestling wrestlers can use their entire body to pin the opponent and there are minimal limitations both freestyle and beach wrestling allow the use of the legs however beach wrestling is in the standing position so wrestlers who touch the sand aside from the hands lose a pointthe main difference between the two is what qualifies as a winning point while beach wrestling requires a part of the opponents body or the entirety of hisher back touching the sand freestyle requires the wrestler to pin the shoulders to the mat for 12 secondsfolkstyle wrestling

points or pinning the opponent they both also offer points if the other opponent performs an illegal movefolkstyle wrestling consists of three twominute rounds in high school and one threeminute round

"https://missionbeachpetanqueclub.org.au/howto", "how to play petanque facebook 1 the rules of the game are very easy to learn 2 people of all ages can compete on an equal basis 3 its a family bowls game where gender and physical prowess have little impact on success 4 no great strength is needed 5 the bowls are not expensive and last a lifetime 6 playing surface requires very little preparation how to play pétanque although pétanque at tournament level is normally played on a flat speciallyprepared surface the tradition of the game allows a wide variety of surfaces to be pressed into service walkways in public parks are often very suitable as are many school playgrounds and other hardpacked dirt areasthe game can be played albeit less effectively on grass lawns or even on ashphalt with a light dusting of sand just about the only surface that is definitley not suitable is a sandy beach however  special light plastic beach pétanque balls can be obtained to make beach play possible the game is played between two competing teams the size of each team can vary from one mano a mano style to three thus any group of people numbering between two and perhaps six can enjoy a game the most usual team makeups are two against two doublettes and three against three triplettes in doublettes each player plays three boules and in triplettes two so the total number of boules in the game is almost always twelve so youve selected your location got some friends together with some regulation boules and hopefully a regulation cochonnet what now well you need one final item of equipment  a coin to toss to see which team goes first a player of the team winning the toss selects a starting place and scratches a circle in the ground officially 35 to 50 centimeters diameter they then toss the cochonnet a distance of from six to ten meters in any direction however it is technically invalid if it ends up less than half a meter from any wall tree or other obstacle the game proper starts when a player of the first team standing with both feet in the circle throws a boule and attempts to place it as near as possible to the cochonnet preferably between him and the cochonnet there is no restriction on how the boule is thrown with the exception that both feet must remain in the circle until the boule has touched the ground typically the boule is thrown underarm with the palm facing backwards this method is considered to provide more accuracy and imparts necessary backspin to stop the heavy boule from rolling too far after the first bounce this method of throw is most suited to accurate positioning of or pointing the boule to drive or shoot the opponents boule out of the game usually involves a throw with a lower trajectory in some cases rolling the boule completely along the ground is an equally valid legal throw the second team must then play until at least one of its boules is closer to the cochonnet than the first teams boule this can be accomplished either by more accurate placing of a boule or by violently shooting the adversary boule out of the game by impact assuming the second team achieves this before running out of boules the first team then plays until successful or out of boules and so on alternately until all the boules of both teams have been played if the cochonnet is displaced the game continues unless the cochonnet either goes outside an agreed perimeter or cannot be seen from the circle in thatcase the round is annulled and restarted however if the cochonnet is knocked away when one team has thrown all its boules and the other team still has boules in hand the team with the boules earns one point for each one that it has not played when both teams have thrown all their boules the round is complete and the points are determined the winning team receives one point for each boule closer than any boule of the opposing team thus the maximum possible score in any one round is normally six a player of the team winning the round again throws the cochonnet and another round begins the game usually ends when one team has accumulated 13 points pétanque equipment check the only really ssential equipment is a set of three steel boules a set costs anywhere from us5 for a rusty old set you may be lucky enough to come across to us120 for a competition set to be legitimate for competition play a boule must conform to the following specifications weight from 650 to 800 grams diameter from 705 to 800mm a player who specialises in pointing or placing should normally favor a small heavy boule a heavy boule is slightly more difficult to displace and a boule of the minimum allowable diameter presents a smaller target to the oppositions shooters women and young boys usually having smaller hands and less arm strength frequently compromise by selecting a boule that is both light and small desirable but nonessential equipment a cochonnet a steel tape measure preferably in centimeters a proper cochonnet is turned from beech wood and is between 25 cm and 35 cm in diameter in the south of france the home of pétanque a cochonnet can be bought for very small change indeed it may help to have a brightlycolored cochonnet especially in conditions of low light but the rules specify that a cochonnet may be stained but not painted very nonessential equipment as with all sports equipment shops will try and sell

wenna para o eu atleta  tel avivyafo 15012021 08h00 atualizado 15012021 esporte genuinamente brasileiro que se originou nas praias do rio de janeiro em meados do século passado e se espalhou por toda a costa do país o frescobol é conhecido como uma modalidade em que não existe competição bastam duas raquetes uma bolinha e muita vontade de não deixar a bola cair entusiasta da atividade o escritor e jornalista millôr fernandes chegou a definilo como o único esporte com espírito esportivo sem disputa formal vencidos ou vencedores o que millôr talvez não imaginasse é que há pelo menos três décadas existe também o frescobol competitivo sem deixar de lado a filosofia colaborativa que o consagrou para explicar o eu atleta conversou com o treinador marcelo silva o marcelinho campeão mundial de frescobol em 2017 mas vamos também falar sobre os benefícios da modalidade não competitiva um exercício aeróbico que é a cara desse verão da pandemia afinal embora seja um esporte de praia o frescobol pode ser praticado em qualquer lugar até mesmo no quintal ou dentro de casa  futevôlei regras benefícios e dicas de alimentação e suplementação futmesa benefícios e regras da modalidade que invadiu as

 foto istock getty images  o frescobol competitivo existe com um circuito nacional desde a década de 90 naquela época os atletas recebiam os convites em casa por carta ao longo destes quase 30 anos de competições as regras passaram por diversas mutações sendo a maioria delas regionais o brasil tem mais de 7000 km de praia então ao longo de toda a costa tem muita cultura diferente estilos diferentes e informação chegando diferente em cada local no início dos anos 2000 houve um congresso técnico para unificar as regras nacionais mas as adaptações regionais acontecem até hoje  conta marcelinho 39 anos sendo 25 dedicados às competições apesar das diferenças de região para região algumas características não mudam nas competições de frescobol não existe confronto entre os competidores o atleta joga com seu parceiro mantendo a mesma ideia de colaboração da versão recreativa que surgiu na metade do século passado sempre com o objetivo de não deixar a bola cair as duplas se apresentam em turnos e recebem uma pontuação a exemplo do que acontecem em alguns esportes olímpicos como o nado sincronizado e a ginástica artística ou outro esporte colaborativo de praia também nascido no rio de janeiro a altinha  é um confronto indireto o frescobol como competição não deixa de lado a filosofia da parceria da colaboração da importância de cuidar do outro de entender e de doar para o outro  explica marcelinho  protetor solar como escolher e usar o filtro ideal para rosto e corpo como funciona a pontuação no frescobol 2 de 3criado no rio de janeiro o frescobol se popularizou brasil afora  foto istock getty images criado no rio de janeiro o frescobol se popularizou brasil afora  foto istock getty images para jogar são necessárias duas raquetes de madeira ou algum tipo de polímero como fibra de vidro e uma bolinha de borracha mesmo com as regras regionais a pontuação se baseia sobre os mesmos quesitos principais continuidade do jogo seguindo o princípio básico do frescobol quanto menos a bola cair no chão é melhor o mais comum são cinco minutos de jogo para cada dupla com paralisação do cronômetro a cada vez que a bola cai em que a partir da oitava bola perdida cada queda é punida com a perda de 600 pontosvelocidade da bola através de um radar de velocidade esportiva semelhante ao usado para a medição de saques no tênis é aferida a velocidade com que a bola viaja de uma raquete a outra e a partir disto a dupla soma os respectivos pontos acima de determinadas velocidades de corte também existem multiplicadores que aumentam a pontuação proporcional desta forma uma bola de 65kmh valeria 65 pontos assim como uma desferida a 68kmh valeria 68 pontos já um lance de 77kmh teria o valor de 85 pontos pois velocidades a cima de 70kmh recebem um multiplicador de 11equilíbrio ou o quão próximo está o número de ataques aplicado à bola por cada um dos membros da dupla  antigamente era comum ter um especialista de defesa e um de ataque hoje é necessário que os dois ataquem o radar afere a bola indo e voltando para determinar quem está atacando estes dados são processados pelo software que calcula quantas vezes cada um atacou e esta diferença pode ser de até dez ataques se eu ataquei 100 e você 92 a gente não perde nenhum ponto de equilíbrio já se um atacar 100 e o outro 80 a dupla perde 600 pontos 60 por cada bola excedente  explica marcelinho benefícios e queima de calorias 3 de 3marcelinho silva joga frescobol faz 25 anos e há cinco virou também treinador  foto reprodução instagram marcelinho silva joga frescobol faz 25 anos e há cinco virou também treinador  foto reprodução instagram com a chegada do verão é comum que os brasileiros pratiquem mais esportes de praia como o frescobol jogado ao ar livre e com companhia pode ser para muitos uma alternativa mais divertida à academia não há contato físico e os participantes ficam a uma distância segura um do outro o que pode ser ideal em meio à pandemia de covid19 jogado em uma intensidade de média para alta uma partida de frescobol ajuda a queimar 1200 calorias em cerca de 40 minutos além de possuir uma fácil adaptabilidade para diferentes idades veja benefícios ajuda a emagrecer ao promover um bom gasto calóricoé um exercício aeróbico que trabalha a capacidade cardiorrespiratóriaestimula o equilíbrio e as funções cognitivas trabalha diferentes grupos musculares especialmente os a seguir nessa ordem membros inferiores glúteo abdômen e em menor intensidade braços peitoral e costas  é muito comum as pessoas me procurarem dizendo que querem treinar frescobol mas têm medo de ficar com um braço mais forte que o outro se você treinar da forma certa com alguém que entenda de biomecânica simetriologia e fisiologia vai ver que não é só braço muito pelo contrário  aponta o treinador  os músculos mais utilizados são os das pernas com uma base estável você consegue transferir energia do seu corpo para a raquete assim como no tênis o trabalho de perna é bastante importante para evitar lesões sobretudo para quem está começando é importante estar atento a dois pontos principais respeitar seus limites físicos para não forçar além da conta e executar os movimentos e postura de maneira correta as lesões iniciais mais comuns são justamente as nas costas por má postura no joelho por uso de um centro de gravidade inadequado nos ombros por repetição de movimentos errados com excesso de amplitude desnecessária e de cotovelo ou punho quando o atleta segura a raquete de forma errada  um dos principais cuidados para evitar lesões tanto no frescobol como qualquer outra atividade de média ou alta intensidade é você entender e respeitar os seus limites iniciais não adianta ver um cara jogando muito e querer imitar na primeira vez a evolução seja física ou técnica vai acontecer com o tempo a maioria das lesões está atribuída a você iniciar da forma errada continuar da forma errada e intensificar da forma errada o corpo humano se adapta à dor então o cara sofre mas se acostuma a jogar com dor e continua jogando errado  explica marcelinho ele completa que o próprio parceiro pode causar a lesão se jogar bolas ruins muitas vezes seguidas obrigando o outro a repetir muitas vezes um movimento errado  a lesão de côndilo que é muito comum em jogador de esportes de raquete acontece pela sobrecarga do cotovelo com você esticando o braço 100 200 vezes para pegar a bola cabe a você se adaptar ajustando o movimento para evitar a lesão isto se aprende com o tempo com orientação técnica para se antecipar e não precisar esticar tanto o cotovelo por exemplo  comenta frescobol em casa na pandemia com a pandemia da covid19 e as recomendações de isolamento social o verão de 2021 será diferente de todos os outros podendo trazer restrições à frequentação das praias pelo país praticado ao ar livre à distância e com poucas pessoas o frescobol é mais seguro que uma série de outras atividades em tempos de coronavírus e mesmo em caso de fechamentos pode ser facilmente adaptado para quintais ou varandas ou ainda praticado com exercícios específicos dentro de casa para este último caso o treinador recomenda a utilização de uma bola de treino feita de espuma ao invés da bolinha de raquetebol usada em competições para não quebrar objetos dentro de casa e estimula os atletas a se superarem através de desafios individuais com a raquete como no vídeo acima  meus treinos são muito pautados nos desafios eu quero que as pessoas se superem acreditem que são capazes e vejam como é gostoso quando elas conseguirem vão se sentir muito felizes e aprimorar o desafio você pode fazer 30 40 minutos de desafio e vai estar aprimorando tecnicamente se divertindo se superando e fazendo bem para o corpo e para a mente  diz marcelinho que ensina um desafio para os leitores segure a raquete igual a um martelo com as faces na vertical e o corpo fazendo um ângulo de 4560º com o solojogue a bolinha na parede e pegue com a mão contando até 10 se ela cair a contagem zeraapós conseguir dez
