The season premiered on July 6, 2022, on CBS in the United States and Global in Canada. Hosted by Julie Chen Moonves, the show follows a group of contestants (known as HouseGuests), who live in a house together while being constantly filmed and having no communication with the outside world as they compete to win a grand prize of .\n\nThe season ran for 82 days, ending on September 25, 2022. Taylor Hale was crowned the winner, defeating Monte Taylor. Hale became the first black female HouseGuest to win, as well as the second black HouseGuest to win in the main edition of the show. She was also voted America's Favorite HouseGuest, becoming the first winner to also claim this prize. On September 25, 2022, CBS renewed the series for a twenty-fifth season.\n\nFormat \nBig Brother follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who live inside a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered with no contact with the outside world. During their stay, the HouseGuests share their thoughts on their day-to-day lives inside the house in a private room known as the Diary Room. Each week, the HouseGuests compete in competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in a Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HOH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and selects two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Six HouseGuests are then selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH, the nominees, and three other HouseGuests chosen by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition has the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. On eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the nominees, though the Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote. This vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie, the Head of Household casts the tie-breaking vote. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests comprise the Jury and are sequestered in a separate location following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury is only allowed to see the competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; they are not shown any interviews or other footage that might include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize by choosing \"America's Favorite HouseGuest.\" All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntarily leave or are forcibly removed for rule violations.\n\nHouseGuests \n\nThe HouseGuests for the twenty-fourth season were revealed on July 5, 2022. US Weekly published a series of cast interviews on the same day. Prior to the reveal, CBS aired a teaser featuring various voice clips from the HouseGuests. The cast includes Miss Michigan USA 2021 and Miss USA 2021 competitor Taylor Hale. Marvin Achi, a 28-year-old from Houston, Texas, was among the sixteen HouseGuests initially slated to be on the season, but was removed from the cast and replaced by Joseph Abdin.\n\nFuture appearances \nAmeerah Jones, Alyssa Snider, and Monte Taylor all competed on the second season of The Challenge: USA.\n\nEpisodes\n\nTwists\n\nBackstage Boss \nOn Night 1, one HouseGuest randomly selected the Backstage Boss Pass. This player would be granted immunity for the week, but could not be nominated, lost eligibility to participate in the week's competitions, and could not vote on eviction night. This player also had to choose three other HouseGuests to join them Backstage. These HouseGuests would also be safe from nomination, lost eligibility to participate in the week's competitions, and could not vote on eviction night. However, the three Backstage HouseGuests were not granted immunity and would still be eligible for eviction. On eviction night, the HouseGuest evicted by the house would have gone in a head-to-head battle against one of the Backstage HouseGuests. An online public vote was held for America to grant one of the three Backstage HouseGuests immunity from eviction for the week. The loser of the competition between the house evictee and the selected Backstage HouseGuest would immediately become evicted.\n\nPooch ended up claiming the Backstage Boss Pass and as a result was required to select three HouseGuests to join him Backstage. Pooch selected Alyssa, Brittany, and Paloma to join him. Brittany won the majority of the public vote and would have been granted immunity for the week had the twist not been cancelled. Since Paloma chose to leave the game, the twist was cancelled.\n\nFestie Besties \nStarting in Week 3, the HouseGuests competed in sets, similarly to the Duos Twist in season 13. The HouseGuest who was named Head of Household earned immunity for their Besties, and was obligated to nominate another set of Besties for eviction. Three sets of Besties would compete for the Power of Veto: the HOH's set, the nominated set, and another set selected by random draw. Only one person from the winning set needed to decide to use the Power of Veto in order to save the nominated set of Besties. Should that happen, the entire set of Besties would be saved, forcing the HoH to nominate another set as replacements. After each eviction, the surviving Bestie chose a new set of Besties to join. The sets are listed below.\n\nSplit House Double Eviction \nFollowing Week 6's eviction, the house was split into two groups of five that had no interaction for the entire week. The winner of the HOH competition became the HOH for Big BroChella, occurring in the house, while the second place finisher became HOH of Dyre Fest, occurring outside. The remaining houseguests were split via a school yard pick by the respective HOHs. A full week of events played out for each group, with their own competitions, nominations, and evictions. Ultimately, two HouseGuests were evicted at the end of Week 7. The groups are listed below:\n\nVoting history \nColor key:\n\nNotes\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment \n\nBig Brother 24 is co-produced by production companies Endemol Shine North America and Fly On The Wall Entertainment. The season was first confirmed following the conclusion of the previous season in a joint announcement that also confirmed that Celebrity Big Brother would be revived for a third season. Host Julie Chen Moonves returned for the season along with Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan who serve as executive producers. Casting for the season started in February 2022 and concluded sometime around June 2022. As had been the case since Big Brother 22, open-call auditions were not held for this season. Jesse Tannenbaum returned to head the casting efforts for Big Brother 24.\n\nOn June 1, 2022, CBS announced that the season would premiere on July 6, 2022, with confirmation on June 15, 2022, of a 90-minute live premiere. Prior to the season premiere, it was widely speculated that live audiences would return in a full capacity following two seasons of absence due to previous pandemic restrictions. While the premiere and first five evictions took place behind closed doors, a live audience returned for the remainder of the season, starting with the live eviction on August 18, 2022. Key art for the season was released on June 15, 2022.\n\nPrize \nThe winner of the series, determined by the previously evicted HouseGuests, wins  while the runner-up receives . The HouseGuest selected as America's Favorite HouseGuest receives .\n\nProduction design \n\nThe house is located at the Radford Studio Center in Los Angeles, California. As with previous seasons, the house is outfitted with 94 HD cameras and more than 113 microphones. Photos and a video tour of the house were released by CBS on July 5, 2022. Alternatively known as the \"BB Motel\", Julie Chen Mooves described the house's theme as a \"colorful, desert oasis inspired by Palm Springs, and a blast from the past, mid-century style.\" A golf-themed bedroom has mini golf cart models lined along the walls, with the beds with headboards composed of AstroTurf. A second bedroom is decorated with details alluding to the car designs of the 1950s, including portraits of the car designs and beds with headboards composing of vintage car dashboards. The Space Age-themed bedroom features hanging models of Venus, Earth and Saturn. The Have-Not room resembles a drained pool, with a slide and inflatables being placed on the room.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\nMistreatment of Taylor Hale \nFollowing the launch of the show's live feeds, a majority of the HouseGuests received criticism for their behavior towards Taylor Hale. Viewers noted multiple lies made about Hale, along with several comments that displayed racially charged microaggressions, acts of colorism, conscious bias, and unconscious assumptions regarding Hale's appearance and personality.\n\nJulie Chen Moonves weighed in. \"Microaggressions are real and they happen. I don't think most people, when they are committing it, that they are even aware of what they're doing. I think that with the live feeds it is easy,\" Chen said. \"I think what we need to do is ask ourselves, 'Who am I — who is anyone — to judge somebody else?'\". She also addressed those that were critical of the HouseGuests on social media: \"It's so interesting that you use the term 'mob mentality.' Because isn't that what Twitter has done? Aren't you all being hypocrites? There has been this mob mentality created against people in the house, who viewers feel have not been kind to Taylor. I think anytime you're nominated, it'll bring you to tears... It hurts. It hurts and I have sympathy for her. I have sympathy for everyone in that house. It's not easy\".\n\nDaniel Durston's outburst and disparaging comments towards Taylor Hale were heavily criticized by the viewer audience. Featured on episode 9, Durston verbally attacked Hale in defense of Nicole Layog, who misinterpreted Hale's support of her emotional breakdown as a hint to quit the game. After Layog vented about the situation to the other HouseGuests, Durston confronted a confused Hale and accused her of causing HouseGuest Paloma Aguilar's exit from the show. Blaming Hale for Aguilar's mental health, Durston tells Hale, \"You can f*** right off\" and not to talk to him until the show's live finale. The confrontation brought Hale to tears with no one to publicly defend her. Prior to his outburst, Durston was also criticized for claiming, according to the live feeds, that Taylor isn't a good person and she \"doesn't deserve to live normal.\" After his eviction during Week 5, Durston addressed his treatment of Hale in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \"Leaving the house, obviously it sits terrible with me. That's not how I want to be portrayed,\" Durston said. He also claimed that he would watch the show back to \"correct [his] wrongs.\"\n\nKyle Capener's racial optics \nViewers criticized Kyle Capener for attempting to create a racial divide among the contestants. During Week 4's live footage, Capener expressed fear in a potential alliance developing between the minorities in the house, labeling them as \"Cookout 2.0.\", referring to Big Brother 23s all-black six-person alliance.\n\nJulie Chen Moonves addressed Capener's comments, deeming them as \"game paranoia\". She states, \"You also have to remember, [Hale] told her whole alliance she would not nominate [Davis] because she refuses to part of evicting another Black woman. That might have steered [Capener]'s mind into thinking what if there is a secret alliance like the Cookout this season. Beyond that, I don't think there's much more to it.\"\n\nViewing figures\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n  – official American site\n  – official Canadian site\n \n\n2022 American television seasons\n24\nTelevision controversies in the United States\nRace-related controversies in television", "unikey": "Big Brother 24 (American season)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Format", "HouseGuests", "Episodes", "Twists", "Voting_history", "Production", "Reception", "References", "External_links"], "contents": ["Big Brotherfollows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who live inside a custom-built house outfitted with cameras and microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day.The HouseGuests are sequestered with no contact with the outside world.During their stay, the HouseGuests share their thoughts on their day-to-day lives inside the house in a private room known as the Diary Room.Each week, the HouseGuests compete in competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house.

ortega skinbaring dressbest movies of 20232024 upcoming movies television big brother season 24 has a release date but there might be one big unfortunate change news by mick joest published 1 june 2022 fans might be disappointed if this is true the summer is fast approaching and its arrival means the return of big brother to cbs season 24 officially has a premiere date of wednesday july 6 and will precede the premiere of a special season of the challenge usa so its sure to be a big night unfortunately theres no mention so far of one very popular element of recent big brother premieres and its possible that season 24 wont have a live moveinthe initial announcement for big brother season 24s 90minute premiere features no mention of a live movein event cinemablend spoke to a cbs representative about the live movein but they were unsure about whether or not it would happen suffice to say losing it would be a big blow to the fans who grew to love all the perks that went along with itthe live movein was originally featured in big brother over the top which was exclusive to paramount subscribers cbs big brother first introduced live moveins with season 22 and despite one snafu on that premiere night brought it back for season 23the biggest perk of a live movein from a fan perspective is that viewers get to see the exact moment the game starts in previous seasons and even the more recent celebrity big brother season 3 houseguests would have days to maybe even a week before live feeds began to get acclimated as well as form alliancesmissing out on that time creates a large time gap where viewers have to catch up on what happened which can lead to confusing situations they dont have the context for one big example would be all the controversy from celebrity big brother season 3 regarding mirai nagasu which we may never get the full story behindit was also because of the live movein and night of live feeds that fans got to see season 23s brandon frenchie french go off the rails with possibly the most chaotic head of household that the game had ever seen in previous seasons that didnt have live moveins we wouldve seen all that chaos unfold throughout brief clips to fill the hour which can never possibly due justice to most situationsthe live movein has shown that sometimes the most exciting part of big brother is the very beginning also dedicated fans like watching the live feeds for as long as they possibly can so its ideal if theyre up as close to the start of the game as possibleas for other details about big brother season 24 episodes during the season will air on sundays and wednesdays at 800 pm et with live eviction episodes on thursdays at 900 pm et the cast is also referred to as allnew which would presumably mean not to expect returning cast members this season more details on the season will come later on hopefully including news of a live moveinbig brother season 24 arrives on cbs with a 90minute premiere on wednesday july 6 at 800 pm et be sure to stick around afterward for the premiere of the challenge usa which is one of many new shows coming over the next few months cinemablend newsletteryour daily blend of

against the treatment of taylor hale by other houseguests many members of season 23s the cookout alliance  the first allblack alliance to make it to the final six  took to twitter to share their disgust over the multiple comments made behind hales back by paloma aguilar and other houseguests hale has been referred to as aggressive and some have assumed she will have a temper tantrum if she doesnt get her away on the shows live feeds hale was shown crying alone in a room and some cast members have stated that they didnt like her from the moment they saw her season 23 winner xavier prather shared a lengthy statement via twitter following the premiere noting that this treatment is why the famous alliance was created in the first place members of the black community especially black women and other people of color stand no chance in the big brother house due to perpetuation of microaggressions and unconscious biases which plague our society he wrote i acknowledge my shortcomings during my time on big brother and cant help but feel partially responsible for some of the reprehensible behavior i see being exhibited by current houseguests who consider me one of their favorites for that id like to apologize for being an accessory to any ongoing issues ive tried to learn from my conduct and educate myself so that i can stand beside those who need my support as i attempt to do for taylor now in the future i hope it doesnt take a cookout for any black houseguests or any poc houseguest to finally escape the feeling of being ostracized within the big brother house for simply existing change is a must cookout member azah awasum also joined the conversation i see questions on my timeline showing some confusion over what taylor is experiencing giving the definition of colorism for context colorismprejudice or discrimination against individuals with a dark skin tone typically among people of the same ethnic or racial group she wrote i made a cognizant effort to dial back in the house for these exact reason dark skinned women always have this in the back of our heads cbs teaches about racial microagressions but a section on colorism would be beneficial taylors light will shine outside this house trending tv comments most popular oppenheimer leads critics choice awards with 8 wins barbie scores 6  full winners list chelsea handler goes

chicago fire boss teases tension between stellaride jesse spencers return and kara killmer and alberto rosendes emotional exits 4 days ago see all getty  cbs julie chen moonves has weighed in on the controversy surrounding season 24 of big brother during thursdays episode of es daily pop the host of the cbs reality show was asked about the microaggressions that are going on inside the house this season against contestant taylor hale microaggressions are real and they happen i dont think most people when they are committing it that they are even aware of what theyre doing i think that with the live feeds it is easy chen said i think what we need to do is ask ourselves who am i  who is anyone  to judge somebody else the host who has been part of the reality show since its 2000 debut noted that viewers havent walked in their shoes or lived inside the house since the seasons start last week many viewers past big brother contestants and even a casting producer have called out the cast for making comments about hale calling her aggressive and bullying her for no reason many even said they didnt like her from the moment they saw her and claimed theyre worried that she will blow up at them if she gets nominated in a separate interview with parade magazine chen responded to the twitter outcry what i think has been a little bit surprising is how twitter and the internet has exploded in really jumping on someone which i never like i dont think any of us are in any position to judge any other human being she said what i think taylor has experienced in the house and what weve seen on the live feeds are separate from each other a lot of it has been classic big brother trash talk behind someones back because you feel threatened by them in many ways big brother is like high school on steroids and if you were to ask taylor you know prior to becoming a replacement nominee she simply was not aware of how much jealousy there was so i would say lets all take a pause lets try not to judge please leave the judging to the judge father god and lets exercise some compassion for one another we dont know what its like to go through that big brother house have some mercy and some grace and some forgiveness and if someone can come out of the house sees what their actions were in the house and learns something from it and is humbled by the whole experience then hallelujah thats a

pudding had nothing to do with wangs ethnicity whatsoeverin 2020 cbs announced that it was requiring at least 50 percent of its reality show cast members to be black indigenous and people of color the
