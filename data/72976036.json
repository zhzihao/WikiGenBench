{"id": 72976036, "key": "Nduga hostage crisis", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nduga%20hostage%20crisis", "text": "The Nduga hostage crisis began on 7 February 2023 when Free Papua Movement (, OPM) insurgents attacked a plane and took its pilot and all five passengers hostage. While the passengers were soon released, New Zealander pilot Philip Mark Mehrtens remains in captivity.\n\nBackground \nOn 4 February 2023 fifteen civilian workers building a puskesmas clinic for the district had been threatened by the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which alleged that some of them were spies of the Indonesian government, as some of them were allegedly not carrying their national identity cards.\n\nTimeline\n\nFirst week\nOn 7 February 2023 at 06:17 a.m. WIT, a Pilatus PC-6 Porter aircraft with the registration number PK-BVY belonging to Susi Air arrived from Timika to Paro airport, Nduga. Shortly after landing, it lost contact with air traffic control. A search was conducted from the air, which soon sighted a burning aircraft. The fate of the New Zealander pilot and the Indonesian passengers (local Nduga Papuan; Demanus Gwijangge, Minda Gwijangge, Pelenus Gwijangge, Meita Gwijangge and an infant, Wetina W) was not known at this point.\n\nA few hours after the sighting, Indonesian military stated that it is likely that the passengers had been taken hostage by the OPM, who were also accused of setting the plane on fire. On the same day, OPM spokesman Sebby Sambom confirmed these allegations, claiming that the operation was led by Egianus Kogoya, a local commander. OPM stated that the passengers, who were Indonesian nationals, had already been released, but that the pilot would only be delivered if the Indonesian government recognised the independence of West Papua, and otherwise would be killed. By then, the hostage had been taken further away from the area according to the organisation. OPM considered New Zealand, Indonesia, Australia, Europe, and the United States to be responsible. In addition, OPM took hostage the workers who had been building the puskesmas clinic.\n\nBy 8 February, civilian workers had been evacuated from the area by the Indonesian National Police. Units of police and army were deployed to evacuate the fifteen civilian workers with three helicopters. The evacuation operation was slowed down by bad weather and had to be suspended, but was later completed. In the evening of 8 February, the police claimed that all passengers of the plane had been evacuated.\n\nOn 8 February the Indonesian Ministry of Transportation closed the airport down as the remains of the burned aircraft could not be moved and were blocking the runway. On the same day Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Yudo Margono stated that previously they have warned Susi Air to not conduct flights to Nduga as the area is dangerous with minimal security forces. He also claimed not to have known that Susi Air had been regularly flying to Nduga.  This despite Susi Air having flown regular, scheduled flights to Paro and nearby Kilmid for years on a government contract for subsidized air services.\n\nIn the days following Mehrten's kidnapping, the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) deployed two battalions of the elite special forces Kopassus' Unit 81 counter-terrorism force to the southern Papuan city of Timika, which became a staging post for the rescue operation. The Indonesians evacuated thousands of people from around Paro airport, Nduga Regency, Lanny Jaya Regency, and Puncak in an effort to deny Kogoya's group community assistance. In addition, Indonesian troops blocked key positions in the Central Highlands in order to prevent Kogoya's brother Undinus from assisting Kogoya's group.\n\nSecond week\nOn 14 February, members of the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), the armed wing of the OPM, released several photos and videos of the New Zealand pilot Phillip Mark Mehrtens to the Associated Press. The rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom stated that his group had released the five civilian hostages since they were indigenous Papuans. In their videos, the rebels reiterated their demand for West Papuan independence.\n\nOn 14 February, Indonesian coordinating minister for Political, Security and Legal Affairs Mohammad Mahfud confirmed that the Indonesian Government was working to secure Mehrtens' release and reiterated that West Papua was part of Indonesia. Papua police chief Mathius Fakhiri also confirmed that local authorities were working with tribal and religious community leaders to negotiate with the rebels.\n\nThat same week, an Indonesian military spokesperson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that Indonesian security forces were working to identify Mehrtens' exact location before attempting to rescue him. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) confirmed that it was working with the Indonesian Government and other agencies to secure Mehrens' release and stated that his family had asked for privacy.\n\nBy 17 February, Papua Police chief Inspector Matthius Fakhiri issued a statement that it believed they had identified the location where Mehrten was being held hostage. Papua Police dispatched a negotiation team consisting of local politicians to make contact with TPNPB forces.\n\nThird week\nOn 23 February, Indonesian authorities claimed that Kogoya had offered to exchange firearms and ammunition for Mehrtens' release, and that the offer had been rejected.\n\nOn 24 February, the United Liberation Movement for West Papua's (ULMWP) leader Benny Wenda called for Mehrten's captors to release him.\n\nIn late February 2023, Deakin University Emeritus Professor Damien Kingsbury was authorised by the TPNPB to serve as their intermediary with the New Zealand Government due to his previous work with Free Papuan groups. As intermediary, Kingsbury regularly liaised with a New Zealand Police hostage negotiator. Kingsbury's involvement in the hostage negotiation process ceased around late May 2023 after the New Zealand Government decided to use a new communication channel. The TPNPB did not accept this change of communication channel.\n\nMarch 2023\nOn 1 March, Indonesian chief security minister Mahfud MD confirmed that Indonesian security forces had found the location of Kogoya's group but would refrain from conducting actions that might endanger the life of hostage Mehrtens.\n\nOn 9 March, Senior Commander Faizal Ramadani, the Head of Cartenz Peace Operation, confirmed that Kogoya's group had rejected peace negotiations with the Indonesian authorities.\n\nOn 10 March, the West Papua Liberation Army released a second video by Mehrtens urging foreign pilots to avoid flying and working in Highland Papua until West Papua is independent.\n\nBy 17 March, Kogoya's men, still with Mehrtens, had retreated into West Papua's Central Highlands. Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Admiral Yudo Margono reiterated Indonesian authorities' commitment towards a peaceful solution, but declined an offer from New Zealand Ambassador Kevin Burnett to facilitate low-level negotiations between OPM intermediaries, local district officials and religious leaders. According to the Indonesian Police, Kogoya killed an eight-year-old boy after the child's father, a local village head, had refused to supply the group with food.\n\nOn 22 March, Radio New Zealand reported that Jeffery Bomanak, the chair of the Free Papua Movement, stated that the group was willing to negotiate with both the Indonesian Government and the West Papua Liberation Army to secure the safe release of Mehrtens. Bomanak also urged Indonesia not to launch any military operations that could endanger Mehrtens' life.\n\nOn 23 March, Indonesian security forces launched an offensive against the West Papua Liberation Army group holding Mehrtens captive, prompting a response by the West Papuan Liberation Army. The West Papuan Liberation Army condemned the attack as a violation of the New Zealand Government's request for non-violence. The Liberation Army claimed that one of its members had perished during the attack and claimed to have shot four Indonesian security personnel, killing one soldier and a police officer.\n\nApril 2023 \nOn 12 April, a member of an armed criminal group involved in the hostage crisis has been arrested by Cartenz Peace Operation.\n\nOn 17 April, Stuff reported that members of the West Papua Liberation Army had attacked 36 Indonesian soldiers at a post in Nduga Regency (Mugi-Mam districts, 100 km north of Paro). At least six soldiers were killed and 21 others fled into the jungle. Nine soldiers were reportedly held captive by the rebels on 15 April. Papua military spokesperson Colonel Herman Taryaman confirmed that the soldiers were part of a group searching for Mehrtens and that Indonesian authorities were searching for about 30 missing soldiers. Rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom stated that the West Papua Liberation Army's fighters had carried out the attack in retaliation for the killing of two rebels during a shootout with Indonesian security forces in March 2023. Sambon called on the Indonesian Government to halt its military operations in West Papua in return for negotiations with the Indonesian and New Zealand governments, and claimed thirteen Indonesian soldiers killed in the engagement.\n\nOn 18 April, TNI Commander Yudo Margono confirmed four Indonesian soldiers killed, one missing, five wounded, and 26 in good condition with no injury. On 23 April, the last missing soldier was confirmed dead.\n\nOn 26 April, Mehrtens' captors released a video statement by Mehrtens stating he was alive and well. Mehrtens also called upon the Indonesian Army to stop bombing the area to avoid endangering him. He claimed that he was being well-treated by his captors. Mehrtens also appeared to be wearing restraints around his neck and wrist.\n\nMay 2023 \nOn 26 May, a new video by Mehrtens' captors was released, in which, Mehrtens revealed new information that if secession talks did not begin with Indonesia \"within two months, then they say they will shoot me.\" New Zealand's foreign ministry commented that they were working closely with Indonesian authorities and deploying consular staff, to ensure a \"peaceful resolution\" and Mehrtens \"safe release\".\n\nAugust 2023 \nOn 9 August, New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins called for the immediate release of Mehrtens, stating that his safety was the top priority and that the six-month milestone was difficult for his family.\n\nReferences\n\n2023 in international relations\n2023 crimes in Indonesia\nConflicts in 2023\nFebruary 2023 events in Indonesia\nHostage taking in Indonesia\nKidnappings in Indonesia\nPapua conflict\nIndonesia–New Zealand relations\nHistory of Highland Papua", "unikey": "Nduga hostage crisis", "summary": " Indonesia\n", "outlines": ["Background", "Timeline", "Indonesian_military_casualties", "Notes", "References"], "contents": ["On 4 February 2023, fifteen civilian workers building apuskesmasclinic for theDistrict of Parowere threatened by theFree Papua Movement(OPM), which alleged that some of them were spies of theIndonesian government, as some of them were allegedly not carrying theirnational identity cards.\n", "### First week\nOn 7 February 2023 at 06:17a.m.WIT, aPilatus PC-6 Porteraircraft with the registration number PK-BVYbelonging toSusi Airarrived fromTimikato Paro airport, Nduga.
