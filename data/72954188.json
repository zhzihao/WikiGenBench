These institutions are run by individual states. These state schools were and are famous for abuse and neglect. In many states, the residents were involuntary sterilized during the eugenics era. Many states have closed state schools as part of the deinstitutionalisation movement.\n\nHistory\n\nHopes of reformers \nMany progressive reformers in the mid-1800s noticed the horrible conditions experienced by people with disabilities and wanted to improve them. Many people with disabilities were put in prison or poorhouses.\n\nDorothea Dix described:Samuel Gridley-Howe and other reformers wanted to establish training schools where people with intellectual disabilities could learn and be prepared for society.\n\nThe history of state schools and psychiatric hospitals are linked throughout history. State schools started being built in the United States in the 1850s. People often used the term \"feeble-minded\" which could apply to both intellectual and developmental disabilities and mental illness, or in some cases, perceived sexual promiscuity.\n\nEstablishment \nIn 1848 Howe founded the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth, a private boarding school for people with intellectual disabilities. In that same year, Hervey Wilbur founded a private school in his home in New York. Both schools taught according to the teachings Edouard Seguin. These early training schools sought to educate students and provide schooling, assistance with self-care tasks and physical training.\n\nThe first state-funded school was the New York Asylum for Idiots. It was established in Albany in 1851. This state school aimed to educate children with intellectual disabilities and was reportedly successful in doing so. The school's Board of Trustees declared, in 1853, that the experiment had \"entirely and fully succeeded.\" That success led the New York state legislature to found another building, which opened in Syracuse in 1855. The superintendent of this school for the next 32 years was Hervey Wilbur. In 1852, a school for \"feeble-minded\" youth opened in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and another in Columbus, Ohio in 1857.\n\nWhile the number of schools continued to increase, the amount of training did not. These \"schools\" soon became custodial institutions, places to house people to keep them out of society. Rather than preparing students to join the community, these schools only trained people to do work in an institution setting. The residents that were able were put to work in the institution. Institutions began to argue for funding, saying that they are housing people that would otherwise be in almshouses or poorhouses. These larger custodial institutions were established in many states in the following decades.\n\nSchools, colonies and farms \nTraining schools sought to train people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, even if that aim was almost never followed through. Other models of institutions also arose, but all of them were often called state schools.\n\nSuperintendents of institutions believed that people with different disabilities should be separated. Often, institutions would establish separate buildings, such as an \"epileptic colony\" and places for \"high-grades,\" which was the term used to refer to people with disabilities who were forced to work in institutions. One specific way people were forced to work were farm colonies. People would purchase cheap rural farm land and force the residents to work on the farm growing food and harvesting dairy products. The food produced was either used for the institutions or sold. Many institutions sought to develop self-sufficiency. This was another way to keep people with disabilities separated from society.\n\nEugenics \nThese large custodial institutions continued to be built into the 20th century. At the same time, eugenics began to gain proponents throughout the United States, as well as Europe. Eugenics centered around the aim to increase the \"genetic quality\" of the human race. Eugenicists decided that some traits were \"undesirable.\" One of the primary undesirable traits was \"feeble-mindedness.\" Scientists and doctors became much less concern with teaching or training people with disabilities and focused more on separating them from society, stopping them from reproducing, and in some cases, advocating for their murder.\n\nMany eugenicists thought that white Western Europeans were superior to other races and peoples. They developed extremely flawed measures to \"prove\" this superiority. The Stanford-Binet IQ test was developed to identify people who were feeble-minded. In 1913 the United States Public Health Service administered the newly invented Binet IQ test to immigrants arriving at Ellis Island. Professional researchers recorded that \"79% of the Italians, 80% of the Hungarians, 83% of the Jews, and 87% of the Russians are feeble-minded.\" These findings, as well as others, were used to justify racism and anti-immigrant xenophobia in the United States and Europe.\n\nIn addition, new compulsory public school laws required children to attend school. Teachers had more chances to notice people who struggled and recommend them for an institutions. Eugenics proponents also taught classes to teachers on identifying the \"feeble-minded.\"\n\nThroughout this era, the most popular belief was that intellectual and developmental disabilities, as well as mental illness, were entirely genetic and resulted in poverty, drunkenness, sexual promiscuity, crime, violence, and other social ills. People with disabilities were considered \"menaces.\" Dr. Henry Goddard, a psychologist at Vineland Training School in New Jersey, wrote a book claiming that they investigated the family history of a woman at the institution and demonstrated that \"feeble-mindedness\" was genetic and caused all of social ills. Goddard said,Painting so many people as a threat led to increasing numbers of people sent to institutions. Institutions became even more overcrowded. Superintendents, concerned about overcrowding and of the \"threat\" of people with disabilities having children's, started to sterilize the inmates. Many of those sterilized against their will were living in state schools or state hospitals. Over thirty states had compulsory sterilization laws and over 60,000 people with disabilities were sterilized.\n\nBuck v. Bell, the infamous Supreme Court case that legalized involuntarily sterilization, was about Carrie Buck, a woman diagnosed as \"feeble-minded\" after she was raped by her foster brother and put into an institution. A family tree (that was later shown to be falsified) said that she was the third generation diagnosed with feeble-mindedness. US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. famously declared \"three generations of imbeciles are enough!\"\n\nAmerican eugenicists would go onto serve as a model for Nazi Germany to replicate as they sought to institutionalize, sterilize, and murder the \"undesirables\" in their own country.\n\nLists of state schools\n\nAlabama \nBryce State Hospital *Served inmates with I/DD until Partlow opened\nSearcy Hospital *Served inmates with I/DD until Partlow opened\nPartlow State School and Hospital, Tuscaloosa (1919–2011)\nLurleen Wallace Developmental Center, Decatur (1971–2003)\nJ.S.

were no services available in the territory of alaska for individuals who experienced mental illness or developmental disabilities at the time mental illness was considered a crime alaskan adults and children were arrested convicted of being insane and sent by the federal government to live at morningside hospital in portland oregon they were taken from their families and communities by dog sled train and boat in the end at least 3500 alaskans were sent to morningside between 1904 and the 1960s when morningside was finally closed many were never heard from by their families again these are

from the east portland historical overview and historic preservation study published by the city of portland bureau of planning and sustainability march 2009 for nearly sixty years morningside hospital sat on a 47acre parcel in hazlewood at the junction of se stark street and 96th avenue formerly agricultural land the site was developed as a psychiatric hospital complex and working farm in 1910 after wwii many of the farmers in the surrounding area retired and their land was developed into suburban communities the rising population increased consumer demand and the underconstruction interstate freeway promised easy access in 1970 the site was redeveloped as mall 205 the hospital founded in 1899 by dr henry waldo coe was originally run out of his familys home in 1905 coe purchased the massachusetts building from the lewis and clark exposition and moved it from the exposition site in nw portland to mt tabor where it was converted into a psychiatric hospital five years later dr coe movedoperations to what would be its final location a 47 acre site in east portland bounded by se 96th and 102nd avenues and stark and main streets during its early years the hospital went by several names including dr coes nervous sanitarium mindease mt tabor sanitarium and crystal springs sanitarium in 1904 morningside was awarded a contract from the us department of the interior to care for mentally ill and mentally handicapped patients from the territory of alaska who would constitute the bulk of the hospitals patients throughout its tenure between 1905 and 1968 nearly 5000 patients were admitted to morningside not including the roughly 40 admitted monthly on behalf of multnomah county which used the hospital for emergency care after dr henry waldo coes death in 1927 morningside was taken over by his son wayne coe although not a medical doctor wayne coe acted as hospital administrator and eventually as chairman of the henry waldo coe foundation in 1955 morningside came under attack after a bill was introduced by us rep edith green d of oregon to transfer care of alaskan patients to alaska questions of financial impropriety raised during hearings lead to an investigation of the hospital by the us general accounting office in 1956 by this time wayne coes son henry coe had entered the family business the coes were accused of using hospital funds for personal expenses including trips to south africa and mexico a beach property in gearhart and a ranch in stanfield oregon the coes were also accused of outrageous abuse of privilege including the use of patient labor for home and hospital building and maintenance under the guise of occupational therapy the coes denied the charges defended the hospital practices and called the investigation rude uncivil and insulting ultimately no criminal charges were filed and morningside was fully reaccredited in 1957 by 1964 morningsides reputation had recovered to the degree that it was featured in an oregonian article about its success as an open hospital under the open hospital model patients were controlled through sedatives rather than lock and key the alaskan mental health enabling act was passed in 1956 and alaskan patients began being moved from morningside to new facilities in their home state the coes attempted to reorient the hospital in 1960 they announced that the transfer of 210 patients from morningside will enable the portland psychiatric hospital to begin taking patients locally the oregonian reported hospital officials feel that morningsides present facilities and rehabilitation programs geared to both mentally ill and mentally retarded can be adapted to private patients with a few changes morningside was never able to recover from the loss of alaskan patients however and attempts by henry coe to find a buyer who would continue to use the facilities for medical purposes were unsuccessful in the summer of 1968 the last three patients were discharged and morningside prepared to close its doors the site was sold to lenrich associates a new york based property developer which in partnership with interstate department stores redeveloped the land as mall 205 sources

march 1 1860 governor magoffin signed a bill to create an institution for the education and training of the feebleminded children of kentucky thus was established the second institution of this kind west of the alleghenies one in ohio founded 3 years earlier on july 3 1860 a 61 acre plot of ground was purchased from the estate of dr lloyd for 6500 there were buildings on the grounds which could accommodate 1214 children a new building was planned to house 75 children  all officers  attendants it was to be 54 by 123 feet and 4 stories high at an estimated cost of 25000 construction began on october 28 1860 and was completed the following year the first child was admitted august 16 1860 it is not stated that this was the first child admitted but only appears in minutes of a board meeting it is ordered that lizzie bradford of augusta bracken co ky be admitted a pupil terms to be fixed hereafter fifteen children ranging in age from 8 to 17 were received from nine counties the admission of the oldest children was a violation of the decision by the board that july that stated ages of the pupils should be admitted at six years for the youngest and fourteen for the oldest there were more than 50 applications children were divided into classes according to intellect they had to be at least 6 years old and not older than 14 years old although children from the age of 17 were admitted several skirmishes during the civil war caused some damage to the facility at a cost of around 15000 in 1864 the establishment of a mechanical department was developed the pupils made mattresses brooms and brushes during this period the following words were used idiots imbecile and feebleminded it was suggested in 1866 that the purpose of the institution be changed so that the lowest grade of untrainable children could be admitted more careful definition is indicated they are more correctly designated as feebleminded or imbeciles idiots are usually regarded as persons destitute of intellect at the beginning of dr blacks superintendency there were 55 children in the institution in 1871 88 starting in 1875 a regular quarterly statement of the number of children enrolled was entered into the minutes at the time there were 100 children 6 of whom were paid for by parents a construction program started in 1869 made possible the increase in the population a change in the law made it necessary that the superintendent be a physician dr edward h black was elected with a fixed salary of 1500 a year some increase in the salaries of teachers was allowed in the 1870s corporal punishment was used the institution was referred to as the third kentucky lunatic asylum a special committee made an investigation into reports of immorality upon the part of dr eh black the first being dismissed as a vague rumor but the second investigated by a special committee a girl became pregnant while an inmate of the institution advised by the board of commissioners the superintendent arranged for care of the girl outside of the institution a sum of 50 was set aside for her care until permanent arraignments could be made the girl urged by her relatives said that dr black was not the father of the child though she could not tell what she meant by saying so the legislative committee concluded he was not guilty as charged but was culpable the board of commissioners discussed in 1877 the educational theory for the mental defective as they believed it should be comprehended idiots  imbeciles should be treated distinctly from other classes they ought not to be associated with lunatics in asylums or paupers in poorhouses their education should be based on physical conditions it was decided that it should commence at the earliest age at which the child could be separated from the mothers care they also stated idiots  imbeciles should have thorough industrial training to enable them to contribute their own support also it was encouraged to cultivate any literary scientific artistic or mechanical faculty that they may possess to promote their selfrespect and to make them feel as they are of some use to society common industries were introduced carpenter shop shoe shop and sewing shop in the 1880s new buildings were built and improvements were made to the property practically all the digging was done by the boys at the institution the total capacity was now 250 segregation was recommended by 1885 the may 1885 minutes of the board meeting said to relieve the state of the tax for idiots a custodial building should be erected for them on the grounds of this institution when dr owens was superintendent five years later the subject was brought up again under dr kehoe both sterilization  segregation were considered with emphasis on sterilization in some cases approximately 10 years later dr taylor referred to sterilization as a subject for serious study the strongest recommendation for it passed when dr lyon was superintendent a law passed the house in 1928 but was defeated in the senate on the morning of may 3 1889 at 930am a fire began in an unoccupied room on the fourth floor most of the children were out of the building at the time no lives were lost emergency arraignments were made as many offers of help came in the girls were cared for at the farm of mr dudley  the boys were housed in a large stable on the hospital grounds plans were made for the construction of some temporary buildings by 1890 new buildings were completed a great deal of work was completed by the boys a value of about 10000 the estimated total was 70000 and could house 250 children at the time dr berry was appointed in 1894 106 children were enrolled changes were immediately made about 20 were purely custodial cases and as the law directed were dismissed and returned to the counties from which they came some new children were received so that the population was 94 by the time the report was made in the 1900s more improvements were made

professor with the wyoming institute for disabilities and sandy leotti an assistant professor with the division of social work are the awardees the wlrc formerly named the wyoming state training school opened in 1912 to provide residential care and education to people who would now be diagnosed with intellectual and developmental disabilities historically state schools such as the wlrc became custodial in nature where people were confined often for decades or lifetimes within the institution over the years the wlrc has changed dramatically in response to disability rights and advocacy efforts resulting in deinstitutionalization longterm residents were reintegrated into communities across wyoming decades ago today the wlrc is undergoing another transformation by providing temporary residential health services to individuals with complex and significant needs the new mission of the facility is to fill a gap in services for people who are not able to access appropriate supports in their communities our research project seeks to investigate the long history of the wyoming life resource center from the early decades as a state training school through deinstitutionalization to its current incarnation as a health care facility for people with significant disabilities and complex support needs bush says through documenting the history of the institution as well as its current

the goal is to develop a partnership not only with the wlrc but also with former residents families community members and other stakeholders to document a multilayered history of the institution and its connections to residents staff members families communities and the state of wyoming the first prong being more archival in nature seeks to understand the institution and its operations specifically prior to the 1970s the second prong focusing more on the years leading up to and following deinstitutionalization will involve identifying people involved in the former state school who are interested in recounting oral histories using a communitybased participatory approach to inform our historical research we also will rely upon community participants to identify local and statewide health disability and social integration issues relevant to this project bush says through this process the hope is to identify health and other disparities that have been produced through the process of deinstitutionalization and community reintegration in rural communities these disparities can then be targeted in future research furthermore the development of this partnership will lead to future collaborations which can specifically examine the experience and impact of rural community reintegration including gaps in support or services and the relationship of these on the health and wellbeing of wlrcs residents we are in the initial stages of this project having just completed our first trip to lander bush says we had meetings about partnership directions and processes
