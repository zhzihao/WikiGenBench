The event took place on  at the American Legion Post #308 in Reseda, California.\n\nThe tournament would be held to determine the #1 contenders for the PWG World Tag Team Championship. Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent?) won the tournament by defeating The Inner City Machine Guns (Rich Swann and Ricochet) in the final. Aside from the tournament, Tommaso Ciampa defeated Adam Thornstowe, and Drake Younger defeated Chris Hero, Johnny Gargano and Kyle O'Reilly in a four-way match to become the #1 contender for the PWG World Championship.\n\nProduction\n\nBackground\nOn December 23, 2013, PWG announced on its official Twitter account that the 2014 edition of DDT4 would take place at the American Legion Post #308 in Reseda, California.\n\nStorylines\nIt was announced that unlike the previous edition, the PWG World Tag Team Championship would not be defended in the 2014 edition. Instead, the winning team would become the #1 contenders for the World Tag Team Championship. The participants announced for the DDT4 were:\nAfrican-American Wolves (A. C. H. and A. R. Fox)\nBest Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent?)\nCole Steen Cole (Adam Cole and Kevin Steen)\nThe Inner City Machine Guns (Rich Swann and Ricochet)\nPPRay (Peter Avalon and Ray Rosas)\nRockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma)\nUnbreakable F'n Machines (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin)\nWorld's Cutest Tag Team (Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan)\n\nTwo non-tournament matches were also announced for DDT4. The first match set for the event was a four-way match between Chris Hero, Drake Younger, Johnny Gargano, and Kyle O'Reilly to determine the #1 contender for the PWG World Championship. The second match was a singles match between Roderick Strong and Tommaso Ciampa. However, Strong was unable to compete at DDT4 due to injury, and would be replaced by the debuting Adam Thornstowe as Ciampa's opponent.\n\nEvent\n\nQuarterfinals\nThe DDT4 kicked off with a match between Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent?) and The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma). Best Friends delivered a double chokeslam to Goodtime, with the aid of a trenchcoat, from the top rope for the win.\n\nNext, Unbreakable F'N Machines (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin) took on PPRay (Peter Avalon and Ray Rosas). Cage knocked Rosas out of the ring after Rosas tried to deliver a superplex to Cage and then Cage and Elgin double teamed Avalon as Cage delivered a gorilla press slam into a backfist to Avalon. Elgin then delivered a neckbreaker to Avalon and followed it with an Elgin Bomb for the win.\n\nNext, World's Cutest Tag Team (Candice LeRae and Joey Ryan) took on Cole Steen Cole (Adam Cole and Kevin Steen). Cole knocked LeRae out with a Panama Sunrise and Ryan proceeded to deliver That 70's Kick to Cole. Steen then delivered a pop-up powerbomb to Ryan, and Cole Steen Cole delivered a superkick/package piledriver combination to Ryan and then Cole delivered a superkick to Ryan for the win.\n\nIt was followed by the last match in the quarterfinals between The Inner City Machine Guns (Rich Swann and Ricochet) and African-American Wolves (A. C. H. and A. R. Fox). Swann delivered a handspring cutter to ACH and attempted to deliver a standing 450° splash but ACH avoided it. However, Ricochet managed to deliver a springboard 450° splash to ACH for the win.\n\nAfter the match, Adam Thornstowe made his PWG debut against Tommaso Ciampa. Ciampa delivered a high knee to Thornstowe for the win.\n\nSemifinals\nThe semifinal round of the DDT4 began with a match between Cole Steen Cole and Best Friends. Adam Cole knocked out Chuck Taylor by backdropping him on the chairs set up outside the ring. Kevin Steen then delivered a sleeper suplex to Trent? in the ring, and then Cole Steen Cole attempted to deliver a superkick and a package piledriver combination to Trent?. But Candice LeRae distracted Cole by spitting in his face, causing Cole to chase her in retaliation. Steen was distracted, and Trent? capitalized by pinning him with a jackknife for the win.\n\nNext, Inner City Machine Guns took on Unbreakable F'N Machines. Cage countered a standing 450° splash by Swann into a gorilla press slam into a backfist. A miscommunication then occurred and Cage accidentally delivered a DDT to Elgin, allowing Swann to deliver a standing 450° splash to Elgin and Ricochet followed it with a 630° senton on Elgin. However, Cage caught Ricochet and attempted to deliver a Weapon X but Swann kicked Cage, allowing Ricochet to pin Cage with a sunset flip for the win.\n\nLater, the penultimate match took place. It was a four-way match between Chris Hero, Drake Younger, Johnny Gargano, and Kyle O'Reilly to determine the #1 contender for the PWG World Championship. Gargano and Hero were knocked out, which led to Younger and O'Reilly exchanging moves with each other. It culminated with Younger delivering a Drake's Landing to O'Reilly for the win.\n\nFinal\nIn the DDT4 final, Best Friends took on Inner City Machine Guns. Chuck Taylor countered a handspring cutter attempt by Rich Swann into an Omega Driver for the win.\n\nReception\nDDT4 received mostly positive reviews from critics.\n\nWill Pruett of Pro Wrestling Dot Net praised the event as \"an excellent night of wrestling\", \"with the unexpected crowning of Best Friends as DDT4 winners.\" He further wrote \"The tag team action was all sorts of fun. The setup for Younger vs. Cole and Young Bucks vs. Best Friends (both of which I assume will happen in March) was great. The long term story of LaRae and Cole was also delightful.\"\n\nJake St-Pierre of 411Mania rated the event with 8.0 score, with \"great matches up and down the card\". He considered it a \"consistently fantastic offering\" by PWG, praising all of the matches, with the exception of PPRay's match against Unbreakable F'n Machines, stating it \"more inoffensive than anything.\"\n\nAftermath\nDDT4 would turn out to be Drake Younger's last appearance in PWG, as he signed with WWE in March and was unable to challenge Adam Cole for the PWG World Championship at Mystery Vortex II. Candice LeRae then substituted for Younger and answered Cole's open challenge for the title as a continuation of their feud following their confrontations at DDT4. Cole went on to retain the title.\n\nBest Friends received a World Tag Team Championship opportunity against The Young Bucks as a result of winning DDT4, at Mystery Vortex II, but failed to win the titles.\n\nResults\n\nTournament brackets\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPro Wrestling Guerrilla official website\n\nDynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament\n2014 in professional wrestling\nJanuary 2014 sports events in the United States\n2014 in California\nProfessional wrestling in California\nProfessional wrestling in Los Angeles\n2014 in Los Angeles", "unikey": "Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament (2014)", "summary": "Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament (2014) was the eighth Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament (DDT4) produced by Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).
