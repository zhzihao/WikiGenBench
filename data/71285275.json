{"id": 71285275, "key": "Illuminated River", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated%20River", "text": "Illuminated River is a large-scale public art commission which lights up nine bridges in central London across the River Thames. Designed by American artist Leo Villareal in collaboration with British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, it uses LED light fittings to produce sequenced patterns of moving light across the bridge structures.\n\nAt 3.2 miles (5.1 km) in length, it is one of the world’s longest ever public art commissions. The first phase – Southwark Bridge, Millennium Bridge, London Bridge and Cannon Street Bridge – was launched on 17 July 2019. It was completed in April 2021 with the illumination of Blackfriars Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, Golden Jubilee Footbridges, Westminster Bridge and Lambeth Bridge. The installation has a minimum lifespan of 10 years.\n\nOrigins\nIn 2016, an international competition was launched to design a public light artwork in Central London across bridges on the River Thames. A design by American artist Leo Villareal, in collaboration with British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands was selected from 105 entries by a jury in November 2016. Sarah Gaventa was appointed as Director of the Illuminated River Foundation to lead on the delivery of the project.\n\nInstallation\n\nLed by the Illuminated River Foundation, the project involved the collaboration of statutory bodies, local authorities and communities. The Illuminated River project team submitted 30 planning applications and 18 applications for listed building consent. Illuminated River is the UK’s biggest single planning application made without an act of parliament. The project was developed in consultation and collaboration with the bridge owners: Bridge House Estates, Network Rail, Westminster City Council and Transport for London; and numerous stakeholder organizations, including the Port of London Authority, Historic England, London Wildlife Trust, Zoological Society of London and Cross River Partnership.\n\nBefore installation, a luminance survey of the Thames was carried out from Albert to Tower Bridge using a calibrated camera and specialist software to document the brightness distribution of the bridges and their surroundings. The survey allowed the project team to target a luminance level for the artwork on each bridge, minimise light spill and save energy. This was partly achieved by replacing outdated lighting and introducing new light fittings with two custom elements: ‘One is a blade that can be angled to shield light from falling onto the water, and the other improves pedestrian comfort along the banks by reducing glare’.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessments – documenting the impact of light at night on Thames wildlife – were produced to support the project’s planning applications. A river bird breeding assessment was carried out by the London Wildlife Trust and a river bat activity survey was conducted by Thomson Environmental Consultants. The data collected was used to reduce the impact of the artwork on natural habitats and increase its sensitivity to the environment.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, the installation of bridge lighting over the river Thames required specialist construction workers, “abseilers with electrical engineering degrees”.\n\nFollowing the completion of the first phase, the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, commented: \n\"I am delighted that Illuminated River is bringing more free and accessible artwork to Londoners. The Thames has played a key role in the growth and development of our capital for centuries, and this unique artwork will help Londoners and visitors see it in a whole new way. The Illuminated River will celebrate the unique architecture and heritage of our bridges, showcase creativity, boost life at night and transform the way we think about the Thames.\"\n \n\nThe installation of the second phase started in July 2020. In an interview with Illuminated River contractor’s FM Conway, published in New Civil Engineer, it is stated that “...the second phase included the installation of around 4,000 light fittings, 15km of power and fibre optic cabling and cable trays, as well as approximately 250,000 fixings.” The proximity to existing railway infrastructure required negotiation with Network Rail.\n\nThe Chair of the Illuminated River Foundation, Neil Mendoza, said: “The project was completed on time despite the difficulties of COVID-19 and funded, almost in its entirety, by philanthropists.”\n\nThe project won a Royal Town Planning Institute Award for Planning Excellence in 2021.\n\nDesign\n\nDesigned by Leo Villareal with British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and lighting designers Atelier Ten, Illuminated River employs LEDs and custom fittings to produce sequenced patterns of light across the Thames bridge structures. The patterns of movement continually change and avoid repetition.\n\nThe installation’s colour scheme is influenced by impressionist paintings of the Thames: “The colours and tones used in the paintings of those inveterate Thames-watchers Monet, Whistler and Turner provide some of the inspiration, while at Westminster [Bridge] a shade of green was chosen to complement the colour of the leather upholstery in the House of Commons”.\n\nLeo Villareal described how he intended the artwork to respond to the historical and current context of the site:\n\nThe palette I chose for Lambeth and Westminster bridges reflect the colours of the seats in their respective parliamentary chambers. For Waterloo, I have enhanced either side with the stretch of light and introduced pastel washes of colour to illuminate its central spine. Blackfriars Road Bridge is now awash with warm, rosy hues that cite the remaining columns of the now removed old railway bridge. The Golden Jubilee Footbridges have now featured a kinetic, monochromatic lighting scheme that mirrors the artwork on Millennium Bridge, the only other footbridge in the body of work.\n\nBefore his commission for Illuminated River in 2016, Villareal completed The Bay Lights in 2013, a site-specific monumental light installation on the western span of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.\n\nFunding\n\nThe project was funded by the Rothschild Foundation, Blavatnik Family Foundation, Reuben Foundation and Arcadia Fund, and received seed funding from the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for £250,000.\n\nMedia appearances\n\nOn 31 December 2020, Illuminated River formed part of the Mayor of London’s New Year’s Eve lighting and fireworks display, which incorporated Thames landmarks such as The Shard, Tower Bridge and The O2. The bridges were illuminated with the Union Jack and NHS blue, to pay tribute to the frontline staff and key workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. The ten-minute-long show was broadcast live on BBC One.\n\nA three-part Channel 4 documentary, London’s Great Bridges: Lighting the Thames which aired in July 2019, covered the project up to the launch of the first phase.\n\nCommunity projects\n\nCentre for London’s ‘Lighting London’ research project “exploring how London could make better use of lighting to create a more attractive and sustainable cityscape after dark”, published in March 2021, highlighted the transformative effect of Illuminated River on some of the city’s greatest assets and how new lighting can be “sensitively integrated into an already heavily lit urban context”.\n\nAudio-descriptions of the Illuminated River bridges for visually impaired people were developed in collaboration with sight-loss charity VocalEyes.\n\nMarshalls Landscape Protection donated three benches to the Illuminated River project in 2019. These were installed on the South Bank to allow more people to sit and view the artwork.\n\nA community fund was launched in 2019 to help local groups engage in the project with activities that: ‘encourage more people to enjoy the Thames, its bridges and riverside surroundings at night’.\n\nFree Illuminated River walking tours were offered to staff from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIlluminated River boat tours run by Uber Boat by Thames Clippers and led by the City of London Guides provided cheap access to the Thames.\n\nAwards\n\nThe project has received awards from organizations including: Civic Trust Awards; British Construction Industry Awards; New London Architecture; The Maritime Foundation; The Waterfront Center; The Planning Awards; LONDON Design Awards and the Royal Town Planning Institute.\n\nReferences\n\n2019 establishments in England\nBridge light displays\nInstallation art works\nRiver Thames", "unikey": "Illuminated River", "summary": "Illuminated River is a large-scale public art commission which lights up nine bridges in central London across the River Thames.[1][2][3] Designed by American artist Leo Villareal in collaboration with British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, it uses LED light fittings to produce sequenced patterns of moving light across the bridge structures.[4]\n", "outlines": ["Origins", "Installation", "Design", "Funding", "Media_appearances", "Community_projects", "Awards", "References"], "contents": ["In 2016, an international competition was launched to design a public light artwork in Central London acrossbridges on the River Thames.A design by American artist Leo Villareal, in collaboration with British architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands was selected from 105 entries by a jury in November 2016.

lighting up london  shortlisted entries in competition to illuminate the river thames prev next story highlights cnn  the river thames is probably londons most iconic symbol but after dark its an invisible artery silently snaking through the heart of the city thats set to change thanks to an ambitious competition designed to bring the famous river to life with a series of beautiful light installations launched in 2016 the illuminated river design competition called for a pioneering light scheme for central londons bridges along the river thames and received more than 105 entries from 20 countries this month the design of american light artist leo villareal and british architects lifschutz davidson sandilands was crowned the winner beating five shortlisted competitors when implemented their design will be the largest public art exhibition in the citys history let there be light this isnt villareals first river rodeo trained as a sculptor the american visual artist showcased his ability to paint with light in a similar 2013 public project the bay lights which illuminated the san francisco bay bridge james ewing the london project will be even more ambitious covering six nautical miles and potentially spanning 17 bridges starting from the western albert bridge and finishing at tower bridge the teams current design is driven by a computer algorithm discreet sensors monitor the motion of the river  such as high tide and low tide  and send that data back to villareals computer program which uses it to create kinetic light art villareal paints with light and his paintbox is a computer software program sarah gaventa director of the illuminated river foundation tells cnn the idea that its programmed means we can update it tweak it and adjust it whenever we need the light display will change depending on the tide for instance in low tide the underbellies of the bridges may glow softly villareal will sit by the river and test out different approaches and effects to make sure its right as he tests the effects the public will see it its not a question of putting lamps on a bridge and pushing one button the dynamic light exhibition will change from bridge to bridge in order to showcase the unique architecture of each structure each bridge has to be controlled separately to enhance the architectural qualities and remain sensitive to that says gaventa the runners up entrants were asked to think of londons bridges  many of which such as the 130yearold tower bridge are historic  as canvases on which they could paint with light the six finalists included adjaye associates proposed blurring boundaries featuring bold patterns from international artists where lighting would be attached to the bridges themselves while architecture and design studio al_as the eternal story saw the bottoms of the bridges glow with a warm amber light during low tide tim jamestim james relying on private donations the illuminated river foundation has currently raised 10 million 124805 of the estimated 20 million needed to fund the project work will commence next year with an aim to see the first phase completed by the end of 2018 but gaventa says the whole project could take years to implement due to several logistical hurdles each bridge is owned and operated by a different entity and the team will need to consider public opinion and their works impact on local fish birds and bats  all of which could be affected by the lights which the competition promises will be very discreet over the next 5 years or longer londons thames will

along the thames its subtly moving sequences of led light symbolically unify londons thames bridges drawing inspiration from the spirit and history of the river and from the architectural and engineering heritage of its bridges london cannon street southwark and millennium bridges were illuminated in july 2019 blackfriars waterloo golden jubilee westminster and lambeth bridges will

londoners and visitors alike to engage with culture in the open air and to enjoy the public spaces of the riverside at night led by the illuminated river foundation the project involves a unique and long lasting collaboration of statutory bodies local authorities and communities leaving a legacy for the capital in the form of a dynamic artwork with a minimum lifespan of ten years the team submitted 30 planning applications and 18 applications for listed building consent engaging with over 50 stakeholders on and near the river holding scores of onetoone meetings with heritage and ecology groups local resident organisations and civic societies designed and programmed by internationally renowned new yorkbased artist leo villareal working with british project architects lifschutz davidson sandilands and lighting designers atelier ten the artwork respects the natural environment and local inhabitants creating a sensitive and sitespecific interplay with the river by removing current inefficient lighting on the bridges and replacing it with smart led technologies and custom fittings the new scheme reduces light spill onto the river and provides a better environment for thames flora and fauna prior to illumination atelier ten carried out an extensive and innovative luminance survey from albert to tower bridge 45 miles using a calibrated camera and specialist analysis software a calibrated luminance record of both banks of the river was produced documenting the brightness distribution of the bridges and their surroundings the survey enabled the team to target a luminance level for each bridge sufficiently bright that the bridge will be seen against its background whilst not overpowering neighbours or views of landmarks this control of luminance has facilitated significant energy savings 75 saving in the case of london bridge compared to previous lighting moreover two custom elements were designed for the light fittings one is a blade that can be angled to shield light from falling onto the water and the other improves pedestrian comfort along the banks by reducing glare four families of luminaire types are attached to the bridges across the whole scheme this simple palette of fittings allows standardisation of details and fixing arrangements as well as rationalising controls maintenance and replacement all this kit is attached seamlessly to the bridge structures in a way that enhances their architectural beauty in daylight as well as providing the canvas for the artwork at night view video back to entries supplier partners lighting

will eventually see up to fifteen bridges along the river thames bathed in new light installations  is the result of an unparalleled collaboration between londonbased and international creative talent local authorities and partners free to view and accessible to all illuminated river hopes to act as a symbol for londons creativity ambition and spirit the artwork aims to celebrate the architecture and heritage of londons historic bridges and will encourage more people to enjoy the river and the riverside at night artwork for the first four bridges  london cannon street southwark and millennium  is expected to be seen more than 60 million times each year by londoners and visitors alike conceived by internationallyacclaimed artist leo villareal alongside architectural practice lifschutz davidson sandilands illuminated river is a philanthropicallyfunded initiative supported by the mayor of london and delivered by the illuminated river foundation working with seven different local authorities illuminated river is the biggest single planning application ever made without an act of parliament and is the first time that the bridges along the thames will have been cohesively and artistically lit the foundation led by director sarah gaventa developed the project in consultation and collaboration with more than 50 organisations on and around the thames including the port of london authority historic england transport for london network rail london wildlife trust the zoological society of london and cross river partnership alongside the seven local authorities who have granted 30 planning permissions and eighteen listed building consents the first four bridges of the scheme are now lit up in unison with sequenced led patterns subtly unfolding across each unique structure villareals artwork replaces outdated and inefficient lighting on the bridges providing a more longterm sustainable solution for lighting the thames designed by atelier ten the lighting will minimise direct light spill onto the river and reduce energy consumption while the former lighting ran all night from dusk until dawn illuminated rivers connected led lighting from official lighting supplier signify will be switched off at 2am villareals artwork continues in the footsteps of generations of artists who have been inspired by the thames using signifys connected led lighting to paint with light drawing on colours influenced by the palettes of impressionist and english romantic painters with shifting hues that mimic the london sky during sunset moonlight and sunrise and gently kinetic patterns that are inspired by the natural and social activity of the river villareals artwork celebrates the thames as londons living artery the artwork has also been sensitively developed paying attention to heritage wildlife and the location of each bridge respecting and revealing their individual histories and architectural features the dynamic public artwork refocuses attention on the thames bridges as social historical and architectural landmarks and celebrates their role in londons global identity signifys color kinetics led luminaires have been used to illuminate the bridges colour kinetics graze luminaires have been employed to light up the sides of the bridges while the underneath features colour kinetics reach elite fixtures elsewhere colour kinetics blast luminaires have been used to light the bridge piers these are all controlled using signifys interact landmark system which will centrally manage the new connected lighting for all fifteen bridges once completed the project is expected to feature more than 22000 led light points all monitored remotely by the signify control system site works for the first phase of the project began in january 2019 two years after the winning team was announced by mayor of london sadiq khan and closely following the granting of planning permission the foundation is on track to complete phase two by autumn 2020 which will include blackfriars road waterloo golden jubilee footbridges westminster and lambeth bridges once completed illuminated river will span from albert bridge in the west to tower bridge in the east at 25 miles in length along 45 nautical miles of the thames it will be the longest public art commission in the world and is anticipated to be viewed over a billion times during its tenyear lifespan coinciding with the launch of the first phase the illuminated river foundation also announced an extensive unescoendorsed public programme from boat and walking tours to exhibitions and new music commissions the initiatives have been devised to celebrate the bridges and help reconnect people with the river at the centre of the engagement programme is a collaboration with guildhall school of music  drama composers from both the composition and electronic music department of guildhall school have been commissioned to create original scores inspired by the heritage architectural context and villareals artwork the compositions have captured the character of each bridge with some arranged for orchestra and others using spoken work poetry found sound and electronica to tell the story of the structures listening to the pieces audiences will be transported to past eras to the time of medieval candle makers of candelwrichstrete cannon street or to the hustle and bustle of londons frenetic victorian streets all the pieces act as an homage to the ebb and flow of the river and the bridges that have enabled the city to thrive with each piece responding to one of the bridges the illuminated river foundation has worked with various partners across london including vocaleyes who produce audio descriptions for blind and partially sighted people to make the compositions accessible and available to the general public hannah rothschild originated the idea of lighting the bridges and is a trustee of the illuminated river foundation a supporter of the project throughout on the launch of the first phase she said the river thames is londons liquid history and its beating heart and the bridges are the arteries connecting north south east and west but at night these extraordinary structures each with a unique history and style evanesce into darkness and obscurity this project one of the worlds longest and most ambitious cultural commissions will transform a snake of darkness into a ribbon of light threading art through the heart of the city sadiq khan added from the fourth plinth to art on the underground our city has a rich heritage of showcasing public art and i am delighted that illuminated river is bringing more free and accessible artwork to londoners the thames has played a key role in the growth and development of our capital for centuries and this unique artwork will help londoners and visitors see it in a whole new way the illuminated river will celebrate the unique architecture and heritage of our bridges showcase creativity boost life at night and transform the way we think about the thames leo villareal continued with illuminated river the largest artwork ive ever conceived im hoping to follow in the footsteps of monet turner and whistler and reveal the truly unique inspiring and poetic character of the thames studying the river and the history of london for the last three years was a fantastic experience that changed me and allowed me to grow as an artist the integrated nuances and motions across the bridges create a unified piece that celebrates and enhances the river as a continuous living entity im both delighted and humbled by the completion of this initial phase and i cant wait for the public to experience the first four bridges finally alex lifschutz founding principal of lifschutz davidson sandilands exclaimed this arts project will illuminate not just the river but also the history and architecture of our wonderful city by revealing its iconic bridges in a new light the art subtly reveals their beauty and in some cases their muscularity transforming even the humblest railway bridges into iconic forms of particular interest to me is that transformative quality  with literally the lightest touch the art alters

stir villareal walks us through his long association with the sequence of lights digital programming and recently installed work illuminated river in london the uk westminster bridge illuminated river image courtesy of james newton dilpreet bhullar db as an artist what triggered your interest in the light and use it as a medium to explore human sensory awareness leo villareal lv my interest in light came about very organically  i first attended the burning man festival in the mid90s it takes place in the nevada desert and it was still quite a small event back then it was almost pitch black at night and i kept getting profoundly lost trying to find my tent in the dark by the third year i decided to do something about it and created what is probably my first light work 16 strobe lights with a microcontroller that could turn them off and on at the lowest level of code  zero is off one is on i put it on top of my mobile home as a utilitarian device but it turned out to be quite a potent thing and i realised i was on to something with the combination of software light and space and the communal nature of it people could see it from a distance looking back that first artwork feels very primordial  i was harnessing the power of light almost like a digital campfire this is what started my journey of combining my experience of art with my interest in technology blackfriars bridge illuminated river image courtesy of james newton db do you think the onset of digital technology has eased the practice of colour selection and combination especially when you are working on the largescale architectural works lv it has been really helpful to work with programmes like unreal engine which enable me to visualise the colours and patterns in realtime in terms of colour scheme for illuminated river a lot of consideration has gone into the levels of light in a way that is respectful of the wildlife of the river thames but also culturally in line with a rich heritage of artists whom this majestic river has inspired over the centuries i have taken inspiration from the historical and current context of the site  for example the palette i chose for lambeth and westminster bridges reflect the colours of the seats in their respective parliamentary chambers for waterloo i have enhanced either side with the stretch of light and introduced pastel washes of colour to illuminate its central spine blackfriars road bridge is now awash with warm rosy hues that cite the remaining columns of the now removed old railway bridge the golden jubilee footbridges have now featured a kinetic monochromatic lighting scheme that mirrors the artwork on millennium bridge the only other footbridge in the body of work artist leo villareal image courtesy of leo villareal studio db could you tell us more about the different layers of ideation and execution process that define your art piece if you could illustrate your answer by giving an example of the work illuminated river lv it depends on the type of work  for illuminated river the project was launched as a competition in 2016 so i worked closely with british architecture practice lifschutz davidson sandilands to submit an entry that felt respectful to the environment but also transformative and impactful for the first four bridges that were illuminated in 2019 london cannon street southwark and millennium i spent months down by the thames observing the environment and programming the illuminations on site it was great to feel the energy of the thames and the riverbank and allow that to inform my programming i have always admired the impressionist and english romantic painters who worked en plein air and portrayed the river on their canvases all those years ago they served as a key piece of inspiration for me with this project i enjoy the fact that i can take a similar approach all these years later through more of a contemporary technological lens this time because of the pandemic i was unable to visit london and experience the artwork on site until very late in the programming stage instead i was able to use liveu streaming technology ordinarily used for broadcast live sports or news events to programme from my studio in brooklyn the great thing about this software is that it has less than a second delay  it is the closest i could have got to be there in real life 01 min watch illuminated river trailer landscape video courtesy of leo villareal studio db so after watching the colourful display of illuminated river what could be the final takeaway for the viewers lv we really wanted to play with the compulsion of people to recognise patterns  our brains cannot help but synchronise signals that are coming in we tried to engage with the different kinetic activity on the river from the boat traffic to the classic red buses to the pedestrians out for an evening stroll that feeling of connection between the artwork and its visitors was really important to me particularly as this is a sitespecific piece so it needs to react to its environment i am interested in peoples connections such as how they relate the artwork to the movement of the thames and the tide it is deliberate not literal and open to interpretation the beautiful thing about this project is that it is so focused on connections  from the technology of individual bulbs by signify to the bridges themselves given where we are as a society at the moment i hope people experience it as a hopeful unifying piece of work for london illuminated river waterloo to lambeth bridges image

been at the heart of the illuminated river project which is transforming our perceptions of the thames and more importantly the bridges that cross it in central london illuminated river is a longterm free art installation supported by the mayor which transforms the capital at night with an orchestrated series of light works that currently includes nine bridges in spring 2021 the original four bridges were joined by another five in the political and cultural centre of london from london bridge to lambeth bridge the projects subtly moving sequences of led light symbolically unify londons thames bridges drawing inspiration from the spirit of the river and from the architectural and engineering heritage of its bridges the artwork is created by internationally renowned new yorkbased artist leo villareal working with londonbased project architects lifschutz davidson sandilands it draws attention to the bridges across the thames and brings to life aspects of the city after dark programming his artwork on site like a plein air painter villareals light compositions mimic the everchanging movement of the river using shifting hues drawn from the london sky at sunset and by moonlight the artist takes inspiration from the natural and social activity of the thames boats and barges moving people and cargo the traffic surrounding the bridges and the ebb and flow of the tides translating this atmosphere using custom created software villareals patterns are organic and ever evolving never repeating or resolving into a single image once the nine bridges are all complete the artwork will be 32 miles in length making it the longest public art project in the world seen more than 90 million times in a normal year led by the illuminated river foundation the project involves a unique and long lasting collaboration of statutory bodies local authorities and communities the artwork is the result of one of the most detailed and extensive panlondon planning processes the capital has ever seen involving five different bridge owners and spanning seven boroughs and two unesco world heritage sites in the tower of london and the palace of westminster it has been developed in consultation and collaboration with over 50 organisations on and around the river and seven local authorities from whom 30 planning permissions and 18 listed building consents have been granted unlike hs2 or tideway this was achieved without the benefit of an act of parliament we hope the project will enrich the experience of travelling along and across the river at night and encourage londoners and visitors to use the river  currently the citys most underused artery  as a means of transport as commuting tends to decrease dramatically after dark we were very surprised by research that showed how many children in london have never been on or even seen the thames in westminster alone one child in ten has never seen it and lowincome families do not visit it this is partly because though the thames is londons biggest public space by far it cannot be accessed for free to address this we set up the cheapest boat tours possible which are the same price as commuting and offered free ones for local communities which may only be a few streets back from the thames but no longer feel connected to it community engagement has played a vital role in the development of the project we gathered feedback from commuters river and bridge users and visitors and conducted numerous onetoone meetings with a variety of stakeholders including heritage and ecology groups local resident associations and civic societies we also did research on luminance levels creating the first ever luminance survey of the thames to assess current levels of brightness on and around the river and identify where light spill glare and pollution is occurring during the research process we found that albert bridge throws out as much light as a motorway it turns out most of the light spill is from surrounding buildings which are often lit way over the recommended levels and we have been approaching owners who have been shocked by our findings the view we have of london at night particularly around the thames is directed by facilities managers commercial buildings tend to be the most brightly lit rather than a curated approach which respects the historic environment this is something we would like to see change and we have instigated a project with centre for london about how we can all share best practice to create a more holistic and sustainable approach thanks to google arts  culture 360 the artwork can be viewed remotely the first nighttime project to be included offering an immersive experience of the artwork and encouraging millions of virtual visitors to stroll the banks of the river thames and learn about its history and heritage we have also commissioned original musical scores inspired by the first four illuminated river bridges from students at the guildhall school of music and drama and more are planned for the following five bridges these pieces can be downloaded for free along with audio guides including one specially created for people with sight loss the project has spawned dedicated rambling night kayaking mud larking sketching photography and other activities which we hope will increase post covid19 installing the illuminated river project was already challenging and the pandemic added to the frisson the thames is a busy working river a wildlife superhighway that must be respected it has complex health and safety issues and our work had to be programmed around tideways activities we had to take into account the management of river and road traffic not only that but we were also dealing with a rail bridge on which disrupted services could be expensive and chaotic though covid19 has added more challenges to the installation including delays to manufacture of kit capacity issues due to furlough amongst key partners and managing socially distanced sites we were well prepared and remain on schedule to complete on time the pandemic has shown that we need good public spaces even more than ever pleasant places to walk in and around and spaces that support our mental health and wellbeing the outside has become the new inside the streets our new restaurants public realm our new art galleries so we are pleased that illuminated river with its soothing and gently kinetic artwork has provided some comfort to people during these testing times if we can create something that is enjoyed and remains in place for a decade or more something that changes peoples perceptions of the bridges encourages them to notice the changing tide and ow of the thames to pause and look around at what has become so familiar that it is often ignored then we will know that the challenge of creating this project will have been well worth it sarah gaventa is director of the illuminated river foundation an hon fellow of both riba and the
