of reason for optimism around several of these teamsthe panthers saw one of the biggest jumps of any team with an increase of more than 2500 fans per game when compared to 201920 and that was before floridas magical playoff run to the stanley cup final so there is every reason to be hopeful that ticket numbers only increase in south florida for next seasonafter years of being an attendance powerhouse chicago plummeted to the bottom last season routinely playing in front of thousands of empty seats at the united center chicagos drop of more than 4000 fans per game compared to 201920 was the largest drop of any club in the nhl excluding arizona who switched to a smaller venue but if chicago selects connor bedard with the no 1 pick in next weeks draft the generational talent may be able to singlehandedly reinvigorate ticket sales in the marketplace just winning the lottery has made an impact on seasonticket sales the blackhawks told espn they made 52 million in ticketing revenue less than a day after the team won the right to select bedardadvertisementanaheim could see a bump if a no 2 selection such as adam fantilli hits the ground running next season under new coach greg croninand while the buffalo sabres saw their attendance drop by 1600 fans per game there is also some excitement that the club could be on the precipice of competing for a playoff spot attendance numbers in buffalo improved over the course of the season as the team remained in the thick of the playoff race average attendance improved to 15567 up from 13634 in december if the sabres break out of their 12year playoff drought next spring we should expect the keybank center to be filled to capacity on most nights buffalo has historically been one of the strongest hockey markets in the league but fans have grown tired of the perpetual losingthe only team on this list that could be in for another rough season on the attendance front is the san jose sharks even with erik karlsson producing a magical norriscaliber season it wasnt enough to bring the fans out in droves the sharks were the only team to play to less than 80 percent capacity last season and if they start the process of a
