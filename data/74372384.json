bogart never said play it again sam in the 1942 oscarwinning classic casablanca in fact no one says it in the movie and the mysterious voice in the adored 1989 fantasy film field of dreams does not tell kevin costner if you build it they will come released 30 years ago on april 21 1989 field of dreams stars kevin costner and amy madigan as ray and annie kinsella a couple raising corn on a bucolic iowa farm with a young daughter played by gaby hoffman who went on to star in transparent at dusk one evening ray hears a voice saying if you build it he will come but according to the films writerdirector phil alden robinson there is a whole group of people who insist its they however robinson and the studio have been tightlipped over the past three decades about who actually says those lines in the movie in the credits it says himself said robinson i thought that was sort of funny it was okay with the person who did the voice so we just decided to keep it a secret it is a baseball diamond and eventually shoeless joe jackson ray liotta a member of the infamous 1919 black sox baseball team comes out to the cornfield with other members of the team and begins to play baseball there but the real reason for baseball diamond is for ray to connect with the young version of his late father john dwier brown who also comes out of the field the two play catch during the finale a moment tends to turn grown mens hearts into mush based on wr kinsellas book shoeless joe the film also stars timothy busfield as mark annies brother who doesnt see the players and wants them to sell the farm james earl jones as terrence mann a jr salingeresque writer and frank whaleyburt lancaster as moonlight graham nominated for three oscars  best film adapted screenplay and for james horners score field of dreams had a worldwide gross of 84 million the film made costner who gives one of his strongest performances an even a bigger star  and he became heartthrob at the time pilgrimages to dyersville iowa according to roman weinberg the operations manager of go the distance baseball the company that brought the lansing farm where the film was shot in 2012 some 115000 people flock to the movie site every year we do have a good segment of those who are returners said weinberg who has seen the film at least 24 times but a majority surprisingly are newcomers and have wanted to come for years we get thousands of new faces we get people from australia china and japan though the main premise of the movie is baseball he noted the moral of the story is following your dreams no matter what and being able to right a wrong i cant tell you how many grown men i have come across that have cried when coming here and tell me that they weep every time they see the last scene of the film  there are home tours 359 days a year and recently fans can spend the night at the house  that is if you want to spend 900 for a weekend or 750 on a weekday for prime season weinberg said that fans began to show up at the farm within weeks of its release and when people started coming to the farm a group of local extras who appear in the film  two of them even have speaking parts  ordered 1919 black sox jerseys and came out of the corn and started interacting with the fans and the ghost players still come out on sundays and performer a 90minute harlem globetrotters comedy routine getting the audience involved we usually get 500700 people every sunday said weinberg the farm is expecting at least 3000 fans to show up for the films 30th anniversary party on june 15 were going to show the movie and also having a game under the lights between the ghost players and what we are calling the iowa dream team made up of celebrities with iowa roots were going to have dwier brown on the team casting burt lancaster robinson initially wanted james stewart to play doc graham aka moonlight graham a professional baseball player who only appeared in one major league game for the new york giants in 1905 and later became the doctor robinson was looking for a veteran star for the role of the elderly graham because the real doc graham was the star of is town horner hits the right notes its no secret that james horners oscarnominated haunting score  especially in the pivotal last five minutes of field of dreams  is one of the reasons the movie is such an emotional experience that seems to especially resonate with men horners score makes a huge contribution to the narrative and thats why its his third of 10 academy award nominations said film music historian and variety contributor jon burlingame the score is mostly synthesizerbased and horners delicate piano and tasteful electronic sounds provide an appropriately and effectively magical feel to the mysterious associated with kevin costners baseball field and the ghosts of the 1919 black sox scandal yet near the end horner brings in a full orchestra to help realize the films full emotional potential busfield described the score as climbing a ladder musically and hits a note that i swear to god is like a dog whistle for mens emotions right when says you want to have a catch the music crescendos up and releases a veil i think men are moved in ways that theyre not normally moved i was absolutely moved by that robinson had originally wanted leonard bernstein who had earned an oscar nomination for his only film score for 1954s on the waterfront to compose the music we actually made an offer to bernstein and his agent just laughed at us and said lennys booked for the next five years so i thought well who else he always admired that horner found interesting ways of conveying feelings when i showed it to james and he cried when he saw the film it was the first time we had shown the film to someone who hadnt been part of it the filmmaker found it thrilling to work with the late composer i think the first three quarters of the movie was written in the studio said robinson he called it painting where he had written themes and then went into a small studio with just a keyboard and a couple of synthesizers and a couple of flute players and percussion players he just constructed it layer by layer in the studio the ending was a fully scored orchestra session actorturnedauthor dwier brown who played ray kinsellas late father john admitted that for 25 years that he was embarrassed that people would make such a fuss over me over field of dreams just because i had such a small part he waited all of those year for costner or jones to write a book about the experience when that didnt happen brown decided to put pen to paper and wrote if you build it he travels around the country making appearances at various baseball fields around the country like ray kinsella in the movie i kind of had a rough patch when i was a teenager with my dad said brown adding that his own father died right before he began the film in a funny way i look at this as my little penance id go and talk to other people about their dads and tell them about mine its kind of a great way to keep my dads memory alive with me im taking the mitt that he used to wear and that i used to wear as a little kid theres something very beautiful about that its just an actor and a stranger talking but its really kind of amazing how deeply you can connect because those memories stay with you much longer magic time that final scene between costner and brown was shot over several days at dusk  known as magic hour in the film business  because cinematographer john lindley and robinson noticed how extraordinary the light was at that time in the iowa countryside at the end of the day wed knock off a setup or two setups from a dusk scene said lindley phil turned a bunch of stuff into dusk i think that had a big effect and there were no special effects in the film phil and i had met with visual effects companies  very highend companies with very accomplished people who pitched ideas to him about how the players would appear  there could be a flash of light or they could sort of come out sparkly phil was the one who repeatedly said no i dont want any of that stuff in the end they just dissolve into the field it could not be simpler than that clean shaven center fielder writer jeff silverman was an entertainment editor at the los angeles herald examiner when his good friend robinson asked him to be one of the ghost players in field of dreams the two were friends and silverman had read the script as robinson was writing the script was fabulous silverman had to cut his shoulder length hair and long beard for his role as the ghost player who catches young moonlight grahams fly ball getting the ball to him was difficult especially because they wanted him to remain in focus eventually they brought out a machine that would spew out balls however the balls initially went into the field and over his hands so they lowered the machine that put me in the cross hairs of the  he noted i am wearing this old uniform that had been used in eight men out and im wearing the shoes rob lowe had worn in some soccer movie which were about four sizes too big for me the glove is an ancient glove theres no padding theres no webbing silverman realized the ball was screaming right at him so he had to make a quick decision  does he duck or put his hand up to catch the ball and possibly break his hand he broke his hand to make matters even more painful they had to keep shooting it again and again on other closeups and other angles my hand underneath got redder and redder and blacker and blacker i had to go to a doctor silverman had a blast the week he was there playing baseball having dinner several times with james earl jones and hanging out with the rest of the cast and he still sees the film about six or seven times a year because he knows that will help with his residual check i made a minor fortune from this movie silverman said laughing timothy bufield comments most popular oppenheimer leads critics
