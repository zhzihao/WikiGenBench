{"id": 71044387, "key": "Abandoned (video game)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandoned%20%28video%20game%29", "text": "Abandoned is the tentative title for an upcoming survival horror game being developed and published by Blue Box Game Studios, an independent video game company based in The Netherlands. Described as a \"cinematic horror survival shooter\" featuring \"realistic\" gameplay mechanics, Abandoneds premise centres around Jason Longfield, who must escape a forest after being kidnapped. A playable teaser of Abandoned, titled Abandoned: Prologue, is also in development and is planned to be released before the main game.\n\nOriginally announced as a PlayStation 5 exclusive title in April 2021, Abandoned drew significant media attention and hype due to the game trailer's stylistic similarities to Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, leading to speculation that Hideo Kojima was involved in the game's development. These rumours were discredited by Blue Box, its CEO Hasan Kahraman and later by Kojima himself.\n\nAbandoneds development has been troubled, with the game's concept and design being changed multiple times, and its gameplay trailer and release date were both repeatedly pushed back before Blue Box indefinitely suspended any tentative release dates for Abandoned and the Prologue in March 2022. Despite this, Blue Box has stated that Abandoned is not cancelled, and both games will be released \"when [they are] ready\". A Windows version of Abandoned is intended to be produced \"eventually\". However, the lack of substantive updates have led to accusations that the game is vaporware.\n\nSynopsis and gameplay \n\nAbandoned has been described as a survival horror game that follows a man named Jason Longfield, who awakens stranded in a forest. Through exploration, he realizes that he was kidnapped and brought to the forest for a \"dark purpose\". He is tasked with fighting against a cult and its leader, who is Jason's estranged older brother, and finding his way out of the forest. Jason meets up with other characters throughout the game, but the player must ultimately decide at the end of the game whether Jason will fight against, or join, the cult and his brother. \n\nAbandoned makes use of horror, and some first-person shooter, elements, and requires tactical uses of weapons to survive. The game utilizes a \"realistic approach\" to survival gameplay, whereby every action the player performs in the game has an effect; for example, sprinting can exhaust Jason and reduce his aim accuracy. It also uses motion-capture technology to determine how Jason will take damage in-game.\n\nBackground \n\nBlue Box Game Studios, founded in April 2014 by Hasan Kahraman, is a small Dutch video game development studio with roughly 10 full-time employees as of 2021. The studio's first project, titled Rewind: A Paranormal Investigation, held a Kickstarter campaign to garner funding, though the campaign was cancelled, as the studio had secured outside investment, allowing the game to be reworked into Rewind: Voices of the Past. However, after the scope of the project grew without further investment, the game was cancelled. \n\nThe prospect of a game centering around paranormal investigations continued into The Lost Tape, another cancelled project, and The Whisperer, which was cancelled on PC but saw a free-to-play release on mobile devices, though it was delisted shortly after. A mobile Japanese role-playing game titled Tales of Six Swords saw a similarly short-lived mobile release, though Kahraman claims that Blue Box plans to revisit the concept in the future. The Haunting: Blood Water Curse, a Fatal Frame-inspired horror game, was released into early access in 2020. After poor reception, the early access release was removed from digital storefronts, and Kahraman claims that development will be completed by outside studio CreateQ, with Blue Box acting as the publisher.\n\nAccording to Kahraman, the repeated cancellations of projects were due to lack of staff and fan interestâ€”in an interview with IGN, he said that the team's inexperience was largely to blame, and that the announcement of projects served to gauge a potential audience, and those projects were cancelled when the audience was too small.\n\nDevelopment and marketing\n\nInitial announcement and Hideo Kojima involvement rumours \n\nAbandoned was first announced as an open world, \"cinematic horror survival shooter\" game on April 7, 2021 via the PlayStation Blog, along with a minute-long teaser trailer. The trailer contains various shots of a winter forest, including shots featuring an abandoned building with graffiti stating \"Kill the Trespasser\", and a sign reading \"God's town\".\n\nAfter the game's announcement, Abandoned attracted significant media attention from users and media outlets, as it was believed that Japanese video game designer Hideo Kojima (and/or Kojima Productions) was involved in the creation of the game, rumoured to be a new Silent Hill entry. This theory, also known as the \"Blue Box Conspiracy\" or \"Kojima Conspiracy\", was pushed by the fact that Hasan Kahraman's name shared the same first initials as Hideo Kojima, leading to the belief that Blue Box and \"Hasan Kahraman\" was a pseudonym for Kojima, in the vein of the promotional stunt Kojima performed for the 2015 game Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, where he went under the pseudonym \"Joakim Morgen\" and had a fake Swedish game company called \"Moby Dick Studio\", and also to \"7780s Studio\", another fake company of Kojima's, which created the P.T. demo teaser for the cancelled 2015 game Silent Hills. Furthermore, it was discovered that \"Kahraman\" translated into Turkish as \"Hideo\". \n\nThe speculation surrounding Kojima's involvement led to the creation of a dedicated subreddit on Reddit, r/TheBlueBoxConspiracy, by fans of Silent Hill to discuss the rumours. In response to the rumours, Blue Box Game Studios released a statement the following day after the game's announcement on April 8, 2021 on their website disavowing their connection to Kojima or Konami, who owns the rights to the Silent Hill franchise. This was further disproved by VentureBeat journalist Jeff Grubb, who revealed that Kojima was in talks with Microsoft/Xbox for his next game, and not PlayStation. Despite this, rumours persisted due to various tweets from Blue Box linking the game to Kojima's Metal Gear and Silent Hill game franchises. On June 15, 2021, Blue Box posted a tweet seemingly referring to Silent Hill, which read; \"Guess the name: Abandoned = (First letter S, Last letter L)\". Blue Box subsequently apologized for the tweet and said it had been misunderstood. Similarly, on July 27, 2021, Blue Box shared a teaser for Abandoned featuring a blurred image of a person with an left-eyepatch that was compared to Solid Snake, the protagonist of Kojima's Metal Gear Solid series. In an interview to NME, Kahraman clarified that this was an image of the game's main villain, and not Solid Snake. Due to the repeated rumours, Kahraman had to speak to Konami to clear up his involvement.\n\nKojima remained quiet on the rumours surrounding his involvement in Abandoned until he addressed and discredited them during an interview on his Brain Structure podcast with Geoff Keighley on November 3, 2022. Kojima said that he was \"surprised\" by the extent of the rumours, which he did not take seriously until users began sending deepfaked images and messages to him en masse, and described the situation as a \"nuisance\". Kojima stated that he had continuously been sent these images for \"nearly two years\". He also stated that he had never met Kahraman, and that he \"wouldn't do the same thing twice\" with regards to his \"Moby Dick Studio\" stunt.\n\nRealtime Experience app and Abandoned: Prologue \nOn June 20, 2021, Blue Box revealed plans to release a \"Realtime Experience\" app (originally \"Realtime Trailers\") to the PlayStation Store. The app was touted as Abandoneds hub for \"interactive trailers\", where teasers and trailers of Abandoned and its gameplay would be revealed, with reveals to take place during Summer 2021. It was designed to render the cutscenes \"in real time\", and act as a showcase for the game's graphics and use of Unreal Engine 5. \n\nThe Realtime Experience app was scheduled for release on June 20; however, due to localisation issues, it was delayed to June 25 and then to August 10, 2022. Due to technical issues, the app immediately crashed and was unusable on day one, with a patch for the app being uploaded three days later. After being patched, the Realtime Experience app was criticised for only containing a five-second render of a man walking on a wooden floor, and the fact this render had already been teased on Blue Box's Twitter account a few days prior to its release. In an interview with NME six days later, Hasan apologized for the \"big disaster\" of the Realtime Experience app release. He blamed its failures on the team's use of Unreal Engine 5, which he felt was \"not recommended\" for use due to its early access state. In the same interview, Hasan also said he would be showing the trailer at Gamescom on August 25, 2021; however, this appearance never materialised.\n\nBy August 2021, Abandoned gameplay was changed from open world to \"a linear story\", which Kahraman claimed was done to maintain the game's high-quality graphics. He also announced that the game would receive a \"playable prologue\", which would act as a backstory/introduction to the main Abandoned game. Hasan intends to use the Prologue to fund the development of Abandoned upon its release. While initially plotted as a teaser, Hasan later clarified that the Prologue was now completely separate from the final game.\n\nIndefinite delay and asset leak \nOn March 31, 2022, Blue Box released a statement to Twitter announcing that Abandoned: Prologue had been delayed indefinitely, with Kahraman saying that it will come out whenever it is ready. Following this announcement, Blue Box Game Studios deleted a number of past tweets regarding future plans of Abandoned, leading to several publications to believe development on the game has stalled, or that it had been cancelled entirely. Kahraman denied these claims, and said it was due to the game's concept changing, though also stating that he regretted the decision to delete the tweets. In May 16, 2022, some of Abandoneds assets were leaked via Reddit, showing the game's concept had changed drastically from how it was originally characterized into a political thriller.\n\nReception \nAlthough highly anticipated upon its initial announcement, the lack of substantive updates surrounding Abandoned development have led to accusations that the game is vaporware. In October 2021, Blue Box staff members were reported to have received increased levels of harassment, doxxing and death threats towards them as a result of \"The Blue Box Conspiracy\". The game's troubled development has been compared to that of the upcoming 2023 video game The Day Before.\n\nGameSpot investigation \nOn June 3, 2022, GameSpot published an investigative report which accused Kahraman of \"toxic\" activities on a private chat room revolving around the game, in which he revealed scant development information but attempted a romantic advance on one of his artists, who later left the group, allowed a 12-year-old to insult other members with no consequences, and forced others to play Rainbow Six Siege with him. Leaked development assets also had a Silent Hill 5 logo on them, indicating that he sought to trick people into believing Abandoned was part of the Silent Hill series. Others close to Kahraman claimed that little to nothing of the game exists, with the game shifting genres numerous times, and that even the playable prologue was unlikely to be finished, making it largely a hoax.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\nIndie games\nPlayStation 5 games\nSingle-player video games\nSurvival horror video games\nUnreal Engine games\nVaporware video games\nWindows games", "unikey": "Abandoned (video game)", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Synopsis_and_gameplay", "Background", "Development_and_marketing", "Reception", "Notes", "References"], "contents": ["Abandonedhas been described as asurvival horror gamethat follows a man named Jason Longfield, who awakens stranded in a forest.Through exploration, he realizes that he was kidnapped and brought to the forest for a \"dark purpose\".

console exclusive yes but this is the new realityi prefer console gaming to pc anyway but for those that dont then theyll be getting the best from both ps and xbox it makes sense for the latter to release on pc but still not sure why sony are doing the same 1 14col_mccaffertymon 21st jun 2021 as for this game i guess well have to wait a bit longer for the mystery to be unravelledas someone once said in a film about an animal park turning to disarray hold onto your butts 1 15carlos82mon 21st jun 2021 the guy has done a great job in getting people talking about his game but i dont see why anyone thinks this has anything to do with kojima their twitter account dates back to jan 2015 before he even left konami plus there are some kisckstarter things dating back to 2014 how would he know then that konami would cancel his game and then licence it back to him at some point in the future 0 16dr_entmon 21st jun 2021 i am no longer convinced that its kojima behind this drama i think this

fanning the flames so i can see some backlash hopefully the game will be good enough to stand on its own also pc 0 25blinx01mon 21st jun 2021 this goes one of two ways1 its hideo kojima trolling us all and its silent hills hitting pc at a later date much like death stranding everyone rejoices2 it really is just a indie studio and theyve used the silent hill rumours as a way to gain promotion for an otherwise uninteresting game everyone rages 2 26loftimusmon 21st jun 2021 hideo kojima and konami are now following each other on twitter days before this bluebox reveal something is happening and you dont have to be on team real to see it 2 27adeathnotemon 21st jun 2021 sony isnt giving some random dude with no apparent real development history of note his own app download on the ps store i think when you pair all this weirdness with the bizarre death stranding trailer that was basically mgs it becomes pretty hard to think nothing is happening i think konami and sony are back working together and i think kojima is probably involved 0 28zupertrampmon 21st jun 2021 i just know im not installing an app just to watch trailers 1 29twitchtvpatmon 21st jun 2021 voltan i think its going to be turn out to be something  and honestly im excited for it even if its not silent hill i think it will be something cool 1 30matroskamon 21st jun 2021 carlos82 one really weird thing is if you write hideo into google translate and translate it into turkish you get this guys last name kahraman 1 31carlos82mon 21st jun 2021 matroska perhaps this developer has created a fake name or its pure coincidence of this is somehow true its a lot of effort to go through for no payoff 0 32milktastrophemon 21st jun 2021 dr_ent i can believe that sony pressured blue box to show something especially if sony is the private investor that fully funded their kickstarter back in 2014 if i was sony id be eager to finally see something from my investment after 7 long years 1 33milktastrophemon 21st jun 2021 matroska i think thats just coincidencebug with google translate if you spell kojimas name correctly in japanese then it translates to just hideo in turkishsomeone with a better understanding of japanese can correct me but i believe google is translating eiyuu to turkish kahraman instead of hideo which have the same spelling in japanese when using kanji 0 34bagwag82mon 21st jun 2021 ward_ting where did you hear such murmurings 0 35ward_tingmon 21st jun 2021 bagwag82 ive seen some stuff on reddit and just various stuff on twitter its all quite possibly just speculation at this point the reddit posts ive seen refer to a supposed leak but that suggest the date is 28th june sony have also recently filed a trademark application for psx playstation experience possibly alluding to a big playstation event incoming httpswwwredditcomrgamingleaksandrumourscommentsnp3cyta_new_playstation_experience_appears_to_be edit theres also the rumour of 8th july so at this point just pick any thursday in the coming weeks and hope theres an event  2 36djice1989tue 22nd jun 2021 guys if you use google translate and put hideo without kojima and translate it to turkish the name that comes up is kahraman which is totally weird and makes some interesting coincidence its true try it and let me know what you thinkim a believer after this 0 37starbuck2212tue 22nd jun 2021 col_mccafferty it makes sense for everyone to eventually release on pc ring some extra cash out of it at the end of its life and promote interest in a sequel or the next game from the studio which then drives people to console if they want it earlier than five years from now 0 38matroskatue 22nd jun 2021 milktastrophe yeah i pointed that out in another thread prior to that post youre quoting è‹±é›„ is hero in japanese eiyuu whereas hideo is ç§€å¤« and has no translation one possible explanation for google switching it to eiyuu and getting the hero translation is that the individual kanji in ç§€å¤« translate to excellent and man amongst other things so maybe google fudges that into hero since it cant find a translation for the two kanji together as a compound in japanese kanji are read differently based on if theyre separate like ç§€ and å¤« or if theyre in a compound like ç§€å¤«all that said its still an insane coincidence that after the various kojima and silent hill baiting the guys last name is what google translate gives you when you write out hideo in the english alphabet yeah its not the actual translation of ç§€å¤« but it is still what you get from the same name in our alphabet doesnt mean its actually kojima but at the very least id say kahraman is a fake name 0 tap here to load 38 comments leave a comment related articles baldurs gate 3 gets another massive patch

game studios says its received numerous death threats over the last few months online but unfortunately also physicallythe studio has been dealing with a looming conspiracy theory that started in june despite the games announcement having relatively little fanfare in april some silent hill fans are now convinced that the game is secretly a new instalment in the survival horror series its spawned its own subreddit called the blue box conspiracy which has a healthy mix of light ribbing and real convoluted messy theoriesdespite numerous protests from blue box game studios on its twitter page and an attempt from director hasan kahraman to defuse the rumours the silent hill theory still runs rampant the developer has played into the speculation on occasion but still firmly maintain that it has

previous trailer as it is actually happening on the viewers ps5 theoretically they could have any code in there to mess with it later and not play the same way its got to have some weird twist like

about it no one plays along game gets announced or not you either dont care because you didnt bother looking for something that isnt currently there or get a jolly nice surprise if it looks good everyone plays along they spend precious moments of their life hyping something that simply doesnt exist or may do but it will be less of a surprise when it finally has something to show anyway a

highly anticipated franchise they wouldnt more likely is blue box trading on silent hill imagery to keep the hype train rolling in one way i respect that high level trolling its a fine line to walk and if they fall the wrong side into being too blatent konami will crucify them on the other hand trolling is trolling its bad mkayfrom an outsiders perspective who doesnt really care either way the situation and the attendant reactions are quite hilarioussony currently have no news to share so this will keep the fires warm for a whilethough as someone else suggested whilst there is no real news

it to silhouettes later announcing rdr 2 without trying to go too far down the rabbit holethe other curiosity was shuhei yoshida after first tweeting about the abandoned app launch he responded to

that there most certainly is bad publicity and there are tons of examples that prove it keep in mind that most indie games are released and dont get any attention at all so for an indie game of a

upcoming horror game abandoned back in june those teases seem to have strange ties with metal gear solid developer hideo kojima and the silent hill franchise some believe its part of a secret plan to announce a new silent hill game while others believe its just hypegamescom a video trade show in cologne germany kicked off wednesday with opening night live those who believed in the conspiracy who call themselves team real were hoping for some big surprise from kojima that would confirm their suspicions however that didnt happenthe possibility of a new silent hill title sent many gamers down a rabbit hole to understand how blue box an unknown netherlandsbased developer could be linked to kojima one of the most wellknown developers in the gaming industry its created a lot of buzz around abandoned which hardly anyone cared about previouslyheres what you need to know about the theories around abandonedwhat is abandonedaccording to a playstation blog post from april the game is a cinematic firstperson horror survival shooter set in a highly detailed open world environment and favours a realistic approach to survival players step into the role of jason longfield who was kidnapped and left in a forest for some dark purposeabandoned will feature 60 frames per second and native 4k resolution visuals itll also make use of the ps5s dualsense wireless controller to let players feel each and every interaction during gameplay there are still no details on the games release datewhy is abandoned getting so much attentionon june 15 the blue box account on twitter sent a nowdeleted tweetguess the nameabandoned  first letter s last letter l reveal closing inps5 exclusive twitterthis tweet caused gamer communities across the internet to light up in excitement the most prominent game that fits the criteria laid out in the tweet is konamis psychological horror series silent hillthe original silent hill first was first released on the original playstation and became a favorite for horror fans followup games garnered more praise and grew the series fan base over the years silent hill downpour came out in 2012 and publisher konami has yet to make another game in the franchise as it stopped work on bigbudget titles in 2015though the company said in january thatit didnt cease making gamesaltogetherthose that came to this abandonedsilent hill revelation also likely remembered the mystery surrounding the ps4 game ptwhat was pt and hows it connected to abandonedback in 2014 sony quietly released pt on its psn store after the game was briefly teased during the companys press event at gaming trade show gamescompt is a horror game that takes place in one corridor in a house and it was created by an unknown developer called 7780s studio beating the game required players to figure out the final puzzle and their reward was a cut scene showing a digitized norman reedus walking through the streets of a city then came the big reveal a new game from metal gear solid director hideo kojima and movie director guillermo del toro called silent hillsthe reveal led many to the realization that pt actually stood for playable teaserfor those who saw the blue box tweet that appeared to hint at abandoned being a silent hill game everything made sense here once again was an unknown horror game from an unknown studioone user on reddit compiled even more evidence such as an interview with silent hill composer akira yamoaka saying a new game was coming this summer similarities between the blue box and playstation logo and a tweet from the developer mentioning snowflakes of blood which was the visual shown in a gamescom teaser in 2014 internet detectives also looked at kojimas social media feeds for other clues such as him taking a picture with a blue box and a june 9 tweet that had the words silent and hill in it there are also strange coincidences between kojima and the founder of blue box hasan kahramanwho is hasan kahramankahraman is the founder of blue box and creator of abandoned when people began looking into this mystery they noticed strange similarities between kahraman and kojimathe first obvious one is both having the same initials h and k while thats hardly mindblowing internet detectives dove further intranslating both developers namesand saying that hasan kahraman is turkish for handsome hero while hideo kojima means the same thing in japanesethere was also the question of timing around tweets from the studios blue box is based in the netherlands but many of the tweets from the developers account come at what would be after midnight in the netherlands but about 7 am or later in japanwhen the chatter about a connection began spreading in june kahraman posted a video on the blue box twitter account saying he has nothing to do with kojimaquick message from hasan pictwittercom1oveamvu3w blue box game studios bbgamestudios june 22 2021 im a real person and im not really associated with hideo kojima kahraman said in the video im not an actor im not working on silent hillwhat is the abandoned realtime experience appon july 27 blue box tweeted an image promoting the abandoned realtime experience app for the ps5 the developer said in later tweets that the app would let players experience how the game looks and feelsare you ready we are pictwittercomdqjwjot99s blue box game studios bbgamestudios july 27 2021 one thing internet detectives immediately recognized was how the blurry image in the tweet looks like a man wearing an eye patch like the metal gear character big bossthe app was available for download on the ps5 on aug 13 after some delays by blue box what many found after downloading it was a screen showing trailers and demos but only one clip of a person walking was available to watch the only available clip in the abandoned realtime experience app blue box game studiosthis is the same clip the developer tweeted on aug 10are you ready pictwittercom4oi5fjgdfe blue box game studios bbgamestudios august 10 2021 the lack of additional content left many scratching their heads there was also the question of why the app was approximately 5gb but consisted of only a 10second clip as of aug 24 only one video was available to watchanother confounding question is how an indie developer that has yet to release a game on the ps5 could release its own app its a strange move from both blue box and sony which would have to approve the app in the first placeso is abandoned another silent hill gamewell dont hold your breath as strange as some of these things may be theres still reason to doubt blue box is a cover for a secret silent hill gamewhile some internet detectives inspected every possible link between blue box and kojima others focused their attention on blue boxs history

dont know how anyone can continue to believe hideo kojima is in some way involved because of just how suspicious this entire thing is the last two weeks was really stressful to us the team is very tired we were hoping to release the app today and i know a lot of you have been looking forward to it so thank you very much for that we really appreciate that however ive decided to delay the app

almost would have forgiven a delay to august if theyd not already delayed the launch from tuesday to friday like what were they going to fix in 3 days if the issue was clearly significant enough to delay them by two months doesnt bode well for their development schedule for the actual gamethey would have been better off not announcing the app at all and just dropping it when it was readywhole

kojima connection but as ive sat with it i now think its just been too messy to be kojima say what you will with kojimas trolling but he always promoted his games in very deliberate ways it always felt like there was a plan to the madnessthis by contrast has been so messy from the fake trailer confirmed by the dev to the strange trailer app to this delay for againa trailer appnot a gameat this

way the devs have gone about handling the situation is so messy that it makes me question if kojima is involved because it doesnt fit his typical mo but you are right kojima productions liking the
