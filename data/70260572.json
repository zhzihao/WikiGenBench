Due to Baltimore's large amount of gentrification, the city accounts for a significant amount of the United States gentrification. The gentrification of Baltimore has occurred throughout the city, but particularly in the neighborhoods surrounding the Inner Harbor in Central Baltimore and East downtown Baltimore. The gentrification of Baltimore has occurred through the addition of new housing, increased commercial spaces, and more. The transformation that has occurred throughout the city of Baltimore has many benefits as it improves the city in various ways. However, many others feel that gentrification is unfavorable for Baltimore because it displaces current residents from their homes due to rising prices in newly gentrified neighborhoods.\n\nHistory \n\nAround the 1930s, the Baltimore to be found today began to be developed. During this time, various new commercial areas were integrated into central downtown Baltimore, making it a destination with many attractions. This brought many people to Baltimore; thus, many new roads were developed. However, during this time, one of the most significant problems in Baltimore began: redlining. With redlining, certain minority groups, especially African Americans, were not allowed to live in specific neighborhoods of Baltimore. This created an extremely segregated city that can still be seen today, especially as the city is being gentrified.\n\nLater on, from the 1960s through the 1980s, the city continued to be developed as officials attempted to organize the city. During this time, lots of funding was put into the city to incorporate new low-income housing, new schools, and more. However, the city began to struggle due to violence, poverty, and addiction. These problems have taken over many Baltimore neighborhoods, which are now being gentrified due to the lower price of the property.\n\nEffects of gentrification \nWith the arrival of wealthy developers coming into low-income neighborhoods, the landscape of Baltimore, Maryland, is completely changing. One of the most significant ways developers gentrify neighborhoods is by developing new housing. Most developers purchase run-down or cheap properties in low-income communities and build entirely new properties. These new properties tend to be much more expensive and attract wealthier buyers. Thus, building more expensive housing often can displace the current residents out of their neighborhood because they can no longer afford to live there. For example, in East Baltimore, the average home price jumped from $65,008 in 2000 to $203,000 in 2010. In Baltimore, this has been a massive problem as many residents have been displaced due to higher prices post gentrification. However, the displacement in Baltimore is unique because you see both white and black displacement, which is not very common.\n\nIn addition to housing, developers have reimagined various neighborhoods in Baltimore city by adding new commercial spaces. New retail spaces in Baltimore have been built from the ground up, and many older buildings have been transformed into new spaces. One example of the gentrification of an older building in Baltimore is the Sagamore Pendry Hotel, which is now a luxury boutique hotel in a gentrified area, but it used to be a pier where new immigrants arrived. Additionally, there is a wide variety of new stores and restaurants throughout the city. Generally, this has been a positive thing for the city of Baltimore, as it is attracting more people to come into the city after a period when many feared the city. New commercial spaces have also helped improve the economy as more individuals have been able to open new restaurants and stores where they can make a living.\n\nGentrification debate\n\nFor gentrification \nMany argue that all of the gentrification occurring throughout Baltimore, Maryland is highly positive for the city and taking it in a better direction. The main argument for those who favor gentrification is that all of the change throughout Baltimore beautifies the city. They feel that most of Baltimore's new commercial and residential spaces transform previously neglected properties into attractive buildings. As new buildings are popping up all over the city, it can also be seen that many neighborhoods appear to be cleaner than before. Due to many neighborhoods being revitalized by developers, property value has significantly increased throughout the city of Baltimore, which many are extremely pleased about.\n\nMany also argue that gentrification is excellent for Baltimore because it provides many new job opportunities. There are a variety of jobs available once a neighborhood goes through gentrification. For example, while the neighborhood is in the middle of being transformed, there are many construction jobs available due to all of the development occurring. However, that is not where it ends. Post-construction, there are many new jobs available where there are typically a variety of new retail spaces and restaurants brought into gentrified areas for individuals to work.\n\nAlthough there is still a significant amount of crime throughout the city of Baltimore, gentrification is helping reduce crime rates around the city. This brings many people to be in favor of gentrification because, in the past, crime has been one of the most significant issues in Baltimore, and many efforts have been ineffective in reducing crime.\n\nAdditionally, many are in favor of gentrification because it increases education levels. Most college graduates throughout the country are likely to move to urban gentrified areas like Baltimore, Maryland. Thus, many lower-income students living in these gentrified neighborhoods are more likely to attend college because they are exposed to role models in their neighborhood who graduated college. Overall, all of these factors have helped bring people back into the city of Baltimore after a period when people avoided the city.\n\nNot for gentrification \n\nThe second side of the gentrification debate is individuals who feel that gentrification is only doing more harm than good for the city of Baltimore. The main argument of these individuals is that gentrification is displacing thousands of individuals throughout the city. The displacement occurs due to two factors: not being able to afford the cost of living anymore and being actively forced out of their homes due to eminent domain law. Once these individuals are forced out of their homes and neighborhoods, they are often not provided with any assistance in finding new affordable housing. Gentrification has also created a racial divide through the displacement of minority groups throughout Baltimore, as more money is invested into predominantly white neighborhoods.\n\nAnother reason that many people feel that gentrification is not good for the city of Baltimore is because the transformation occurring is only done for wealthier individuals. Baltimore's leaders have primarily focused on the more affluent neighborhoods to bring money back into the city. However, this has only made people more enraged as the people who need support in their communities are not receiving it. With the mission of bringing wealthier residents into the city, very little low-income housing is being developed as gentrification occurs. Overall, many do not support gentrification efforts because they feel that the gentrification occurring throughout Baltimore creates a wealth divide and continues to create a racial divide after so much progress.\n\nMany argue that gentrification forces a loss of history throughout the city; thus, they are not in favor. Many historic sites are demolished for new spaces to be built. However, once those landmark sites are torn down, the vibrant history of Baltimore can be forgotten. For instance, in 2019, many residents of the Woodberry neighborhood in Baltimore were outraged because two 19th-century stone homes were demolished to make way for a new apartment complex.\n\nGentrification by neighborhood\n\nHampden \n\nHampden, a vibrant neighborhood in Baltimore, has seen extreme gentrification. This neighborhood has become an attractive area for anyone to live in, but especially college students and graduates. As the number of college graduates in this neighborhood has almost tripled, the home prices nearly doubled. As more people have moved into Hampden, a variety of new restaurants and stores have opened. Thus, Hampden has become a desirable location for people from all around Baltimore to visit. Due to the increased desirability of Hampden, developers continue to come into the neighborhood to develop new housing and commercial spaces. However, most of the developers in Hampden attempt to preserve the area's history by transforming current buildings rather than building entirely new structures. For example, many old textile mills have been turned into apartments and offices in this neighborhood.\n\nCanton \n\nCanton, a waterfront neighborhood that used to be an industrial area of Baltimore, has become one of the trendiest areas of Baltimore, Maryland, due to gentrification. This neighborhood has seen an immense addition of commercial spaces. These commercial spaces include restaurants, hotels, gyms, and various stores. The variety of new commercial spaces has attracted many young professionals to move to Canton. Thus, developers have also gentrified the area by adding a variety of new housing ranging from row homes to apartments. The home values in Canton have increased by 107% from 2000 to 2016 as the neighborhood continues to be transformed. Canton has seen so much gentrification that it has been ranked the 16th most gentrified zip code in the United States from 2000 to 2016.\n\nFederal Hill \n\nFederal Hill, a neighborhood of Baltimore that looks over the Inner Harbor, has undergone a tremendous amount of gentrification, making it a lively and desirable community. The neighborhood is filled with historic buildings that various developers have revitalized. Alongside these historic buildings are a variety of brand new structures that have been built as the community has been gentrified. These new buildings are both housing and commercial spaces. Like many of the other gentrified areas of Baltimore, there are various stores, restaurants, bars, and more in this community. Many outdoor spaces have also been added to Federal Hill as the neighborhood has been gentrified. These new attractions have caused many young professionals and families to move to this neighborhood. All of the community spaces that have been added to Federal Hill throughout the gentrification have brought the community together.\n\nSee also \n\n Gentrification in the United States\n Gentrification of Atlanta\n Gentrification of Miami\n Gentrification in Philadelphia\n Gentrification of Chicago\n Gentrification of San Francisco\n\nReferences \n\n2000 establishments in Maryland\n21st century in Baltimore\nCulture of Baltimore\nGentrification in the United States\nSocial class in Maryland", "unikey": "Gentrification of Baltimore", "summary": "The gentrification of Baltimore, Maryland, began in 2000 and continues to transform the city by redeveloping specific neighborhoods to appeal to wealthier residents.

america activist dr marisela gomez notes that residents were being forced to relocate with no plan for how they could return to benefit from this good ebdi originally lacked community representation in its planning process as a result the save middle east action committee smeac was formed for years smeac fought for fair compensation and relocation terms the group disbanded in november 2009 and was later replaced by brace although displaced residents were promised a path back the area was a dead zone for a decade and a half due to slow progress investment and construction were further delayed by the great recession gresham told the newsletter that he didnt learn that his home was being acquired until a smeac organizer came to his house and told him i didnt read it in the paper i didnt get a letter i didnt get any phone calls  all i knew was that they were acquiring my property he said you would not have known it at all they had no formal way of letting you know that your property was being acquired and you were going to have to move a 2018 article in the baltimore sun describes gresham who later became president of smeac as among those who avoided displacement he emphasized to the newsletter that he and a few dozen others were only able to do so because of years of advocacy i didnt get displaced because it was designated for me to stay no it was more like they dragged out the process and we had to do a rally and articles and so many things he said it was a constant battle to get them to hear what we were saying and what they promised i dont want to call it another jim crow gresham said that smeac had to fight almost day and night for safe demolition middle east baltimore stories chronicles how demolition procedures led to property damage and rat infestations as well as psychological strain that manifested as increased crime and physical ailments like asthma and lead poisoning lead poisoning which has long afflicted poor and black youth in baltimore is known to decrease cognitive function increase aggression and ultimately worsen the cycle of poverty fueled by racist policies like redlining a 2016 report by the annie e casey foundation attributes residents concerns about lead poisoning to a controversial study by the bloomberg school of public health and the kennedy krieger institute in 2000 researchers spread fertilizer made from human and industrial waste on the lawns of several homes in east baltimore while hopkins claimed that the fertilizer successfully mitigated lead and that the community had been informed many activists and lawmakers questioned whether the experiment had exploited poor black families ebdi used wetting to reduce the spread of leadcontaminated dust during demolition it also informed and educated residents extensively about planned construction according to the report the demolition protocols developed for the east baltimore revitalization initiative set a new national standard in the battle against lead poisoning and more broadly in the field of responsible redevelopment the report reads the authors of the report note that smeac had called for demolition to be paused until safety guarantees were implemented eventually ebdi and its partners agreed to work toward guaranteeing that demolition would not harm residents and took several key steps to achieve that goal the report reads vernice millertravis a national leader in environmental justice who helped coin the term environmental racism served as a member of an independent panel overseeing the demolition in the report she is quoted as commending ebdis safety measures i have not seen this level of caution and sensitivity in a community of color or lowincome community in the us she said it sets a new bar about how community development should be done in the 1930s the home owners loan corporation deemed nonwhite neighborhoods risky for mortgage support by outlining them in red on residential security maps to this day redlined neighborhoods in baltimore are structurally disadvantaged ordinance 610 a 1911 housing segregation law in baltimore was a precursor to redlining nationwide it was in part the legacy of a report initiated by the universitys former president daniel coit gilman about a century later daniels assumed gilmans position in 2009 in 2018 daniels told the guardian you can make the moral case of why given the bounty of resources that we have its incumbent on us to share with the city but the other thing is to make clear that this is an enlightened form of selfinterest it is inconceivable that hopkins would remain a preeminent institution in a city that continues to suffer decline as baltimores largest private anchor institution and marylands largest private employer hopkins seeks to create economic opportunities that are inclusive of diverse people and create wealth for individuals and communities this mission statement adorns the universitys web page on hopkinslocal an initiative launched in 2015 due to the universitys enlightened form of selfinterest middle easts own neighborhood anchor institutions suffered for instance middle east baltimore stories mentions that the sweet prospect baptist church had been debtfree for decades before it was demolished although ebdi helped the church move to a nearby neighborhood the new building required hundreds of thousands of dollars of renovation the church received a building the book reads but not a means to preserve the congregation similarly gresham highlighted that people who had been living in the same place for four generations were uprooted by ebdi during the great migration thousands of black people came to baltimore to escape racism in the south and find employment families came here to have a better life only to later find out that its almost like another  i dont want to call it another jim crow  displacement of their lives you put down your roots and now someone says to you this area is designated for the rich and famous and the poor and poverty doesnt fit in gresham said can you imagine what thats like when you were running away from something and running into something that almost has the same feeling how has hopkins impacted neighboring communities of color ebdi states on its website that it is helping displaced residents return to what is now eager park by defraying closing and moving costs narrowing financing gaps and ensuring that one third of houses are affordable according to the website displaced renters received vouchers to rent affordably throughout the region and homeowners received five times the value of their homes on average allowing them to move mostly stable neighborhoods mortgage free however many residents gresham said already lacked financial stability before ebdi making them unlikely to return in 2018 the baltimore sun reported that just one in 10 displaced residents has returned or plans to and fewer than a quarter have expressed interest president and ceo of ebdi cheryl washington told the baltimore sun that ebdi hired a consultant to track down displaced residents with whom it had lost touch gresham questioned the ebdis ability to do so many residents moved out quickly he said and have been scattered across the city for almost two decades additionally though an ebdi survey found that 85 percent of displaced residents said they were better off after being relocated gresham explained why this statistic is misleading you have to imagine the pain and uncomfortableness first you move me out like im a cattle and then you tell me yeah you can get back but read the survey he said many people didnt even respond to the survey because they were devastated between january 2006 and september 2018 ebdi has yielded 288 hires from baltimore only 23 of whom were ebdiimpacted residents since ebdi began 490 local workers have retained employment by working on ebdi projects almost 40 of them are from baltimore 161 of them from minority groups and a quarter of them are from east baltimore 107 from minority groups they came in and disrupted our lives we thought that money would help to build businesses not only for the community but by the community and with the community that didnt happen gresham said the reinvestment money could have been a blessing for so many reasons gresham added
