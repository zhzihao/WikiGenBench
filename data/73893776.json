{"id": 73893776, "key": "Decarbonization of shipping", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarbonization%20of%20shipping", "text": "The decarbonization of shipping is an ongoing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping to net-zero by or around 2050, which is the goal of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The IMO has an initial strategy. This includes the practice of lowering or limiting the combustion of fossil fuels for power and propulsion to limit emission of carbon dioxide ().\n\nBackground \n\nInternational trade of goods is primarily sea-based, followed by pipeline, air, and then rail/truck. Most sea vessels that transport goods use diesel or fuel oil, generating carbon dioxide. The maritime shipping industry transported almost 11 billion metric tonnes of cargo in 2022, which accounts for nearly 3% of global carbon dioxide emissions. These emissions and potential oil spills can pose chronic risks to coastal regions, marine life, and ultimately ocean health in terms of pH and ecological diversity. A decrease in pH would make the oceans more acidic, lower free carbonates (which are a component of shellfish and corals exoskeletons/scaffolds), and decrease  conversion to carbonates. These are some of the environmental effects of shipping.\n\nIssue \nSince marine shipping moves nearly 80% of goods by tonnage and the trend of shipping is expected to double and may triple by 2050, decarbonization strategies are critical in tackling global warming and marine health. Many major shipping entities have pledged to cut carbon emissions with the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. An industry forum called the \"Getting to Zero Coalition\" has set a goal of carbon neutrality by 2030, which cannot be met by a single approach.\n\nIn 2021 the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated that governments and shipping industry leaders, such as Maersk, Mediterranean Shipping Company, and France’s CMA CGM \"have shown interest in decarbonization projects.\" In 2021 the European Union (EU) signaled \"strong policy support for maritime decarbonization through their ‘Fit For 55’ (FF55) proposal, a package of 14 legislative proposals.\"\n\nGroups that represent more than 90% of the global shipping industry have called for a globally applicable carbon tax on the shipping industry's emissions, in order to provide financial incentives for implementation of new technologies, and provide necessary funding for research and development.\n\nA 2021 article states that extensive research and development is needed, as well as retrofitting and operational changes. The rapidly changing industry response to decarbonization can be monitored in a weekly newsletter, several conferences, and a two day overview online course. \"Delay beyond 2023 would mean the future transition for international shipping is too rapid to be feasible,\" says Alice Larkin. \"It has to be all hands on deck for international shipping now.”\n\nProposed solutions \nVarious approaches have been proposed or implemented, such as the use of low carbon feedstocks (methanol, ammonia) or hydrogen and electrification with energy storage, construction of ships with lighter materials with high tensile strength, and digital operations for enhanced transport efficiency and container ship packing. Some ships are partially automated with a skeleton crew to reduce the potential for human error, using telemetry based on ship onboard sensors, cloud computing, and machine learning or neural network-based decision-making.\n\nIn larger shipping operations, a digital twin is created to simulate the trajectory based on real data from the actual ship, allowing operational managers to predict future scenarios and make decisions. These tools must be transparent yet safe to avoid hijacking and interference with other ships or transport, while also being low-cost for most operators to deploy and maintain.\n\nElectric ships are useful for short trips. Sparky, an \"all-electric 70 tonne bollard pull harbor tugboat\", is \"the first e-tug of its type in the world.\" Sparky was christened in Auckland in August 2022. The world's first hybrid tugboat, the Foss tug Carolyn Dorothy, began operation in 2009 in the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach. The tour boat Kvitbjørn, (\"polar bear\"), operates in Svalbard, just a few hundred miles from the North Pole, piloting a newly developed Volvo Penta hybrid-electric propulsion system. In June 2022, the Danish electric ferry Ellen made a record 90 km voyage on a single charge.\n\nNet zero fuels could be used, for example in ammonia or hydrogen-powered ships. Green hydrogen and ammonia produced from zero-carbon electricity (solar or wind power), are \"the most promising options ...  to decarbonize shipping\" in 2022, according to the World Bank. Biofuels can be net-zero fuels if \"the production of fuel removes a quantity of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere that is equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide emitted during combustion.\" On July 21, 2022, Carnival's AIDAprima \"became the first larger scale cruise ship to be bunkered with a blend of marine biofuel ... made from 100% sustainable raw materials such as waste cooking oil, and marine gas oil (MGO).\" As of April 2022, \"ammonia, methanol and methane are viable deep sea shipping fuels, while compressed and liquid hydrogen are not\", according to a World Economic Forum article. The world's first hydrogen-powered tugboat was launched in May 2022, at the Astilleros Armon shipyard in Navia, Spain, and is scheduled to enter service in the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in December 2022. Dual fuels engines, fuel storage options, and retrofit readiness are important to ensure adaptability. Stena was the first shipowner in the world to retrofit a large vessel for methanol, converting its ro-pax Stena Germanica in 2015. Stena is partnering with methanol producer Proman and with MAN Energy Solutions to retrofit engines for dual-fuel operation on diesel and methanol.\n\nWind power is a traditional choice for shipping. Wallenius Marine is \"developing the Oceanbird, a cargo ship powered by wind that can carry 7,000 cars.\"  K Line is installing Seawing wind propulsion systems on five of its bulk carriers. The kite parafoils, which fly about 300 meters above the sea level, are estimated to reduce emissions by about 20%.\n\nNuclear marine propulsion has been suggested to be the only long-proven and scalable propulsion technology that produces practically zero greenhouse gas emissions. Small modular reactors for shipping are being investigated in South Korea.\n\nThe European Investment Bank invests in port infrastructure to improve sustainability and reduce global transport chain emissions, including efforts that mitigate pollution from moored ships, such as shoreside electricity and ship garbage receiving facilities. Between 2018 and 2022, the Bank funded €1.3 billion on ports.\n\nExternal links \n\n Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping\n\nReferences \n\nInternational water transport\nGreenhouse gas emissions\nFossil fuel phase-out\nClimate change mitigation", "unikey": "Decarbonization of shipping", "summary": "The decarbonization of shipping is an ongoing goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping to net-zero by or around 2050, which is the goal of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).[1] The IMO has an initial strategy.

owners for zero emission vessels cozev in 2021 multinational climateleading companies in their 2040 ambition statement emphasized the urgent need for policy support across various jurisdictions to enable new climatefriendly shipping fuels to be adopted and come to scale quickly specifically they called for measures that would enable scalable zero carbon fuels to become economically viable which requires those fuels to reach price parity with fossil fuels as soon as possible a strategy for the transition to zeroemission shipping by umas for the getting to zero coalition defines scalable zero emission fuels as fuels that have the potential to achieve nearzero ghg emissions on a lifecycle basis while also scaling production in line with the pace of the transition in practical terms this means efuels produced with renewable energy that do not rely on biogenic inputs in the longrun because we believe the most sustainable biofuels eg those generated from waste will become limited in supply relative to demand across sectors this generally points to ehydrogenderived fuels as the most feasible scalable and affordable solution set for the maritime sector to achieve paris agreement goals efuels are defined as renewable fuels of nonbiological origin in the eus renewable energy directive we will use the term efuels as shorthand in this article we are confident such fuels will not be adopted at the vast scale necessary without strong policy support just as fossil fuels have benefited from historically in july 2021 policymakers in the european union eu started the process of providing strong policy support for maritime decarbonization through their fit for 55 ff55 proposal a package of 14 legislative proposals aimed to help the eu deliver on its ambition to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 compared to 1990 levels by the year 2030 for the first time in eu climate legislation maritime shipping is included in five proposals a new fueleu maritime proposal a low ghg standard for shipping fuels meant to drive the industry toward adoption of lower emission fuels a revision to the eu emissions trading system to include maritime shipping a revision to the alternative fuels infrastructure regulation meant to raise the availability of lng by 2025 and shoreside electricity supply in main eu ports a revision to the energy taxation directive to end the tax exemptions for conventional marine fuels and incentivise the uptake of alternatives a revision to the renewable energy directive that creates a new eu economywide target of at least 40 share of energy from renewable sources in 2030 and a new renewables target of ghg intensity reduction of at least 13 by 2030 collaboration across the maritime value chain is necessary to rapidly decarbonize this essential sector of the global economy this includes collaboration with policymakers who play a critical role in ensuring new zeroemission maritime fuels become mainstream and competitive with fossilpowered shipping in the coming decade we applaud the eus global leadership in crafting policies to accelerate maritime decarbonization in the fit for 55 package and are hopeful that we can further ramp up ambition as the package is refined  elisabeth munck at rosenschöld global sustainability manager ikea supply chain operations in addition to filling this void in policy leadership the inclusion of maritime shipping in the ff55 package demonstrates the eu is acknowledging and attempting to align climate goals and economic objectives of the shipping industry the maritime sector is crucial to the economy of the 27 countries that make up the eu in fact 75 of external trade and 31 of internal trade rely on maritime transport and four of the largest container shipping companies in the world  ap mollermaersk msc cma cgm hapaglloyd  are based in europe as the eu is a major importer of goods all major global carriers regardless of flag or port of origin would be mobilized to engage constructively in the transition and use new efuel options as they call on eu ports collectively these proposals would enable a gradual transition to efuels helping address concerns about the high cost and disruption of delayed action and provide shippings cargo owner customers much better shipping options to meet their supply chain emissions reduction goals as the eu considers the five proposals on the table to drive decarbonization of the shipping sector the benefits for climateleading companies must be front and center as a business that relies on maritime transport and has set an ambitious target for decarbonization of the maritime part of our supply chains through cozev we have a direct interest in ensuring eu policies are ambitious and create pathways for adoption and scaling of new fuels that offer long term and economically viable solutions we are ready to do our part and we now need policymakers to provide the supportive environment for zeroghg shipping fuels to flourish  alexander ralfs director supply chain management  logistics tchibo gmbh add a subtarget for use of a specific percentage of efuels by 2030 on the fueleu scope specifically we recommend a subtarget of 6 of the energy demand used by ships be fulfilled by efuels by 2030 establish a multiplier for use of efuels that allows every tonne of such fuel to count multiple times toward achievement of the fuel eu ghg intensity reduction targets so that investment in efuels is more attractive and exclude fossil fuels from eligibility to meet the targets we recommend a multiplier of 5 which means that every 1 tonne of efuel used counts for 5 tonnes towards the targets include language to incentivize or mandate the use of fuel efficiency technologies or energy efficiency measures labeled a hardtoabate sector the shipping industry has avoided meaningful decarbonization regulations and policy for too long today we have the necessary technology knowhow and growing private industry willpower to move toward longterm solutions that can decarbonize this sector on a trajectory that makes both climate and business sense the eus 2050 net zero policy has already mobilized billions of euros in investment in green infrastructure if eu policymakers raise the ambition of the fueleu maritime proposal they will open a similar floodgate of investment and innovation toward decarbonizing the maritime sector unilever has set a goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain by 2039 and shifting to zero emission shipping throughout our global supply chain is an important step it is essential we collaborate with our peers and logistics partners to explore new solutions but we also need significant support from governments and legislation that promotes a smooth and costeffective transition to zero emission fuels as a cargo owner and a founding signatory of cozev we therefore fully support the proposed changes to the fueleu maritime proposal which will raise the ambition level and better facilitate the transition to zero emissions shipping  michelle grose vp global logistics and fulfillment unilever by making the changes recommended here our keen interest in the maritime components of the ff55  and fueleu maritime proposal in particular  would blossom into fullthroated applause we encourage meps to seize this rare and important opportunity by

docking brazil photo thomas sennett  world bank the obstruction of the suez canal earlier this year served as a vivid reminder of the importance of maritime transport for economies around the globe the blockage was resolved within a matter of days but a much more existential challenge remains for the shipping industry simply put how to tackle climate change the maritime transport industry is under increasing pressure to curb its greenhouse gas ghg emissions which account for approximately 3of global emissions annually the sector is highly dependent on heavy fuel oila highcarbon fossil fuel that closely resembles tar in light of this decarbonizing the current global sailing fleet of approximately 100000 ships represents a mammoth task that will require more energy efficient ships as well as revolutionizing the industrys entire fuel supply chain shippings ghg emissions trajectory as foreseen by the imo initial ghg strategya new world bank report the potential of zerocarbon bunker fuels in developing countries finds that energy efficient technology alone will not be enough to decarbonize the industry rather the feasibility of reaching netzero emissions hinges on the adoption and use of zerocarbon bunker fuels moreover a second report the role of lng in the transition toward low and zerocarbon shipping shows that alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas lng have an uncertain and at best limited ghg reduction potential so what are the most promising options available to inform the decarbonization of the shipping industry leveraging expert support from the university maritime advisory services the world bank analyzed three categories of future zerocarbon bunker fuel options biofuels biofuels such as biomethane bioethanol and biomethanol are produced from a biogenic feedstock which is currently derived from plants agricultural waste or in the future algae biofuels emit co2 when burned in an internal combustion engine but retrieve co2 from the atmosphere during the production of their feedstock thus they are usually labeled as netzero fuel from a lifecycle perspective ammonia and hydrogen the second category of zerocarbon fuels considered were green and blue ammonia and hydrogen green hydrogen is produced from water using renewable electricity while blue hydrogen is made from natural gas making use of carbon capturing and storage technology either kind of hydrogen can then be used as a fuel or be further processed into ammonia both hydrogen and ammonia can be used in internal combustion engines and fuel cells synthetic carbonbased fuels synthetic carbonbased fuels such as synthetic methanol and synthetic methane are produced by combining green or blue hydrogen with carbon retrieved from the atmosphere main zerocarbon bunker fuel options for shippingafter assessing each zerocarbon fuels features from an environmental economic and technical perspective ammonia and hydrogen stood out as the most promising future zerocarbon bunker fuels due to their scalability their costeffectiveness and low ghg lifecycle emissions in the long term furthermore both fuels can be produced from either renewable electricity resulting in green ammonia or hydrogen as the preferred option or from natural gas with the resulting carbon emissions captured and securely stored underground resulting in blue ammonia or hydrogen as a potential alternative in the near term thereby overcoming any concerns regarding production capacity constraints the analysis conducted does not rule out biofuels and synthetic carbonbased fuels but found some limitations regarding their sustainable largescale availability and costcompetitiveness a shipping triple win cleaner cheaper and a trilliondollar opportunity particularly for developing countries according to estimates decarbonizing shipping represents a more than 1 trillioninvestment opportunity for business and development the transition of the shipping industry toward ammonia and hydrogen is likely to change the landscape of the global bunker fuels market creating new opportunities for developing countries particularly for those with significant renewable energy resources such as brazil india malaysia and mauritius future investments in this more inclusive and decentralized bunker fuel market will support developing countries general economic development as well as help them achieve their wider energy transition flexibly and at a lower cost a highlevel assessment conducted within the report outlines which countries are best positioned to become future producers suppliers or exporters of zerocarbon bunker fuels heatmap indicating the potential for countries to produce green ammoniahydrogen for shippingto initiate and accelerate shippings energy transition the playing field between polluting and nonpolluting fuels must be levelled for example through the implementation of a meaningful carbon price this would compel ships to pay for each ton of ghg released into the atmosphere applying the polluter pays principle revenue generated from such a mechanism could be used to fund further research on zerocarbon fuels as well as support a fair energy transition in developing countries that need it most such as small island states while a meaningful carbon price would create enabling conditions the uptake of zero carbon fuels can ultimately only be facilitated through global cooperation between ship owners shipyards engine manufacturers fuel producers and distributors classification societies and charterers progressive organizations such as the getting to zero coalition play a crucial role in fostering such crossindustry alliances until zerocarbon bunker fuels become available at scale ship owners are encouraged to invest in noregret options such as energy efficiency and maximum fuel flexibility technologies while decarbonization may look daunting as a largescale transformative challenge the shipping industry has already weathered three energy transitions during its long historyfrom womanpower to wind from wind to coal from coal to oil decarbonization of the shipping industry must be recognized as a once in a generation opportunity both developed and developing countries alike stand to benefit from a wide range of business and development opportunities as they tap into a more adaptive and accessible

ships 10 february 2023 share nine south korean organisations have signed a memorandum of understanding mou to cooperate on the development and demonstration of ships and offshore systems powered with small modular reactors smrs the partners will also develop marine systems and the production of hydrogen using molten salt reactors msrs representatives from the partners mark the signing of the mou image kaeri the mou was signed in gyeongju city hall on 9 february by representatives from gyeongju city and north gyeongsang province as well as shipping companies hline shipping hyundai merchant marine hmm janggeum merchant marine sinokor and wooyang merchant marine plus the korea atomic energy research institute kaeri korea register of shipping and the korea ship  offshore plant research institute kriso this agreement was prepared to establish a cooperative basis for commercialisation in the future through the development and demonstration of smr technology for propulsion of large ships they said in a joint statement under the mou the nine organisations agreed to cooperate in the development and demonstration of smrs for marine use the development of smrpropelled vesselmarine system interface technology and response to licenses and permits to nurture experts in nuclearpowered ship operation and establishment of industrial infrastructure the partners will jointly develop a molten salt reactor suitable for use in marine vessels they noted that with msrs there would be no need to replace nuclear fuel during operation of the ship and when an abnormal signal occurs inside the reactor it is designed so that molten salt  which is liquid nuclear fuel  hardens preventing serious accidents from the source its compact design also makes it easy to load large quantities of cargo unlike diesel engines it is also an ecofriendly energy source that does not emit carbon nuclear power is the best energy source for responding to climate change and realizing carbon neutrality because there is no carbon emission during electricity production said north gyeongsang governor lee cheolwoo we will lead the nuclear power renaissance and build a global innovative nuclear power industrial ecosystem centered on the paneast sea last month south korean shipbuilder samsung heavy industries announced it had completed the conceptual design for the cmsr power barge  a floating nuclear power plant based on compact molten salt reactors  and obtained the basic certification of the design from the american bureau of shipping the company plans to commercialise the cmsr power barge by 2028 once the detailed design of all of the plants power generation facilities has been completed researched and written by world nuclear news related topics nuclear propulsion research and
