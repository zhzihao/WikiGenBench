{"id": 72828448, "key": "Visual album", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual%20album", "text": "A visual album is a type of concept album in which the album is accompanied by a feature-length film or individual music videos for every song. Usually, the film, or \"visuals\", emphasize the album's overall theme and serve as the \"visual vehicle\" that enhances the experience. \n\nThough music films and videos accompanying albums are not new in popular culture, the term achieved prominence in modern usage after the release of American singer Beyoncé's 2013 self-titled album. However, Beyoncé's 2006 sophomore album B'Day is generally considered her first \"visual album\" despite it being described as a \"video album\" at the time. Music videos for every song were also released in 2007's B'Day Anthology Video Album, which companioned the release of the album's deluxe edition. Beyoncé is such often credited as the leading figure of the visual album format due to her innovative audiovisual output. Jonna Lee's project iamamiwhoami is said to have been promoting the \"audio-visual album\" format since 2009, and the band Animal Collective had similarly earlier described their experimental 2010 album ODDSAC as a \"visual record\".\n\nDefinitions \nThe definition of what constitutes a visual album remains a subject of debate. Being a largely experimental medium, its execution varies from artist to artist. According to Screen Rant'''s Megan Summers, \"visual albums are linked music videos or films released in conjunction with a record\". In one of the first articles written about the artform, Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects notes that \"visual albums stage, sometimes with interruptions, the majority of a musician or band’s LP...proclaiming albums to be cohesive works of musical artistry rather than conveniently divisible bits of audio information\". According to Judy Berman of Pitchfork, visual albums result from the \"synergistic connection between music and cinema that dates back to the latter art form’s birth\". While films like Purple Rain and A Hard Day's Night are classics that combine music and longform visuals, Kylie Lynne of AllMusic argues that such films \"had the corresponding album as a soundtrack with the majority of focus on the storyline and dialogue when the music was not playing\", separating them from visual albums in which the music is the primary audio component.\n\n History and development \n\n The pre-MTV era \nThe synergy between music and cinema has existed since cinema's early history, with the first talkie in 1927, The Jazz Singer, being a musical. When it became clear that talkies were to become the dominant form of cinema, there was a significant rise in musicians making use of the visual medium to bring their music to new audiences. Artists like Bessie Smith and Fred Astaire took advantage of this and appeared on television performing their songs. Soon enough, the music film as a concept would become a cultural phenomenon in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania, when the Beatles released A Hard Day's Night. The following decade saw a massive leap in the music industry's use of visual media, with Blondie's Eat to the Beat, released in 1979, being the first album in the rock era to be accompanied by videos for every song.\n\n MTV era and the longform film \nThe rise of MTV and the popularity of Michael Jackson in the 80s cemented the status of music videos as integral to the music industry. Jackson would eventually stretch his cinematic ambitions to feature-film length with 1988's Moonwalker, just as Prince had done four years earlier with Purple Rain. While these were important in the eventual development of the visual album, none of these would fit into the modern definition of the term. Lemon Jelly's 2005 album '64-'95, and Beck's 2006 album The Information were both released with videos for each track. Beyoncé's B'Day Anthology Video Album marked another significant release in this era, which companioned the deluxe edition of 2006's B'Day and featured videos for every song.\n\n Streaming era \nThe beginning of the streaming era offered artists several options of making their musical projects easily accessible to fans. The Swedish electropop group iamamiwhoami published a series of music videos in 2010. Described as an audiovisual project, it was later released on their \"audiovisual album\" Bounty. The band continued the tradition, releasing Kin in 2012, Blue in 2014, and their subsequent albums in an audiovisual format.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-08 |title=Time Is iamamiwhoamis Worst Enemy and Best Friend |url=https://www.popmatters.com/jonna-lee-iamamiwhoami-2022-interview |access-date=2023-01-25 |website=PopMatters |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe next instance of a visual album was Beyoncé's 2013 self-titled release. Having started recording the album in the summer of 2012, she had the idea to make it a visual album in early 2013 and hence began filming videos for every song secretly across the globe as she embarked on The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. The album, having had no prior announcement or promotion, was then released as a complete surprise in the early hours of December 13, 2013. Unlike B'day's year-long wait for a complete visual companion in 2007, Beyoncé and its 17 videos were made available exclusively through the iTunes Store immediately upon release. The music and videos were \"designed to be consumed as a comprehensive audio/visual piece\".\n\nBeyoncé would reinvent the visual album format again with her following studio album Lemonade in 2016. Instead of filming separate videos for every song, she opted to create an hour-long short film to companion the album. Releasing a cryptic trailer 6 days before the film's exclusive premiere on HBO, Lemonade was described as a \"world premiere event\". The project's true purpose as a companion film for Beyoncé's sixth studio album was revealed on April 23, 2016 as the film premiered. The film has since exclusively streamed on Tidal. It was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards and won a Peabody Award for its \"contributions to the greater cultural landscape.\"\n\nThe third studio album by the English musician Thom Yorke, Anima, was released on 27 June 2019 in conjunction with a 15-minute visual album of the same name on Netflix. Ed Sheeran's sixth studio album, - (\"Subtract\"), was released on 5 May 2023 with music videos for every song.\n\nOther artists like Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Solange, Halsey, and Sia have all released projects described as visual albums to different streaming services. Though the films often accompany the albums, the visuals are at times released at a later date, as in the case of Black Is King (2020), the visual accompaniment to The Lion King: The Gift (2019).\n\nReferences \n\n \nAlbum types\nFilm genres\nVisual music", "unikey": "Visual album", "summary": "\n", "outlines": ["Definitions", "History_and_development", "References"], "contents": ["The definition of what constitutes a visual album remains a subject of debate.

street curbed leave a comment search search close behind the scenes dec 18 2013 beyoncés creative director todd tourso on her new album and keeping secrets by amanda dobbins todd tourso hasnt been home in six months which is understandable once you learn what hes been up to as beyoncés creative director  he started in june  tourso spent the last half of 2013 flying all around the world filming videos for her elaborate topsecret visual album he even directed a couple too in the wake of beyoncé vulture spoke with tourso about the creative process the albums visual themes and how the hell they managed to keep it under wraps it wasnt so hard he says what did your role as creative director entail exactlyi would pitch her directors i would listen to the songs with her and then figure out what directors should work on what videos on a few of the videos the directors sort of came up with concepts on their own but a majority of them beyoncé had a concept in mind that i would help her refine so when you started working with beyoncé in june this idea of the visual album was already rollingno video had been shot yet and it was a very loose idea she knew that she wanted to have a video for every single song and the songs existed at that point no did the songwriting process and the video ideas go together thenit sort of started to coalesce more as we went along when i met her in june i think there were three or four songs that made the album that were done already and then the rest came as we were working on videos it started to come together where she was actually watching rough cuts for the videos in the studio and tweaking the music to fit the visual what kind of adjustments would she makeshe would rewrite some lines or she would add certain audio or she would add bridges sometimes i think it would complete the picture of where the audio needed to go were any songs particularly changed by the videoi dont think it was anything super dramatic i think it was more textural you know rocket changed a bit in regards to the video mine and flawless too but it was more just adding this break here or adding this snare there no songs 180ed because of the video a lot of themes or images that repeat from video to video but they were all directed by different people how did that workshe does have so many collaborators but shes really really in control and really has the overarching vision in her mind so when she works with people she knows what she wants to get out of them and shes able to bring the best out of them and really their work becomes hers you know what i mean what about something like the trophy which pops up throughoutwe knew at the beginning that there was this concept of embracing imperfection a lot of the stuff that has led her to this point in her career  and was sort of an underlying theme  was the fight to become a champion all the things that you sacrifice along that road and things that you do to yourself to make yourself the best in whatever everyone elses eyes is i cant really speak for her but a lot of the stuff we tried to touch on is once you hit your thirties and youre a mother and youre a wife a lot of the things that you fought for and you thought were everything kind of become meaningless so we wanted to embrace the chaos of life the trophy for us kind of represented the futility of that struggle and thats why we tried to sort of use it in a way that almost defaced it there seems to be fire in every single video am i making that upno no  not at all i think that i was particularly interested in duality of metaphors and to me it spoke to that concept i was speaking of before  it alludes to her star search moment where you think this is your life and you think this is everything and then you look back on it and its just one stripe or one thing at the time that felt like the end of the world but actually made you the person that you are so the fire i was interested in how it represented so many different things from sex to death to cleansing to me that kind of duality of an image depending on your perspective spoke to the greater whole of the record what does beyoncé say no to i would say of all the celebrities that ive worked with every single thing that ive thought was a brilliant idea that shes shut down or changed has actually resulted in a much better final product you directed two videos heaven and jealous did you choose those particular songsi think she started heaven the night after the xo shoot she went to the studio and started it that night and then a week later the song was pretty much done she sent it to me and saidi want to shoot this video in puerto rico what do you thinkand before i could really even complete my thought she sent me an entire treatment that she had written for it with reference images story lines originally her main inspiration for that song and that video was watching her mother lose one of her best friends so beyoncés treatment  which was incredibly detailed and fleshed out shockingly so at seven in the morning  was juxtaposing this gutwrenching sad song with really happy visuals of two girls who are best friends doing all these amazing things and then at the end of the video you find out that it was one of the girls bucket lists and shes actually dead so we went out there to shoot that and in shooting it we realized that a lot of the more epic moments that we had originally wanted to capture came across as contrived and a lot of the natural things that we had filmed looked very real and very beautiful how much of that is happening on set versus editingits really both i would say that video in particular because we were out of america and because it was a really small crew  it was really just like her her stylist hair makeup security and me and our dp and our producer  it was a tenperson team so it was really kind of like we would just wake up and meet and just go shoot and kind of figure out scenarios on the fly you only had ten people on that set but there are videos where that was surely not the case how did you keep it a secretits funny that everyone freaks out on that but the sad truth is i think its just like in real life where if you want it to be a secret you just dont tell anyone what about all the people in the videoseveryone who was in it knew they were in a beyoncé video and they would ask when it was coming out and we would be like i dont know sometime next year well see and then i would be like oh we might not even use it it might just be scrapped everyone was just so happy to be working with her and with the directors that i dont think it was as difficult to give those kind of answers when did you know that it was coming out last thursdayits obviously been our strategy for a minute and it just kept shifting depending on where we were at with the final audio and final edits and everything as far as locking in on that date maybe a couple weeks is there a video that you are particularly attached todefinitely for me the heaven video was really special because it was the first time i directed a music video it was such a beautiful experience being in paradise with a very minimal crew that really had a great time and also filming drunk in love in miami was super super fun my favorite is flawless the dance especiallyyeah i really love that one too that was another  you know we had done half the video and we watched it and beyoncé knew that it needed a dance moment that would be iconic that people could pick up on and then we went back and reshot that part because after seeing the video and after the song coming together she was like this needs a cool dance that anybody can do is that intentionally a single ladies reference the double ring hands oh i dont think so i actually definitely dont think so im not sure where that came from  i know that she worked on the choreography for that with the les twins and chris grant and i dont think it was meant to be that theres so many things that  and i think thats part of being open to the creative process and letting things happen  that i actually think that you tend to do things subconsciously that way and their meaning might manifest later theres been a lot of things that i read about in blogs and reviews where i think oh thats really smartitll give it more meaning in retrospect related stories beyoncé video
