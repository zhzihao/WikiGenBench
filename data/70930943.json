It is based upon the novel of the same name by Tess Wakefield. It stars Sofia Carson and Nicholas Galitzine. Its story follows an aspiring singer-songwriter named Cassie and a Marine named Luke, who agree to get married in order to receive military benefits and pay their debts. The film was released on July 29, 2022.\n\nThe rights for the film were originally owned by Alloy Entertainment, but Netflix bought the rights from them in August 2021. The production for the film started soon after that, with most of the scenes for the film shot in locations around Riverside and San Diego, California.\n\nPlot \nCassie Salazar is a waitress/bartender and performs with her band, The Loyal, at a bar in America. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes six months earlier, she struggles to afford insulin and works multiple jobs to try and make ends meet. One night, she serves a group of Marines who are soon to be deployed to Iraq. One of them, Luke Morrow, flirts with Cassie, but she turns him down. Luke has his own set of difficulties: he became an addict after his mom's death, and although two years clean, he still owes $15,000 to his dealer, Johnno. Estranged from his retired marine dad, he asks his brother for help, but his brother declines.\n\nCassie proposes to Frankie, a childhood friend and Luke's bunkmate, to benefit from the health insurance granted to military spouses. Frankie explains he plans to marry his sweetheart Riley. Although Luke overhears and advises against a fraudulent marriage, he realizes both their financial difficulties could be solved by getting married as Luke will make more money and Cassie will have access to military spouse healthcare. They agree to marry before Luke deploys and share the extra pay. Their plan is that after a year, they will file for divorce.\n\nFrankie, the witness at the wedding, gives Cassie the ring he plans to marry Riley with, asking her to keep it safe. After, the newlyweds go to the bar with Frankie and Luke's fellow marines. Cassie argues with one of them over a toast about hunting down Arabs, resulting in an argument with Luke, but to keep up appearances they pretend to make amends. That night, he admits he is scared of both the marriage and Iraq. Cassie comforts him and they share an intimate night together.\n\nThe next morning, the Marines are deployed. Before he gets on the bus to leave, Luke gives Cassie contact information for his brother as she is now his next of kin. Cassie and Luke start sending emails and video calls to one another to keep up the ruse. She tells him that she wrote a song, \"Come Back Home,\" for the Marines. She performs it for them, uplifting their spirits after a rough day.\n\nThe song goes viral. Luke asks Cassie if he is her muse, and Cassie concedes he may be. One night while performing, she receives a call that Luke has been severely injured by an IED explosion and will be coming home to recover. Cassie tries to contact Luke's brother but accidentally contacts his father, angering Luke, as his father is a retired military police officer who would turn them in if he found out about their arrangement. While Luke is in the hospital, he tells Cassie that Frankie was killed in action. At Frankie's funeral, she gives Riley the ring she promised to keep safe for him.\n\nLuke, now using a wheelchair, moves into Cassie's apartment after being discharged from the hospital. Luke makes a wedding ring out of his dog tag chain for Cassie and they re-decorate their house to showcase their marriage for his father, who picks him up for physical therapy. Cassie adopts Peaches, a golden retriever, as an emotional support animal to aid in Luke's recovery.  Luke's rehab and their cohabitation inspire Cassie to write another song, \"I Hate the Way,\" which she performs fabulously at Whisky a GoGo and captures the attention of record companies.\n\nStill seeking his money, Johnno breaks Cassie's mother's window and threatens Luke. That night, Cassie's sugar level drops, sending her into shock. Luke helps her recover and they share a kiss. The next day, Luke beats Johnno up, gives him money and tells him to stay away. Instead, Johnno informs Cassie's mother about Luke's past. When Cassie confronts Luke, he reveals he had stolen his father's car to sell but crashed it instead, forcing him to borrow money from Johnno to pay him back. Cassie asks for a divorce and demands that he leave her apartment by the next day. When Luke returns home from a run, he is detained by the MPs, who were informed by Johnno of their fraudulent marriage. Luke's father calls Cassie to tell her of the charges and the impending trial.\n\nAt his trial, Luke pleads guilty, taking full responsibility and says that Cassie was unaware she violated military law. Luke is sentenced to six months in the brig after which he will receive a Bad Conduct Discharge. Luke covered for Cassie and told the judges she had nothing to do with this and she was spared of criminal charges. \n\nCassie's band is signed to a label and are opening for Florence and the Machine at the Hollywood Bowl. During the show, on the same day that Luke is to be jailed, Cassie sings her newest Luke-inspired song, \"I Didn't Know,\" which she apparently wrote while waiting for Luke's trial.  After the show, she rushes to confess her love for Luke before he is sent off. Luke gives her his wedding ring and tells her \"it's real now.\"\n\nAs the credits play out, six months later Luke is released from prison, Luke and Cassie are a happily married couple at the beach where they're enjoying a picnic with Peaches.\n\nCast \n Sofia Carson as Cassie Morrow née Salazar, a waitress, bartender and singer at a bar and Luke's \"wife\"\n Nicholas Galitzine as Luke Morrow, a U.S. Marine Lance Corporal and Cassie's husband\n Chosen Jacobs as Frankie, Luke's friend and Cassie's childhood friend, whom she babysat when Frankie was younger\n John Harlan Kim as Toby, Cassie's record label owner\n Kat Cunning as Nora, Cassie's co-worker and best friend\n Linden Ashby as Jacob Morrow Sr., Luke and Jacob Morrow Jr.'s father\n Anthony Ippolito as Johnno, a drug dealer who Luke owes $15,000\n Scott Deckert as Jacob Morrow Jr., Luke's brother\n Sarah Rich as Hailey Morrow, Jacob Morrow Jr.'s wife\n Loren Escandon as Marisol Salazar, Cassie's mother\n Breana Raquel as Riley, Frankie's girlfriend\n Nicholas Duvernay as Armando, Luke and Cassie's rival\n A.J.

In the announcement it stated that she would also be an executive producer, and write and sing the original songs for the soundtrack. In that same month it was revealed that Charles Melton had been cast as the male lead, but right before production started in August 2021, Galitzine was reported to be taking over the role.\n\nIn September 2021 Deadline reported that Chosen Jacobs, John Harlan Kim, Anthony Ippolito, Kat Cunning, Sarah Rich, Scott Deckert and Linden Ashby would round out the cast for the film. In the same report it was announced that Grammy nominee Justin Tranter would write and produce the original songs, with Carson co-writing and performing additional music.\n\nFilming \nThe principal photography for the Netflix original commenced in August 2021 and wrapped up in October of the same year. Filming took place in Los Angeles County, San Diego County, Riverside, and Austin, Texas.\n\nThe director, Allen Rosenbaum, worked with military adviser and Navy Veteran James Dever to get the Netflix project to film on base at Camp Pendleton. The first proposition was rejected, however, after Dever added his touch to the script, permission was granted to film. Deadline Hollywood described the film's budget as \"thrifty.\"\n\nMusic \n\nGrammy Award-nominated singer/songwriter Justin Tranter wrote and produced the original songs for the Netflix original film. Carson also co-wrote and performed additional music for the project. On July 12, 2022, Hollywood Records released \"Come Back Home\" to help promote the film. Upon the Netflix release, the official soundtrack for the film was made available digitally. The tracklist consist of eight songs, all performed by Carson and includes four original songs co-written by Carson. On August 3, 2022, Sofia Carson released the official music video for \"Come Back Home\".\n\nReception\n\nViewership \nAfter spending one day on Netflix the film took the number one spot on the daily popularity charts, replacing The Gray Man from its eight-day run in USA. Within the first week of release, Netflix's Global Top 10 revealed that the film had 48.23 million hours watched. In its second week, the film had a total of 102.59 million hours viewed, which was as many hours as the next five films combined. By September, the film had logged 228.6 million hours watched.\n\nIn December 2022, Netflix announced the movie was the 3rd most watched movie of 2022 spending 6 weeks in the top 10s picking up 240.48 hours between July 24, 2022 and September 4, 2022.\n\nCritical response \n On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100, based on six critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nClaire Shaffer from The New York Times critiqued the film, stating that the film \"had the potential to be a poignant melodrama — or maybe a sharp satire\" but \"wallows in contrived plots and subplots\". The reviewer also criticised the leads. Luke Y. Thompson from The A.V Club was also critical, negatively describing the love scenes that \"convey neither heat nor emotional substance\", and the songs as \"overstuffed\". David Ehrlich, reviewing from IndieWire, stated that the film was overwrought and \"can’t settle down even though its two lead characters give each other something to be sure about for the first time in their lives\".\n\nAnti-military activists were angered that the movie portrayed the American military in a largely positive light and some claimed that some language used by characters in the story were offensive, which Allen later clarified was a part of the character development.\n\nFuture \nDirector Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum stated that \"they’ve been casually chatting about doing more, but nothing is official.\" Carson added that she would love to see a sequel but \"who knows. You never know!\" Galitzine has expressed uncertainty with this stating \"I try and let nature take its course with these projects\" as well as citing the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nReferences\n\nAwards and nominations \nWon Best Musical Moment at MTV Movie & TV Awards\n\nExternal links \n\n2020s English-language films\n2022 films\n2022 romantic drama films\nAlloy Entertainment films\nAmerican romantic drama films\nEnglish-language Netflix original films\nFilms based on romance novels\nFilms based on young adult literature\nFilms directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum\nFilms set in 2021\nFilms set in Los Angeles\n2020s American films", "unikey": "Purple Hearts (2022 film)", "summary": "Purple Hearts is a 2022 American musical romance film created for Netflix and directed by Elizabeth Allen Rosenbaum.

military propaganda  teen vogueskip to main contentnewslettersearchsearchstylepoliticscultureidentityvideosummitshoppingnewsletterculturenetflixs purple hearts uses diabetes insulin rationing for military propagandai have been on the bathroom floor with only a few units left like cassieby zoe wittaugust 15 2022mark fellmannetflixin this oped writer zoe witt explores the netflix film purple hearts and the harmful ways it uses diabetes healthcare and tropey romance to make a promilitary story spoilers aheadrationing insulin for 9 months while working in a restaurant turned me into a fullblown anarchist  it was my v for vendetta moment thats why its puzzling that when the same thing happens to cassie salazar played by sofia carson in purple hearts she marries a conservative marine for health insurance and transforms to be politically moderate purple seemingly the moment she has an opportunity to use an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor perhaps the greatest unintended truth purple hearts has to offer is that some women are willing to reorient their world towards a fascist government if it personally benefits themcassie is a singersongwriter and recently diagnosed type 1 diabetic who is rationing her insulin while working numerous jobs in the beginning we see a few instances of cassie testing her blood sugar drawing the last units from her dwindling back up vial of insulin and showing signs of dangerously high blood sugar but after an admittedly very realistic trip to the pharmacy we dont see cassie taking insulin or testing her blood sugar again until she gets a pump and continuous glucose monitor after they are married the movies depiction of diabetes is actually above average especially given that media representation of rationing is basically nonexistent but as a diabetic of nearly 20 years i was ultimately left disappointed and deeply confused by the role the chronic illness plays in the plotthe lack of access she has to healthcare informs her desperation  and her idea to marry someone in the military to get quality health insurance its a confusing sequence of events why when cassie was in the midst of rationing nearly dying in a bathroom stall was she trying to solve her shortterm problem with a long term solution problem solving and thinking about the future is nearly impossible when youre rationing and close to death meanwhile marrying someone and getting insurance benefits takes immense paperwork weeks to months at best fully insulindependent diabetics like cassie can die in just a few days without insulinpurple hearts drops the core issue the absolute urgency of insulin needs to instead tell a bizarre version of a military love story when reached by teen vogue netflix declined to comment in all my time rationing i never ran out of both my long and short acting insulin at the same time so days with no mention from cassie of getting new insulin while she seems completely fine simply doesnt make sense we never get details about that because as we see less of cassies diabetes management we see more of her problematic romancefor the first fifteen minutes of purple hearts i almost believed cassie was the socialist her character purported to be so i was confused about how she would end up in love with luke morrow played by nicholas galitzine hes a marine with a temper who immediately and throughout the movie at best tacitly endorses and at worst blatantly displays white supremacy xenophobia and toxic masculinityover the course of the film cassies pride and black lives matter bumper stickers on her old subaru outback begin to feel like posturing in one scene she wears a the future is female shirt while she unsuccessfully proposes marriage for health insurance to her longtime friend and marine frankie played by chosen jacobs luke who is frankies bunkmate takes issue with the shirt because he feels personally attacked by it luke and cassie clash again and again in one fight luke makes comments about cassie scamming the government to get the insulin she needs to survive and also asks if her mother is in the us illegally she incomprehensibly decides to meet with him to talk again after another fight with luke cassie suddenly switches up her whole persona apologizes and agrees to a mutually beneficial fake marriage cassie resorts to an elaborate plan for a faux marriage but doesnt even attempt to find other diabetics or mutual aid groups that might be able to help her  or even a person who isnt in the military that has good insurance to marryafter their wedding ceremony the night before lukes deployment another marine encourages the indiscriminate killing of arabs cassie calls him out while luke stays silent before throwing a little tantrum and stalking out they fight and luke writes off the marines behavior by calling it bullshit bravado emphasizing instead how scared he is to leave for iraq without guys like armando do you really think this country would be safe from terrorists luke argues while cassie briefly attempts to counter that absurd question their argument is cut off by their need to uphold the appearance of romance the film translates that conflict into sexual passion that same night they somehow end up sleeping together before he leaves a series of distressing choicesby the time luke is deployed cassie is unfazed by her new husbands part in the us military agenda and despite not knowing him at all is somehow madly in love im sure many citizens of the countries around the world that the us has military bases really do wish our troops would come back home but after we see cassie perform her new song by that name luke frankie and a few of their fellow marines step on a landminecourtesy of netflixfrankie is killed and luke is disabled by the incident  two tropes with one explosion kill the young black guy who is the least maga marine weve met and disable the terrible white guy so he has context to make his redemptive character arc now cassie a newly disabled person herself is helping to rehabilitate luke were spending screen time watching cassie get him an emotional support animal instead of exploring a diabetic getting a service animal to detect low blood sugar the ableist trope of luke overcoming his war injury attempts to serve as a metaphor for him somehow magically becoming a better person i dont know how i could detest this moreits almost as if rationing insulin was just a convenient plot device to get us to the heart of the movie promoting a military thats facing notably low voluntary recruitment i knew before i watched the film that medical device company medtronic had provided an insulin pump for the character but the movies associations also extend to the us military in an interview with militarycom director elizabeth allen rosenbaum talks about camp pendleton rejecting purple hearts requests to film until they brought on a military advisor and rewrote some of the script we did have to adjust a little bit of dialogue to show a more balanced depiction of the marine corps rosenbaum said retired marine corps sgt maj james dever was the advisor and according to rosenbaum everything went through him all of it was passed through his eyes hes also worked on projects like american sniper and wandavisionthe film has simultaneously continued to break streaming records while also facing backlash since its release on july 29 carson responded to the criticism in an interview with the hollywood reporter it was a love story with a really important socialpolitical message she said the last five years have been some of the most divisive in our country or at least in my generation the story is about two hearts from opposite ends of the world  one red one blue raised to hate each other  who through the power of love come together to form a beautiful shade of purple that to me is the heart of our movie and a message i was really passionate about tellingwhats more american than thinking two people in southern california are from opposite ends of the world the united states plans to spend 773 billion on its military in 2023 when instead our government could be funding closedloop pump technology and unlimited analog insulin for every diabetic on the planet among other things the film and carson are naive to suggest these grave injustices are not in any way connectedupholding characters like luke in the midst of 2022 is dangerous we all know a luke the kind of guy who would call some casual misogyny simply dudes blowing off some steam the kind who will be pleased when genderaffirming healthcare is banned and he doesnt have to worry about all that pronoun nonsense anymore they are flawed at the beginning and that was intentional rosenbaum told variety in a statement after the criticism they also feels intentional  his flaws are equated with hers its a false equivalency we see on the internet all the time one person is promilitary at best apolitical and at worst actively interested in taking away the rights of marginalized people the other is an occasionally annoying outspoken feminist who might be on twitter too much there is no they and we want to hope for growth and redemption of course but that kind of growth cant be shown in this kind of mass market twohour romantic drama the attempt to do so feels forced and unnuanced another movie attempting to invoke sympathy for soldiers kicking a soccer ball with the iraqi kids whose homeland theyre forcing themselves intoi have been on the bathroom floor with only a few units left like cassie and theres not a doubt in my mind i would have let myself die before i let this godforsaken country convince me to marry a marine to get insulin if carson galitzine and the purple hearts filmmakers are at all confused about the backlash to the movie perhaps its best i direct them to the words of the late desmond tutu if an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that
